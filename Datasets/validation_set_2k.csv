13475,lao airlines,9,lao skyway customer review,luang prabang to hanoi i was impressed the plane was modern seemingly brand new atr food onboard was odd but nice and the crew efficient
2308,air mauritius,6,business class seat does not lie flat,return flight from london to mauritius in business class friendly welcoming staff on the whole and good service good food and excellent champagne and wine offerings the main issue is the business class seat which does not lie flat and leads to interrupted sleep business customers have access to the skyteam lounge at heathrow which is excellent the lounge at mauritius is reasonable but the food offerings there are poor
1307,air canada rouge,5,very disappointed,toronto to venice no tv or inseat entertainment poor meals for me clogged sink in the restroom small space for luggage i was expecting more i am very disappointed definitely will try to avoid flying with air canada rouge in the future
15413,olympic air,1,olympic air customer review,economy class athenscorfuathens service onboard excellent both flights in the early morning and cabin crew was very welcoming the usual choice of beverages was offered along some biscuits filled with vanilla

22819,wow air,1,disputing the amount i paid,los angeles to keflavik i purchased a flight in may of 2018 for a flight in march 2019 i have been checking periodically to see if the seats are filling up i purchased through a third party vendor and apparently it is only for the economy fare so no luggage or seats so i have been watching to see if i need to purchase them early i havent been able to see the seats since november so in february i emailed customer service to ask why they told me because my flight was cancelled i guess they do not fly out of los angeles anymore much to my surprise because my flight is in 3 weeks no one ever emailed me or called me to notify me i would have been at the airport and had a big surprise now i am trying to get a refund and they are disputing the amount i paid they do not want to pay me approx 300 even though i have sent over screen shots of my credit card showing i paid a total of 1300 it is ridiculous
12645,jin air,1,very poor service,seoul to manila clark i am traveling with my disabled husband and the front desk who print our boarding pass was terrible she gave us a terrible bad service she didnt care about all my request for my husband like wheelchair and seat assignment in short they dont care about those disabled passenger they just gonna do what they want very poor service
13902,lion air,3,experience was not pleasant,denpasar to jakarta i picked lion air because it was the cheapest of all budget airlines compared to air asia citilink etc the flight was delayed by 15 hour and another 30 minutes delay on flight apparently this is a regular thing to happen according to my other flight the onboard experience was not pleasant the seatbelt that i have was broken so it couldnt lock which is very dangerous the washroom is not well taken care of the toilet seat was broken and the soap container was extremely dirty the flight attendant are ok the seats are ok there werent any in flight entertainment only the security procedure pamphlet if you can find it entertaining thats good for the price difference of 20 dollar it was not worth the flight so i would rather choose other better budget airlines
8547,egyptair,2,nofrills low cost,egyptair business class ms768 barcelona to cairo was bad the seat was old and uncomfortable it barely reclined and the footrest did not work the entertainment system on my chair didnt work i had to change seats and even then the sound had a hissing buzz and the screen so small that it was impossible to read or enjoy a movie i asked for a seafood meal and i received a salad with four pieces of lettuce two pieces of bread fish and some fruits overall the meal was disappointing but the fish fresher than normal on the same flight the cost of the ticket is disproportionately steep because of the monopoly that the company has on the route given the vintage condition of the carrier it should be priced as a nofrills low cost
10945,hawaiian airlines,5,the food was very poor,staff are lovely but the food was very poor you dont even get a bread roll i am a small person so i was ok but for a man not sure how they would go however they were very generous when it came to wine
3682,airlink,3,wouldnt fly this airline again,there was a single person manning the counters at checkin my bags were overweight so was directed to another counter to pay for the excess which is no issue but that took 20 mins as they kept allowing other customers in front of the line in flight food was a joke now have been waiting at the baggage conveyor for over 30 mins and no bags have come out i expect this is due to the fact we arrived earlier than scheduled and were redirected to a parking bay other than the one designated for us and therefore assume this has caused some confusion and delay with the luggage being off loaded and reclaimed i wouldnt fly this airline again to be honest
19919,thai airasia,1,terrible service by airasia,on november 20th 2022 we had requested wheelchair assistance with airasia flight from kl to bangkok bkk on arrival there was no assistance my wife had to climb down stairs we had notified them that she could not negotiate stairs i complained but no help whatsoever so again on january 18th flight from bangkok dmk to penang no wheelchair on arrival after 20 minutes a lift arrived a wheelchair was provided but no assistance i had to push my wife from the aircraft to the exit negotiating 3 steep ramps to get to airport lounge level trying to carry 2 cabin bags also when i complained that i am 78 years of age this is ridiculous air asia ground staff lady said you look fit enough thank you for that air asia have refunded the 300 baht that i had paid for the wheelchair but to my air asia account they say that i cannot get this returned to my bank account i have to use it with them we do not intend to fly air asia again return flight on january 24th same problem in dmk no wheelchair on arrival my wife was asked if she could walk she cannot because of the pain in her knee eventually a wheelchair arrived terrible service by airasia
13919,lion air,7,avoid this seat on longer flights,denpasar to yogyakarta overall quite satisfied but seat comfort is the main issue i cant deny that i went for the cheapest tickets online booking was easy online checkin opens 24 hours before the flight and i was able to already select seats for free which was nice checkin and baggage dropoff at denpasar bali airport was quick we booked 15kg of baggage one bag was slightly overweight and i didnt bother too much beforehand the employee weighed the two bags together and it said 292kg so no problem at all i printed online boarding passes but we got new ones at baggage dropoff flight boarded nicely on time about 10 oclock before the 1025 departure time pushback was at about 1030 and takeoff just shortly thereafter according to schedule flighttime would be only 55 minutes and landing would be at 1020 java time is one hour before bali but we landed at about 1040 taxi took only a minute and 1050 we were waiting inside on our luggage that took about 15 minutes to appear on the belt maybe a little long the flight itself was boring there is no service available flight attendants seemed professional though the seat was the main letdown a little filthy and legroom insufficient should have been the same 29 inch pitch as on airasia but felt tighter couldnt keep my legs straight with my 192m and had to bend them because of the short flight it was doable but i would try to avoid this seat on longer flights i would fly lion air again on short flights our flight operated nicely on time but i hear that can also be an issue
14734,meridiana,9,meridiana customer review,lgwflr trip planes on time friendly cabin crew free snack and drink seats bigger and more legroom than low cost airlines easy and cheap bus connection to and from florence centre all in all a great experience
21740,vietnam airlines,6,unsmiling cabin crew,sydney to ho chi minh city it seems a shame that vietnam airlines continues to shoot itself in the foot instead of improving my trip from sydney to ho chi minh city was afflicted by the same problems as in past 6 years the safety announcement prior to take off was almost inaudible and beyond comprehension i brought this to the attention of the senior cabin attendant in economy who didnt seem concerned even the video presentation had errors with the actor in the lifevest demonstration blowing across the inflation tubes not into them the food served about an hour after departure was okay not special soon after the trays were cleared away we entered an area of quite strong turbulence the seat belt sign was illuminated and an almost inaudible message alerted passengers but then the sign stayed on for almost 3 hours after the turbulence had ceased naturally passengers ignored the sign and went about the cabin and to the toilets with no concern from the cabin attendants as has been the case for years the inflight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired especially when compared to similar carriers choices are extremely limited while the secondary control on the top of the seat armrest repeatedly changes the volume turns your reading light on or calls the cabin attendant if your rest your arm on it a serious design error approved by vietnam airlines the prelanding snack was a beef pie mine was cold and i asked the senior attendant for a hot one she said nothing took the tray and disappeared soon after the food server in the other aisle saw that i had no meal and gave me a hot pie after another 5 minutes the senior came back with my original pie is this the best vna can do with cabin service oh and like every vna flight ive taken in the past 6 years the unsmiling cabin crew seem to regard their job as boring and a grudging effort vna has the potential to be among the top international carriers in the world but it will take a total attitude turnaround of senior management to achieve this
20355,thomas cook airlines,3,too uncomfortable to recommend,grim seating nice staff i didnt realise that the premium cabin has no additional legroom it was just so uncomfortable for me as a person of 6ft 4 ins a friend booked us on this flight as we were going as a group so i didnt get the chance to check on the legroom beforehand the staff seemed nice and professional though sorry just too uncomfortable for me to be able to recommend if you are in the first row there is a bulkhead so nowhere at all to stretch out your legs not even under a seat
16249,porter airlines,4,customer service was of no help,save yourself fly any other airline our porter airlines flight from montreal to toronto was diverted to sudbury we waited in a small holding area for hours no food and limited bathroom usage not enough seats for half the people crammed in the space we were boarded and flown back to toronto only to have our flight to chicago cancelled this was 1231 we were rebooked for 15 we both work and have kids at home so there was no way we were able to spend an additional 5 days in toronto customer service was of no help we ended up purchasing tickets on a different airline to get home i would never use this airline again under any circumstance
12844,klm royal dutch airlines,8,staggeringly poor baggage handling,they lost the bags of the couple we were meeting took 2 days to get them their bags they lost about 50 bags out of the 200 people on our flight they lost my bag took 3 days to get it to me they lost my husbands bag took 4 days to get it to him meanwhile we are well into a serengeti safari with no gear then they lost one of the two bags of the couple we were traveling with on the way back they were going to sfo we went to lax not the fault of the crew in killy by the way the bags didnt make it through amsterdam staggeringly poor baggage handling couldnt tell us where the bags were couldnt say when or how they would get them to us
7439,condor airlines,2,i will not ever fly them again,i flew on condor several times when lufthansa owned it and was delighted they have since been sold to thomas cook and the experience was very poor for my flight from las to muc the seats are miserable there is so little leg room and im only about 58 i have never been on such a pitiful long haul flightand it is not inexpensive they charge for moviesreally and the change of planes in fra was a complete disaster no announcements or signage and no one knew we had to check in again or where to do so everyone was confused and angry i will not ever fly them again
20927,transavia,5,no sandwiches available,faro to eindhoven left about half an hour late due to an oil spillage on the runway not a fault of the airline new aircraft with modern sky interior very tight and rockhard seating which led to an uncomfortable flight and back pain table was filthy completely covered in coffee stains on the front and back asked the steward for a wet cloth and cleaned it ourselves flight departed at 1830 no sandwiches whatsoever available the plane had already made a return flight that day and catering was apparently not replenished also warm cheese sandwiches were sold out so very little food items to choose from which is unexceptable crew advised the passengers to send a complaint to customer services perhaps transavia can also think of adding or changing their catering assortment onboard beacuse it has been more or less the same especially the sandwiches for at least the past 10 years a warm meal like other lccs or even tui offer for purchase could be an idea also considering transvia flies to far away destinations like dubai cabin crew were friendly and flight calm and uneventful but transavia could make some effort in providing a better onboard experience
11548,interjet,1,cannot be trusted,el salvador to mexico city i flew with interjet a week ago i had some luggage vandalised and destroyed with a sharp object i reported the incident immediately at airport a report was taken when i contacted staff of interjet not a single person wanted to help on the phone they hung up at the airport they sent me to another city to report on email they only say automated polite response they stop responding and never helped this is the worst airline no customer service no support do not fly with them worst experience the flights were cancelled they had no airplane for us had to wait an entire day cannot be trusted
20348,thomas cook airlines,1,appalling customer service,dont even bother booking a thomas cook airlines flight it was the worst experience ever we paid 130 for 2x65 seat upgrades for extra legroom only to be told 30mins before boarding that they had double booked our seats and we were being moved to normal seats the only way to get a refund was to wait until getting back to uk and put in a complaint form online and wait 28 days even then after phoning them they insisted that they never received my complaint absolutely appalling customer service with no concern for its customers we will never fly again with thomas cook also on our outbound trio my inflight entertainment didnt work and it meant having no entertainment for a 10 hour flight plus when we got back to manchester our suitcase was damaged beyond repair
15423,olympic air,8,olympic air customer review,cdgath a320 welcomed by a friendly crew seats quite comfortable i was sitting one row behind the emergency exit and the cabin crew came to brief the passengers about the operation of the doors in case of emergency started service with drinks and then a hot meal after that more drinks as well as coffee or tea along with a box of chocolate cookies overall good service smiling crew and good value for money bearing in mind i booked the ticket a few days ago and the plane was nearly full still room for improvement though as there is still no in flight entertainment or a good magazine to keep the passengers busy
22783,wizz air,5,definitely not the worst low cost,when i was preparing our trip to the uae i read a lot of reviews about wizz air unfortunately there are no other lowcost airlines flying from yerevan at least other flights are much more expensive i hated wizz air in advance and expected worse i have installed wizz mobile app and i couldnt check in i was getting error something went wrong but i successfully checked in on the wizz site i checked in one person for free got the free random place and i checked second person my wife purchased next to my place for 11 euro this way you can have places near not for twice price we traveled with 1 year child we got 3 cabin baggage places 40x30x20 up to 10kg each included plus stroller for free i have to say that was enough for us we printed boarding cards not boarding passes because airline can take money if you dont have them the experience starting from the airport was fine good people good service comfortable plane food is not included in the ticket definitely not the worst low cost
3907,alitalia,4,rude staff and terrible customer service,we flew from brindisi to rome service was trash everyone there is on a power trip no customer service skills at all very rude then rome to ny the flight was fine but they didnt pay delta for our connecting flight to atlanta delta found our name in the system but said the spots were only reserved and basically alitalia owed them money to actually book the flight we didnt find this out till we got to ny because none of the service desksppl at the gate were able to print us our ticket in rome or brindisi and didnt say why so we get to ny find this out and end up missing our flight were still on the phone with the airline on hold to get this sorted out im very disappointed with my overall experience with this airline unreliable airline and rude people working for them these are only the issues we had on the way back home to atl we had issues otw to rome too again rude staff and terrible customer service
13148,kuwait airways,9,a good experience,colombo to jeddah via kuwait it was on time cabin crew is friendly and responsive kwi to cmb my screen was not functioning better to add some new good films to the system overall it was a good experience
22134,vivaaerobs,8,our experience went better than expected,i was a bit sceptical to purchase tickets based on reviews but our experience went better than expected i decided to leave a review because it seems like people only review when things go bad we had a flight from nyc to cdmx and then to oaxaca and both flights were ontime and smooth checkin was smooth and checked luggage was received quickly the cabin crew staff were very nice also we enjoyed our flight obviously you pay for what you get the seats dont recline theyre not as cushioned as other airlines and you have to pay for food and drinks my partner and i were aware of this so we prepared accordingly if youre looking for an airline to get you to point a to point b safely then viva is your goto if your looking for more comfort then go with another airline
20306,thomas cook airlines,6,flight was okay,gatwick to heraklion mt 1178 6th september 2019 left a little late but it made up some timethe meal which i had prepaid for arrived almost three hours into the flight no water was offered or wine just a weak flavoured tea which didnt really quench my thirst this was very disappointing i expected more the aircraft seemed very cramped inside the take off message during the safety demonstration was very mumbled the flight was ok it would have been nice if the flight destination screens had been switched on once through passport control and having collected my case there was a row of coaches outside the terminal and even at 10pm the place was very busy on return arrived at heraklion airport packed with people no where to sit as we waited for a delayed flight back to gatwick this time the flight destination screens were switched on and off in between an old episode of an american sitcom i had to ask when the food was coming as it had been several hours since my last meal again no water or wine was offered only another cup of flavourless tea it seemed that duty free sales came first the flight was okay
19313,sunwing airlines,6,plane was clean in both flights,flew yyzcun and cunyyz with sunwing as a part of a work trip the aircraft was a 16 year old boeing 737 for both flights oktvy yyzcun couldnt check in online so had to wait in line for around 45 minutes at yyz i was asked whether i wanted an aisle or a window seat boarding was fine pushback was around 15 minutes late but we landed on time we were served teacoffee twice during the 4 hour flight not too much legroom but not bad cunyyz also couldnt check in online waited for around 1 hour at cun i wasnt asked this time if i wanted an aisle or a window seat and i was randomly given 32e last row middle seat pushed back on time landed a couple of minutes early was served teacoffee twice during the 3 hour 20 minute flight my seat obviously didnt recline but the legroom was enough plane was clean in both flights
5260,bahamasair,1,bahamasair customer review,my girlfriend and i flew round trip from nassau to cuba our return home was delayed for three days due to incompetence and failure to follow up on promises on the way back the flight was oversold and we were bumped off in havana there was no call for volunteers and no consideration of priority for those with connecting flights in nassau or nowhere else to go in havana according to local staff this had never happened before and they were completely unprepared to deal with it they were eventually coaxed into arranging a hotel and were great about it very embarrassed that it had happened etc it still took around five hours of messing about in the airport however we had very little cash left because we thought we were about to leave and as us credit cards dont work in cuba we were pretty much stuck and were not even able to contact the other airline that was getting us home from nassau a vp from bahamasair got involved he told us to ask for him when we got to nassau and he would sort everything out when we got there he was unavailable and neither he nor anyone else had done anything at all as a result we wasted most of the day in nassau airport then got stuck for another night in miami before finally making it home 3 days late to add insult to injury the complaint process is absurd after more than four months bahamasair eventually offered us a pittance for compensation in travel vouchers which i am unlikely to use as i will not subject myself to their appalling service again 110 rating may seem harsh as they did provide us with accommodation and limited meals for part of our delay also the people we actually dealt with facetoface were great however the utterly incompetent way they handled everything pretty much trumps any positive aspects
11054,hong kong airlines,8,it got me to where i want,beijing to hong kong return with hong kong airlines the first flight was an older model without ife the second flight was on a much newer and more comfortable plane with ife usual meals and bathroom facilities happy with ground crew she was able to send my luggage all the way to my final destination on a different airline and ticket budget airline and fare it got me to where i want over the chinese new year festival
21869,virgin australia,6,staff very friendly and helpful,check in was easy staff were very friendly and helpful the only drink available was water which was no big deal given it was such a short flight snacks were available for purchase unfortunately the flight was delayed for 40 minutes
15329,okay airways,4,okay airways customer review,second trip with okay airways this time from dalian to yantai in a ma60 a chinese turboprop that seats about 50 passengers with 22 abreast seating flight takes only about 40 minutes in the air price was pretty reasonable given the length of the flight and that flying a chinesemade aircraft means no taxes seats bit cramped i had to stretch my legs in the aisle no screens of any kind just magazines in the seat pocket acceptable for a regional flight but that does not mean that there should be chewing gum gluing the pages together nothing to eat or drink no bottled water no bags of nuts the only flight attendant was invisible through out the flight arrived on time overall not a pleasant experience
13158,kuwait airways,7,experience was very good,kuwait to kochi the aircraft was not too old or may be a new one the flight departed on time from the kuwait airways dedicated new terminal no 4 cabin crew was very attentive food beverage good in business class the seat was not flat bed overall flight experience was very good but the ground services was very poor
7704,croatia airlines,7,croatia airlines customer review,flew zagreb frankfurt return check in was fast and smooth outbound flight on a320 very clean aircraft staff were great very friendly and attentive to all passengers there was no inflight entertainment at all just a few screens with commercials generally good service for 15 hour flight
905,air astana,5,good service and great tasting food,almaty to kuala lumpur my final destination was jakarta but air astana could only check in my luggage until kuala lumpur as there was no facility to check in to another airline the flight was delayed more than 3 hours from almaty original departure time was 1130pm it was not until 250am we boarded and left for kul during this time the flight time was changed at least 3 times from 1130pm 2am 230am and 240am there was no apology or information provided other than for technical reasons due to the delay i missed my connecting flight to jakarta the product flat bed is only 140 degree at the best it is an old style low bed where you almost sleep on the floor a 10 inch ipad was provided as an alternate to ptv the movie selections are limited and nothing to rave about the positive no crowd in business class great duvet and blankets good service and great tasting food
20328,thomas cook airlines,6,aircraft used is unsuitable,manchester to hurghada the aircraft used for this 5hr flight is in my opinion unsuitable the seats dont recline and are quiet hard no entertainment system or charging ports and its not like the lack of amenities are hugely reflected in the ticket price but the flight crew were very friendly and professional so not all bad
8079,dragonair,4,wont fly dragonair again,hanoi to hong kong with dragonair the flight eventually departed 3 hours late meaning we missed our connection to sydney arrival time was around 0110 and the transfer desk in hong kong was a complete shambles and we finally got our hotel voucher more than an hour later for a hotel 30 minutes away the queue for immigration was horrendous and we could see we would be very unlikely to get to the hotel before 3am since our rearranged flight was due to leave at 0910 we decided to stay in the plaza premium lounge airside all this could have been avoided if dragonair had been proactive in arranging accommodation in advance of our late arrival in hong kong they had enough time the aircraft flight and meal were reasonable though cabin service commenced very late in the flight i read that dragonair has one of the worst reputations for time keeping this may not be entirely its fault however lack of organisation was very apparent making this one of my worst flying experience in over 50 years wont fly dragonair again
7706,croatia airlines,6,croatia airlines customer review,lhrzaglhr tried checking in online and twice it crashed at heathrow i asked the check in agent for an empty row in economy as i had seen there were several he sort of grunted and sure enough i was sat in a row with another people so moved to an empty row once the doors closed not sure what the dish was it was a cold croatian pastry filled with cheese not really to my taste immigration in zagreb was disorganised with passengers queuing but those with transfer flights moving to the front so it felt like constantly moving backwards bags took a long time to come out despite the fact only a few passengers had checked in return journey was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to business class lounge was compact and the food available were peanuts cake and canap sized bread that was it the catfish with cold bean salad was again not to my taste in london immigration was quick but we did have to wait 30 minutes plus for our bags it will be interesting to see if croatian improve the offering on this route with a rival airline launching lhrzag flights from december
5051,avianca,3,uncomfortable and unbelievable experience,this was my first and hopefully last time flying with avianca first off they charge you for any and every snackbeverage inflight even water no matter how long the flight is one leg of our flight was about 6 hours they offer no complimentary refreshments secondly if legroom is a concern of yours i would aim for their highest level of seating which they refer to as premium these are the only seats besides the exit row seats with the most legroom on the plane even their plus seats dont have any extra legroom than economy has my boyfriend is 59 and his knees were uncomfortably touching the seat in front of him lastly on our final leg of the journey from bogota to jfk they made my boyfriend place his duffel bag in the personal item size guide at the gate when it wouldnt fit because something was slightly and i mean slightly because if he actually pushed down a bit on the bag it would have fit poking out they took us to a separate kiosk to try to make us pay 150 i ended up moving one of his items from his bag to my own and that made it fit to me it seemed like they wanted yet another way to make money that theyd charge 150 for a simple fix and if i hadnt moved his items they wouldve actually suckered us into paying it this was the most uncomfortable and unbelievable experience ive had with an airline so far definitely wont be doing it again
11384,icelandair,4,no food for cross atlantic flights,the staff at heathrow airport checkin take forever they try to deal with customers problems like they are a airline help deskassistance office instead of checking in passengers therefore what should be a relatively quick process through checkin takes between 3060 minutes in addition they provide no food for cross atlantic flights it is insane to think they expect passengers to go 8 hours without any food
2842,air seychelles,9,air seychelles customer review,in october this year i flew auhhkgauh hm86 and hm87 although slightly late leaving abu dhabi due to a catering issue the entire experience with air seychelles was brilliant although they were not particularly new a330200 aircrafts and the entertainment system a bit old and limited i found the cabin crew quite possibly the best in the business they were an energetic and enthusiastic crew working hard to give excellent customer service to passengers the flights were not full on either sector so having 2 seats to myself was great and comfortable after friendly chats about the airline with some of the crew in the galley i was brought champagne and chocolates to my seat a lovely gesture air seychelles was a stark contrast to their partner airline etihad
13324,lan airlines,8,lan airlines customer review,a lan airlines long haul flight from santiago to sydney via auckland that was surprisingly good once i worked out how to use flight entertainment it was easy seats were comfortable although somewhat squeezy food surprisingly good for airline food and real glass ceramic dish and metal cutlery were provided flight attendants were polite and helpful toilets were kept in check
9479,finnair,3,delayed but they didnt inform us,the airline staff in germany is very nice and helpful the flight was smooth and the food was good but the flight back to germany from bangkok is not ok the staff at bangkok suvarnabhumi airport are so not helpful and complaining about our heavy luggage in thai i am thai but my husband is german i could understand what they talked the flight was delayed but they didnt inform us the app from finnair was not updated for this delayed information the staff were busy charging us more money for our luggage all in all we would consider to take finnair again if there are no other options
7686,croatia airlines,7,croatia airlines customer review,30 min delay polite and attentive staff it seems that generally flights of this airline that are scheduled for the afternoon tend to be a bit delayed basic meal offered during this short flight with an option to top it up with purchased food and drinks flight about 70 full generally smooth service and no particular problems
1912,air india express,2,worst experience i ever had,dubai to thiruvananthapuram flight delay for 3 hour 30 mins no ac in flight for 2 hours everyone started using magazine for air food was worst and gave only snacks when someone paying 2000aed just to get snacks in flight no soft drinks or juices gave n0 blanket give to the customers worst experience i ever had

2821,air seychelles,2,its the worst service,johannesburg to seychelles on the 45 hour flight the cabin flight attendants made only one trolley run with food and drinks and that only after two hours in the air by contrast air namibia on a 15 hour flight do a drinks run a food run and still a coffee tea run afterwards during the flight kenya airways on a 4 hour run from johannesburg do several drink runs in addition to the food run during that time air seychelles cabin staff are not friendly and do not really care about the passengers its the worst service i have ever had on a flight

5292,bamboo airways,4,staff on board were pleasant but extremely untrained and disorganised,disorganised poorly trained staff tiny portions of food check in at hanoi staff member at check in desk was uninterested sending messages on his phone the whole time he was serving me didnt ask security questions didnt give me a chance to explain that the contents of my luggage were fragile and didnt even offer a choice of seat food only 2 very very small meals on a 13 hour flight no vegetarian option no options to choose meal before flight portions were small so an hour after eating i was starving i weigh 50kg and do not eat much other passengers felt the same and staff made pot noodles when requested so most the flight was engulfed in that nasty pot noodle smell dinner was served unannounced an hour and a half after take off and then nothing until breakfast an hour and a half before landing service staff on board were pleasant but extremely untrained and disorganised they asked a few passengers to put phones away for take off but rule seemed to be arbitrarily applied same with seats in upright position half the cabin got offered eye shades the other half didnt some passengers were clearly drunk and kept calling cabin crew who succumbed to their every demand at the expense and discomfort of other passengers a circusjoke luggage items in my suitcase were damaged on arrival positives new aircraft
20224,thai smile airways,6,luggage damaged three times in a row,ground service is okay cabin environment is okay crew attitude willing beverage and food normal the bad thing is delay of flight and the worst thing is about baggage service my luggage were damaged three times in a row
18840,spicejet,9,inflight experience is wonderful,ground staff and customer service staff are very helpful and supportive inflight experience is wonderful and spice max facilities are an added advantage thank you and keep up the good work
6882,china airlines,7,a350 was very comfortable,amsterdam to seoul via taipei the flight in the a350 from amsterdam to taipei was very comfortable especially the food and inflight entertainment made a good impression wifi was available however quite expensive the second flight from tpe to icn was in the boeing 747400 this plane felt quite old and the seats and inflight entertainment were obviously old
2135,air malta,4,extra legroom reservation was not respected,aircraft changes are normal these days flight experience ok nothing to say against it industry standard seat pitch inflight food and drinks very good fare but my emergency extra legroom reservation was not respected only the seat number i was asked if i have reserved 13d but they did not mention that this is no emergency row anymore so losing three of my points beside the badly trained checkin staff i do not understand why an airline with one airplane type is giving to some few planes other row numbers for emergency rows when selling them for higher fees
21982,vistara,2,experience was extremely disappointing,the worst airline i have ever flown with i booked and paid a premium for seating in row seven online check in allocated the three of us row 25 i emailed vistara three days prior to our departure explaining that when checking in online we had been allocated the incorrect seats no response was received airport check in staff either couldnt or wouldnt correct the obvious error and didnt seem care even though one person in our group had mobility issues there response was that they were only responsible for checking in and it wasnt their problem so now i have to fill out paperwork to claim a refund for the seating i booked and paid for which was allocated to someone else also the people in row 24 were totally ignorant of normal polite inflight protocol and reclined their seats which affected the person in our group with the mobility issue we asked them to be not recline their seats but all to no avail eventually after a vocal exchange with these people a flight attendant moved them to different seats the whole experience was extremely disappointing and very unprofessional
8628,el al israel airlines,3,enjoy being terrible people,flying with el al is unpleasant every time from preboarding to on flight service it is not about customer service it is about safety good thing but it doesnt mean you have to sacrifice being a nice person i choose el al because of the direct flights from los angeles i cannot stand the employees almost all are unpleasant to interact with they seem like they enjoy being terrible people
8110,dragonair,4,dragonair customer review,hkgpek in business two hour delay at hkg passengers have been told because late arrival of the aircraft but ka is based in hkg surely ka could reorganise the aircraft better business lounge the pier close to gate 64 is pretty average qantas business class is so much better boarding process was pretty average staff made announcement of boarding but did not board anyone until 15 minutes later inflight service was pretty bad for business class crew did not clean away the predeparture water glass and wet towel until dinner was served the cabin lights turned off before dinner items were cleaned it was bad service for a business class for any airline on a positive note ka finally has personal entertaining system in business class the seat is also better than the old one
13003,korean air,9,cabin staff attentive,incheon to london heathrow with korean air generally comfortable plane given im 193cm felt i had just enough leg room food was good with a choice between korean and plainer options cabin staff attentive polite and smiling throughout the flight was one of the best longhaul flights ive been on
2303,air mauritius,7,its fairly comfortable,mumbai to mauritius return with air mauritius somewhat dated aircraft with very sad ife the flights were on time seats were comfortable food was decent and they still hand out amenity kits not exactly fabulous but its fairly comfortable wouldnt mind flying with them again if they ramp up their frequencies up a bit
15993,philippine airlines,3,the seats were not layflat,in february 2023 my wife and i travelled roundtrip from san francisco to manila philippine airlines was the only nonstop option that we could find the flights and arrivaldeparture times were within reason airline personnel and their service was always very good we traveled on a b777300 which was fine but the business cabin was original the entertainment system appeared to have crt monitors built into the seats they worked about as well as 20 yearold crt screens not well movietvmusic selections were poor there was no lack of space not compartmentalized the seats were not layflat there was no stowage for blanketpillow apart from your lap or the floor in front of you one was viewing the monitor from a distance of about 45 feet generally it was not comfortable or what i would expect in 2023 the food would have been ok for premium economy the wine was generic and ok for no better than economy the lounges at sfo and manila were disappointing
12603,jetstar pacific,5,onboard staff courteous,website continuously timedout when making booking one occasion got right down to confirm flight then message appeared that the price has increased so had to start again not just confirm the increased price the increase was not much about 100000 vnd checkin process and staff member serving was excellent onboard staff courteous polite and speaks good english both at airport and on jetstar website lack of information about flight boardingtakeoff timings at han airport the departure info screens just gave us the details that were on our travel itinerary our flight was delayed 45 minutes airport flight departure screens or announcements did not tell us this we were queuing from 7pm for 725pm takeoff but boarding only commenced at 745pm for 815pm takeoff online departure times on jetstar website gave only the info provided on itinerary it was not updated to reflect delays onboard services generally good but lack choices for hot meals there are four options on the menu only one choice was available from the beginning the pork with rice
19496,swoop,1,yes believe the bad reviews,well i was warned yes believe the bad reviews our original flight out of abbotsford was supposed to be in after nine then they moved it to 105 pm i am literally sitting here now theyve now just delayed it again they said because they cant find the deicer truck or the driver to drive it nice these people have basically ruined my vacation i already had to change airlines on the way home because swoop could meet their criteria to pick us up do yourself a favour spend the extra money and go westjet andor any other airline do not i repeat do not let the cheapness of this airline fool you they will ruin your vacation
16813,rossiya airlines,2,totally not worth it,bangkok to moscow with rossiya airlines not the worst airline i flown with but far from good for the money they charge service shouldve been much better food was average seat comfort was none didnt get any sleep plane was packed overcrowded and even in these conditions the price for the ticket was outrageous because of that virus situation it was the only airline flying and they knew it so the price was unreasonable im pretty disappointed mostly because of how much money ive spent on this ticket totally not worth it
12870,klm royal dutch airlines,2,this was a first and not in a good way,this was a first and not in a good way i book my flights well in advance to get the seat i want like for a lot of people this is very important to me i especially wouldnt fly in a window seat long haul as it would be like being in prison so i booked the seat i wanted i looked a couple of days before the flight and it was still ok and checked in as soon as i could at the airport bangkok i checked in my luggage at the desk about 25 hours before the flight and was given a boarding pass still showing my choice of seat when they announced boarding about 40 mins before takeoff my boarding pass was refused and the klm staff said i had been kicked out of my seat for a family when the business section was full i had a look and there were no children so they must have called a family just a couple who couldnt be bothered to book their seats in advance this is the only time in doing this route for 33 years with various airlines that this has happened and even as a platinum member i will not put myself at risk of it happening again as it ruined the entire flight bye bye klm
2204,air malta,4,all in all a poor effort,london gatwick to malta with air malta what can i say but all in all a poor effort on all fronts delayed leaving the uk 30 minutes and seriously delayed leaving malta 7hrs having left the hotel at 630am to catch the 850am flight we missed our connecting flight home and had to book a a subsequent later flight at an additional cost to us they have a serious lack of communication albeit we got vouchers for food and drinks as always they will not comment on what exactly went wrong other than it went tech these things happen but it would be nice to inform you as soon as possible and then keep you updated and just do it as required according to the eu rules and flight delays even when we were told the flight would be leaving at 3pm that did not happen the plane itself looked tired it been through a lot the seating cramped when compared to our island carrier aurigny and their embraer e195 a regional carrier how is this possible also upon vacating the seat i noted how the cushioning remained depressed obviously a well used seat generally the interior of the plane although clean it too looked dated the lack of inflight entertainment is a poor effort the food poor effort once again a filled bread roll and a bottle of water i would rather not bother in fact i didnt when you consider aurginy you will have at least a choice of soft drinksteacoffee and of course water this is certainly not a experience i wish to repeat it ruined a perfectly good holiday ultimately if we ever returned to malta i will ensure my family and i choose an alternative carrier
1866,air india,7,food was improved,have not travelled with this airline since 2016 but this time the crew and food was improved we had 3 flights with them cochin to mumbai mumbai to aurangabad return to mumbai
20337,thomas cook airlines,7,seats extremely uncomfortable,manchester to los angeles we flew premium outbound and economy inbound as no premium seats available premium ok for what we paid and tolerable for 11 hour flight economy seats extremely uncomfortable despite having exit seats dont recline narrow and not tall enough for tall people on both legs food portions and type were inadequate for the length of the journey we were hungry not enough drinks service lights are put out and youre encouraged to sleep only pro is cost in comparison to other airlines direct flight and on time staff were fine
17893,shanghai airlines,4,shanghai airlines customer review,july 2012 shanghai to melbourne business class overall the flight was good but the attention to takeoff and landing procedures was appalling we had many people using ipads and other devises while takeoff and landing luggage on the floor that should have been in a locker again during takeoff there was absolutely no inflight entertainment and the seats were old and even though they reclined back the leg rest was uncomfortable we were offered drinks with a meal but no more the planes were old and very tired when i asked about an express customs card they had absolutely idea of what i was talking about as some of the staff really struggled with english
17304,ryanair,6,pleasant flight for a decent fare,a pleasant flight for a decent fare and on time leg space remains a problem cabin crew were attentive and cheerful what i appreciate most with them is that they try to achieve boarding and leaving the aircraft swiftly as they are always on a rushed schedule
1625,air europa,4,would not recommend the airline,the flight itself was okay regarding plane and onboard entertainment as well as punctuality however leg room is very little and the on board service is an very disappointing for an 11hr flight everything extra except for one meal no choice and water flight attendants also are not necessarily very nice ground service is the worst i have seen you are randomly assigned a seat even if you fly as a couple that booked together there is no way to change this online checkin in advance was not possible would not recommend the airline again their advantage however is clearly the price
13560,latam airlines,4,not good at all,london to santiago via madrid we flew with latam from london to chile and back and also took several flights within chile on the plus side the crew were all friendly and efficient like many airlines the food and drink service is minimal now so it feels like a low cost airline the ticketing website and associated online services are a shambles and the whole system needs a thorough upgrade we werent able to check in online for any of our 9 flights despite the system recognising the booking reference and our name it just kept generating spurious and meaningless error messages and suggesting we try again later not good at all
9984,flysafair,1,staff on board was rude,first of all the front desk ladies were very sweet and helpful i can not complain about them now lets start the staff on board were rude and did not seem bothered with the clients at all after the safety instructions were done they simply went and buckled themselves in not one of them came by and checked to see if any of the passengers were buckled in when we arrived my sons car seat was booked in as special baggage well thank you for breaking the chair into two pieces the car seat was thrown on the floor in the middle of the conveyors where you collect your bags we asked the people at the kiosk where we should collect the special baggage they simply pointed to stuff thrown on the floor and there was where my sons car seat was thrown when we flew with mango on the 4th they brought my sons car seat to us to the kiosk on a trolley as it should be but to throw someones baggage like it garbage is disgusting staff have no personality no drive and no respect for your clients goods when we flew with mango again on the 4th of feb the pilots were excellent they kept telling us and informing us where we were but the pilots of flysafair did none of that i regret not flying with mango again and regret that i used your services i will never be you client again and i advise anyone not to make use of your services
6624,cathay pacific airways,9,experience was very pleasant,the flight experience was very pleasant the online checkin process was simple the flight attendants are all polite hardworking and well mannered the food is pretty good it doesnt have a large selection but the quality is good the food is warm enough the dinner roll is warm and soft theres fresh fruit and ice cream too this is instrumental to a long flight 14 hours as you dont want to feel stuffed but refreshed and hydrated the flight is clean and seats feel very new not sure if they did any renovation during the pandemic the ground service of cx at the logan airport is great i need to take the second flight and basically had no ideas on what to do with my baggage the ground service there told me where to go where to claim my baggage and where to drop off and check in again one improvement i would make is on the movietv selection
7823,csa czech airlines,4,expensive with poor conditions,flew bucharest to prague expensive with poor conditions i traveled better with ryanair and it was also cheaper like a quarter of the price here with luggage included and so on tarom was also at a better price and with better conditions czech airlines do not offer you the minimum seat space not a good food service and also the baggage requirements are very annoying
9704,flyadeal,5,prices are quite unreasonably high,flew on a routine domestic service from jeddah to riyadh the aircraft was ok for the 1 hour flight i had paid for meals and water which i never received so im quite disappointed legroom was quite bad and the seat wasnt uncomfortable but i cant complain much for the 1 hr flight i have to say the prices are quite unreasonably high
5160,ba cityflyer,8,excellent airline,due to my work i was required to travel to london however as no airline offered cheap prices on such short notice i decided to travel with ba cityflyer from rotterdam to london city traveling to rotterdam the haque airport is pretty doable by public transport from rotterdam central station or the hague central station by bus andor underground once arrived i went straight to checkin my luggage which was fast and efficient as there was literally no queuing time after passing the usual struggle at security i had a hour left before boarding starts due to work in progress on rotterdams terminal there wasnt much to do wifi was fast and constant though with lots of seating areas boarding was done in a nice and efficient way however what do you expect of only boarding approximately thirty people the cabin was comfortable plenty of legroom leather seats and a good view in front of the wing however id like to note that it would have been better if they actually replaced their magazine and safety card by a new one as the current one was in a very very poor state departed on time it was a pretty short and straight leg with the pilot informing us several times with departure arrival and weather information and 15 minutes into flight the flight attendants served us a pretty limited service for british airways terms might had to do with a short flight of only 55 minutes which included a drink of choice and a biscuit or chips once arrived with a not so smooth landing the plane was quickly parked and deboarding started within a few minutes walk to customs in peak this is terrible and baggage dropoff was just a few minutes ba cityflyer is an excellent airline providing you with plenty of legroom and friendly staff however i still found it very pricey and catering could have been improved
21732,vietnam airlines,6,i think it is worth the money,melbourne to ho chi minh city ground service depends which airport your in with melbourne its just average with ho chi minh it could be really slow or really fast i think it is worth the money because when i looked it was about the 2nd cheapest airline and with my point of view that is were it should be seat was pretty comfortable for a domestic and 12 hour flight i wouldnt recommend for any longer flight the food was okay but only had a very small choice for my flight only fish and fried noodles but they had a large variety of drinks the inflight entertainment the screen was only touch screen and they only had wifi connectivity on the new aircraft
20698,tigerair australia,1,do not purchase the insurance,sydney to gold coast do not purchase the insurance with chubb insurance the recommended insurer by tiger i have had the worst experience after 9 months of being asked for more details receipts not efficient enough type them out send airline report again and long delays has been the worst experience and obvious that the company has been trying to avoid or find an error which has meant they do not have to pay i advice getting insurance elsewhere
6266,bulgaria air,6,there is no reason to choose this airline,flew bulgaria air from tel aviv to varna and return 4 hours delay every hour they updated with another delay old aircraft and bad service once we arrived to the aircraft we spent another 30 minutes without air conditioning unless the price is very low comparing the rest there is no reason to choose this airline
16991,royal brunei airlines,6,ability to provide better,on my first leg from bandar seri begawan to singapore on a new a320neo aircraft the cabin was very fresh and clean the flight leave on time with no issue but the ife was not working shortly after take off the ife was not working i tried to inform the crew about it but the senior crew was busy chatting with the crew in the back galley 30 minutes later i told one of the crew about the ife he said he will inform his superior on my way back from jakarta to bwn a new a320neo once again everything seems good about the cabin the ife was working before the aircraft push back from the stand in cgk took a little time to browse the ife i fly with rb every month since july the tv guide and other movie list channel has never been change or refresh the movies and tv channel were very out dated and its getting bored to watch the same film or tv program again and again i finally get the chance to select a movie and the flight into an hour later the ife restart itself i think this airlines has the ability to provide better products and the services including the crew dealing with problems need more training in customer service
17029,royal brunei airlines,7,not a premium service,london to brunei via dubai with royal brunei airlines cabin half empty row 11 has no windows adjacent to seat which requires passengers sitting in 11a and 11k to lean forward to see outside the window despite half empty cabin one of the three main menu options were not available as airline is a dry carrier only basic fruit juices fizzy drinks and hot beverages are served cabin crew polite and efficient but not a premium service complimentary goody bag is a joke when compared to most other carriers crew change in dubai and next sector to bandar seri begawan only had four pax in the cabin both service and food on offer much better on this sector seat and flat bed comfortable ife choices are limited and seat configuration 2x2x2 is not ideal for long sectors toilets clean the product difference between royal brunei and a premium carrier such as qatar airways is substantial paying the additional premium in order to get a much superior product and service delivery may well be justified
16384,qantas airways,3,very disappointed in qantas,this was my worst travel experience with qantas i flew with them before but their quality seems to be going downhill i flew to singapore via brisbane i was only informed at the airport that my flight from brisbane to singapore was delayed 8hours no prior notification received through email or even their own app whatsoever when i landed in brisbane at least they could have given me vouchers or something or access to their airport lounge for such a long delay very disappointed in qantas
6517,cathay dragon,9,an excellent flight,hong kong to kolkata an excellent flight where i was doted on by two very amiable and helpful cabin crew members it helped that i was one of just two passengers in the business class section which had 8 seats in two rows of 2x2 a menu card was provided and my selection was tasty and filling a good complement of drinks and spirits was on offer however they have not changed their dessert a small cup of haagen daz ice cream in at least 7 years it is always served solid frozen i passed on it and had some port wine instead the flight departed on time from a satellite terminal which was reached by a short bus ride from the main terminal arrival was on schedule indian government landing cards required of foreigners were provided on board the seats are traditional business class recliners and were reasonably comfortable boarding was smooth intermixed with main cabin travelers through a jet way ipads with a small selection of films and shows were provided soon after take off it was difficult to slot them into the metal clasps on the back of the seat in front of you you needed to hold on to the ipad to watch your program magazines and newspapers on offer lots of storage space overhead leg space could be a tad extra once you recline fully your toes juts on the bottom of the front seat announcements were made in clear english and for a very thoughtful touch also in bengali the language of the destination city cathay dragon had a duty free catalog and three of my four selections were available for purchase this is one aspect of travel i very much enjoy as it lets me pick up last minute gifts
8704,emirates,9,checkin was easy,mauritius to dubai checkin was easy and also enjoyed priority immigration and security emirates uses the air mauritius lounge and the lounge offered better than expected services inflight the flight attendants seemed to treat passengers with genuine hospitality for the first time felt that the bar at the back of business class cabin was a good place to relax the food was great and good wine selections the business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people including myself and the inflight internet offering is far from satisfactory inflight internet could be purchased at 1699 for a 6hour flight excluding takeoff and landing the internet would only be provided for 4 hours at most and streaming would still be blocked
25,adria airways,5,value for money is not there nor the experience,fly only if no other connection i am a frequent business flyer mostly departing from vienna or munich to destinations the flight with adria was chosen due to convenience however if i had an option to choose next time the value for money is not there nor the experience outdated aircraft buzzing from ac in the upper compartment present the whole time of descending and extremly anoying complimentary glass of water and snack pretzles other options only upon payment does not seem acceptable fot the price over 400 eur not to mention online check in unavailable from paris while the traffic to the airport is unpredictable hence online check in is a must all in all i would fly adria again only if there is no other option left the aircraft staff though very nice
18079,silkair,9,inflight services were very good,surabaya to singapore return it was our first time flying silkairs newest boeing 737800 this new aircraft has sky interior design which is very beautiful and relaxing our flight to surabaya tookoff on time and landed ahead of schedule by 10 minutes the ground staff at changi international airport was very helpful when she gave us assistance to use the self checkin kiosk for the first time it was quite simple to use after a few clicks you can print out your boarding pass as well as your luggage tag then you can proceed to the checkin counter to drop your luggage however we had a minor problem when we dropped our bags at the checkin counter an agent told us only two out of three bags were registered then that agent helped us to recheckin our three bags altogether the inflight services were very good and the meals had nice taste once we landed at juanda international airport there was another minor problem with the baggage delivery we were told our baggage would be delivered from carousel number 4 and waited for about 10 minutes before it then moved to carousel number 3 again it took ages to get our bags delivered there were approximately 1015 minutes intervals to collect all the three luggage it was not silk airs fault but the delivery system at juanda which needs to be sorted out
1554,air dolomiti,5,air dolomiti customer review,recently i experienced my first flight with air dolomiti and first time on an embraer from frankfurt to verona the boarding was punctual embraer is a nice plane and i enjoyed the fact that the seats are 2 by 2 only the service onboard very professional it was a flawless flight
3099,air zimbabwe,6,communication wasnt great,when we purchased our ticket online we were not informed that we would be flying direct from victoria falls to johannesburg however it was explained to us at airport checkin that the flight was was victoria falls bulawayo joburg the flight was delayed about 30 minutes in vic falls and we deplaned when we arrived at bulawayo airport and eventually reboarded a larger plane communication wasnt great but we spoke with another passenger who took this flight more regularly and this was apparently the norm aside from the fact that it was free seat meaning pick any available seat regardless of what was indicated on boarding pass the flight went well i would not recommend this flight if you have a tight connection it would be wise to leave yourself sufficient room for delays most countries charge a departure tax when leaving by air often the tax is automatically added to the airline ticket price but not always as is the case with air zimbabwe so be prepared to pay 50usd cash before going through security
15293,norwegian,3,unpleasant experience,paris to oakland we arrived paris cdg checkin counter more than 3 hours before our flight despite this we almost didnt make it norwegian had scheduled 3 longhaul flights very close to each other as they dont have online checkin option and there was only one line it took more than half an hour to make it to the checkin kiosk there were 2 attendants milling about to help folks at the kiosks it was not clear if we could walk to the boarding gate right after getting our boarding passes it was also not clear if there was a bag drop counter separate from people having other ticketing issues norwegian didnt post instructions to direct people whatsoever nonetheless we went to counter to see if it was possible for us to sit together on an 11hour flight instead we were interrogated by a sourfaced counter attendant first she wanted to see my companions onward flight out of the us my companion showed her the expedia ticket from her phone the norwegian attendant acted like it was a fake ticket she couldnt locate the flight number from the ticket confirmation so my companion pulled out her laptop to show the same expedia confirmation on a bigger screen the attendant still couldnt locate the flight number accusing her that there wasnt any flight number on the expedia confirmation does this person work for an airline how is it that she cant even find a flight number on ticket confirmation after wrangling between the info on the phone and the laptop for over 10 mins i finally located the onward flight number for her 2 now about the bags i had paid for one 20kg checked bag turned out it was about 2 kg under the limit the norwegian attendant looked over at our backpacks and carryons she proceeded to weigh every bag we were bringing onto the flight there was no mistake that she was trying to find fault we ended up being about 4 kg over between the two of us amongst this excess weight were some apples sandwiches snack bars and bottled water she held on to our passports and tickets and sent us away to figure out how to redistribute all the stuff in our packed bags we ended up eating some of our apples and drinking our water while putting on extra clothes to lighten the combined weight sure thing that norwegian attendant played by the book she didnt do anything wrong but we were scrutinized like we were criminals the unpleasant experience continued at cdg airport though it wasnt norwegians fault there were only two officers at passport control to stamp every outgoing noneu persons passport by the time i arrived at the noneu line it looked like there were people from 6 longhaul flights lined up at some point only one immigrant officer was left stamping passports i was in line for an hour and a half having already wasted almost an hour and a half at the norwegian checkin counter i made it to the gate only just in time even though we got there more than 3 hours before flight departure the only points i am giving to this review had to do with the uneventful onflight experience it wasnt unpleasant and that says a lot to compensate for a very weak checkin experience in cdg
1112,air burkina,4,aircraft was in terrible shape,i was booked to fly non stop from abidjan to ouagadougou burkina faso with air burkina their website was surprisingly easy to maneuver and in a few minutes my etkt was issued i guess i was smart to ask the concierge at my hotel in abidjan to confirm my flight the day beforeair burkina had my emailbut no notices whatsoever re the dramatic changeto my unpleasant surprise he was told my flight was cancelled and i was rebooked on a different flight at 0800 rather than 1115 i was at the check in counters at 0600 per the instructions of the reservation office in abidjan im sure the concierge understood well the new information he received from air burkinas office to my unpleasant surprise i was refused to be checked in and was told to wait as there is a problem with my ticket i waited patiently till all passengers were checked in and then i was told by hand signs no english spoken by the check in supervisor that the flight is full and to go and see the agents at air burkinas office in the terminal there i was told by an agent that im booked on a different flight at 3pm i insisted that i had a seat on the early morning flight as i trusted the information i got from the hotel in the city i was promised i had a seat at 3pmbut already i had my doubts at that point i asked why they didnt accept me on the 0800 flight as they cancelled my original flight and even if i had no reservation per their version i thought i was entitled to standby for the morning flight no was the answer reason the flight was stopping in accra where it was going to be filled up 100 i told the agents that i thank them for their efforts and i am not going to wait 8 hours at the airport for maybe flying at 3pm i left their office trying to figure out a way out of ivory coast as i had a business class ticket on ethiopian from ouagadougou to addis ababa and hoped ethiopian airlines would reissue my ticket to fly from abidjan to addis suddenly i was approached by the air burkina agent who offered me to pay penalty for a flight change from 3pm to 8 am of 50euro i had to pay air burkina 50 euro because they cancelled my flight amazing the 100 full flight from accra excuse was no longer an issue i decided to pay despite the convoluted business conduct of air burkina so i dont miss my visit to burkina faso for 50 euro i paid and quickly was rushed to the aircraft out of accra there were at least 20 empty seats and business class was 100 empty so much for correct information the aircraft was an ex lot airliner in terrible shape torn seats dirty cabin toilets without toilet paper drinks were served from abidjan to accras 30 minute flightand a hot tasty meal was offered on the 1 hour flight from accra to ouagadougou quite impressive service what a poor show of caring for customers at abidjan airport and their website says that the customer is at the center of all they do really

6991,china eastern airlines,6,an enjoyable experience,melbourne to london via shanghai customer service both customer service office in melbourne and sydney office were very helpful please note that the melbourne office is only contactable by email never answers the phone if you want to speak to someone call the sydney office crew very professional in all flights thank you to them for making our flight an enjoyable experience time keeping all four were flights arrived on time very unusual in my experience pvg terminal 1 departurestransit depending on your ticket class the airline offers a dining voucher selected places when having a long stop over in pvg 80rmbpp this is enough to get you a decent bowl of noodles each at hope star coffee cafe the info is on their website but difficult to find see below for more transiting info check in pvg many checkin desks open very quick and painless cons food poor even coming out of shanghai turbulence at the first sign of turbulence the seat belt sign lights up and then stays on for the entire flight this happened on all four flights everyone ends up ignoring it as a result website hard to navigate and makes many errors online check in pointless both in london and shanghai no bag drop for online check in only mel check in lhr very few check in desks open 1 hour to checkin boarding passes when checking in online it asks you to print your boarding passes no point as they print it for you at the airport our computer could not find the font to print the boarding passes another occasion the website did not recognise our checkin pvg terminal 1 arrivals cash machine did not work on our arrival if this is the case you need to walk to terminal 2 to withdraw cash pvg terminal 1 departurestransit shops are generally quite poor and expensive and so to are the nearly all the restaurants one cafe that stands out is hope star coffee cafe serves decent food nicely presented by far the best place to eat in terminal 1 there is also two starbucks one at each end of the terminal one has seats inside the other just takeaway depending on your ticket class or your time of stopover you could instead choose a maglev pass or a hotel room for a number of hours over the dining voucher but the airline said we could not leave the airport with a 7hr stopover when waiting to go through immigration and number of people we told they could not enter on their transit and we directed through to the transit area if youre looking to stopover for a couple of days you can get a 144hr visa on arrival at no charge this also allows you to visit selected provinces the bullet train makes it possible to do this we visited friends in nanjing on our return leg to shanghai the train took 1hr 11mins to travel 290km costing around 35aud one way

10951,hawaiian airlines,3,destroyed its customer service credibility,while staff are generally friendly on board hawaiian airlines flights customer service for anything not in person is unforgivingly terrible you will spend hours to get the most basic support like rescheduling a ticket there call center lines occasionally out source to some foreign countries with people who barely speak english and its very disappointing hawaiian for then last decade used to be my preferred airlines but with the death of island air and corporate greed caused by covid youre better off flying delta or southwest very disappointed with how this company has destroyed its customer service credibility over a few thousand dollars corporate greed at its finest

21601,uzbekistan airways,5,uzbekistan airways customer review,tashkent to nukus domestic was scared to board the old tu 154 seemed to be patched up on the outside no one seems to acknowledge seat allocation and i think i caused an onboard fight by making this woman move from my seat who yelled at me and then the woman in her seat who took it out on the person in her seat and so on but they did move wasnt that cheap considering the plane we were in couldnt relax until we arrived had some peanuts and flavoured water served to us seats folded down forwards when we got off the plane security guards in the baggage collection area checking our tickets when we collected our bags still it beats the 14 hours train ride when youre on a tight schedule
8014,delta air lines,2,complete lack of care for customers,delayed multiple times had myself wife and 7 year old was delayed due to not having a crew there to fly us home missed work had 5 hrs delay and delta only offered us 50 the meals alone were more than that will not be flying with them again after the way they treated us only communication is through email never can get anyone on the phone was told next time to go to red coats for meal voucher which we did and they said they will be issued at our home airport when we got there they knew nothing about what we were talking about complete lack of care for customers
2546,air new zealand,3,you may not receive a refund or hear anything,my recent flights with air new zealand for work and personal have been relatively easy service was good only slightly delayed the fares however vary enormously my advice is to book well ahead however this complaint is about a flight i did not take from christchurch to wellington on july 17 for work it was canceled at the last minute because of covid because my meeting was scheduled for that morning i could not take a later flight the service person at the airport was very helpful i later tried to claim a refund online for my seat reservations and advised of the cancelation the booking was done through my work which has also been trying to get in touch to claim the refund now i completely understand that air new zealand has been facing ongoing severe problems because of the pandemic but it would be good to get a refund or even to be able to contact the airline wait times for the call centre apparently are up to five hours i emailed them and received a reply one month after the cancelation to apologize for the delay since then neither myself or my workplace have heard anything a warning to passengers if your flight gets canceled through no fault of your own you may not receive a refund or hear anything this is deplorable air new zealand customer for 50 years

18363,sky airline,7,sky airline customer review,departure on time from santiago to punta arenas 2 stopovers are too many for such a flight in puerto montt and in balmaceda onboard service is fine we asked for a blanket without any problem food service ok snacks and beverage between each stopover cheep flights flight schedule respected i recommend it if you allow yourself an entire day to fly from santiago to punta arenas
3164,airasia,3,scalp you for every dollar,at every turn airasia try to scalp you for every dollar examples such as hoping you forget to checkin online so they can charge you additionally purposefully allocating seat locations if purchasing more than one ticket in different positions onboard so that youre more likely to pay the 600thb per person to change seats and waiting to tell you last minute your meal option has been discontinued so you have to pay more to get a different meal we expect more as consumers and preying on the technologically vulnerable is shameful behaviour
12436,jetstar asia,6,crew polite and helpful,jakarta to singapore with jetstar asia flight departed ahead of schedule crew polite and helpful unfortunately most seats didnt recline making sleep impossible on a middle of the night flight otherwise everything was ok

305,aeroflot russian airlines,2,the whole ticket was cancelled,i missed my flight due to a confusion with the flights in the airport moscow svo when two flights of aeroflot were scheduled to the same destination with a difference of approx 20 minutes but one of them was not shown on the departure board for some unknown reason as a result i missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight when i approached the customer desk in moscow with my issue of a missed flight i still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket they informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled it took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights how about the so called bonus miles program apparently its not even possible to spend them in any way if you havent reached 3000 miles so some of my flights with aeroflot were not even counted in the miles account even though i travel quite often is there a bug not counting the miles even when you enter the frequent flyer number
10955,hawaiian airlines,8,attendants were all very nice and cheerful,used hawaiian airlines for a day trip on tuesday 021522 from hnl to ogg to visit hubbys family there hawaiian airlines use all of terminal 1 in hnl airport announcements were made frequently regarding flight status and gate updates really good boarding is quite organized and people were called to board by zones the airplane for flight ha 216 was n488ha a 23 years old b712 we opted for the over wing emergency exit with extra legroom the seats are very standard plastic backed type and at the emergency exit the tray tables were located in the armrest however since the trip only takes minutes we dont really have the need for the tray table we only bring our backpacks for the flight and were able to put them under the seat in front of us the overhead bins are on the small side and based on its size can accommodate slimmer carryon only we depart around 15 minutes later than schedule which is a big deal for the 2030 minutes inter island flights like these however we land around 5 minutes ahead of schedule the flight attendants were all very nice and cheerful and within a short 2025 minutes flight were able to serve us drink water or a delicious pog juice cocktail passion fruitorangeguava and collect all the trash within minutes and we are ready for landing
16065,phuket air,2,phuket air customer review,my friend and i were on the 14th january flight from bangkok to gatwick when the engine caught fire and we had to land back at bangkok what a total nightmare i would urge anyone thinking of using phuket airlines to go with a reputable carrier and to avoid flying with them phuket airlines in my opinion are a total shambles once we had landed back at bangkok airport there was no organisation no explanations just total chaos none of the staff had a clue what was going on and how to handle the situation we heard stories from other passengers about problems they had experienced on the way out as well mechanical problems very long delays etc they are just not equiped to deal with big international flights the reason they are so cheap is because they are so crap the planes are very old and have definitely seen better days dont risk it pay the extra to fly with a decent airline is my advice you will feel safer and more confident and you will get much better service we spent out 400 on a new return ticket as we were not prepared to fly back with them to london the following day 13 hours is a long time to sit and worry whether their old plane will make it or not i know alot of other people on our original flight bought new tickets as well some were on our thai airways flight back to heathrow my friend has since contacted phuket airlines here in the uk to take the matter further but surprisingly they arent being very helpful phuket airlines bunch of cowboys in my opinion

18927,spicejet,1,too many flight delays cancellations,flight sg3024 the flight was scheduled to start at 315 pm they preponed it to 3 pm they have this weird rule that you have to web check in 1 hour before the flight and they dont have the facility to check in physically at the terminal my fatherin law who was the passenger who was returning from pune to hyderabad was a senior citizen and was returning back after attending the death ritual of a relative had a harrowing time with arrogant staff who were not willing to help him they said they will refund the airfare but fingers crossed show me the money and then i will believe some thing is wrong with spicejet lots of problems too many flight delays cancellations we should avoid this airline
17693,scoot,9,clean comfortable flight,knowing that the flight was full scoot assigned me and my family seats for free when i was supposed to pay upon checkin i was met by a stern and unfriendly ground staff member and that unfriendliness continued with the ground staff handling the boarding gate they looked depressed pressured and tired as if they hated their job however once on board the team of flight attendants changed the mood of the flight they ensured everyone was well looked after with their positive attitude throughout the flight the seats gave me extra few inches of legroom and were surprisingly comfortable that combined with the a320neos new cabin feel was a perfect recipe for a clean comfortable and awesome flight the inflight entertainment was rich in content and easy to use however being a wifibased entertainment used by many people on the flight the signal strength was incredibly weak that and the lessthangood ground staff team at yogyakarta were the only two things preventing this flight from getting a solid 1010 the landing was around 10 minutes ahead of schedule and the ground staff team in singapore quickly arranged our bags at a special spot thanks to the long immigration queue in singapore lowcost flying can be identic with nofrills yet dismaying service lousy products and paytonsofbucksforeverything on scoot this wasnt the case for me and they truly deserve the awards theyve just obtained

15997,philippine airlines,8,would fly them again,not sure what to expect because of the reviews i have read about them but since i have a voucher from a cancelled flight thought of giving it a try check in is very long at the time which is no surprise the a330300 though old is very clean seats are comfortable ife is at par with other carriers meals were fantastic overall the service for this 8hr flight was very good like the fact as well that i flew nonstop instead of connecting would fly them again and recommend
20868,transavia,2,no cleaning of the plane has been done,flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process we had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards but wth the boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight as a result the entire passenger queue already after passing the passes control has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded obviously no cleaning of the plane has been done we have found some used napkins on our seats speaking of the seats those were extremely uncomfortable they did have an average leg space for a lowcost ill give them that but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either the armrests could only have been raised halfway so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without ive even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats now im writing this from home with severe back pain that ive experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and i blame the seats for the reference the specific plane was phhzx curiously enough the first flight amssvq didnt have these issues the only thing i can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport but i expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway in any case now my stance towards the airline is never again unless im really forced to
2579,air new zealand,7,not common sense to be offering snacks on disembarkation,it is not common sense to be offering snacks on disembarkation absolutely ridiculous space issues people with needs such as parents with babies toddlers etc passengers needing to connect with other flights either offer the in flight service or dont simple

13724,liat,2,one of the most poorly run airlines,grenada to port of spain liat is one of the most poorly run airlines ive encountered our flight was delayed in grenada but still showed as on time on the display board at the airport even though it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure times we were given no explanation or estimate as to when the flight might depart in fact there were no airline employees anywhere to be seen at the gate it would have been nice if they would have had someone come offer to help expedite checking in for connecting flights in port of spain the airport closes the checkin counters quite far in advance of flight times and getting through immigration and customs is slow our flight ended up leaving about an hour late the aircraft crew were the only professional part of the experience upon arrival in port of spain the hour delay made it impossible to check in for my connecting flight even though i found a customs agent willing to help expedite me through a rather lengthy line i met a fellow passenger in the same situation as me and we realized we had basically just been left stranded in a foreign airport with no idea how to resolve our situation there were no liat agents at the ticket counter to consult with about rebooking the flight or booking accommodations a local trinidian resident noticed we were seemed lost and offered to help but didnt know what to do a random baggage handler not affiliated with liat noticed that myself and the other passenger seemed a bit lost and distressed and offered to call and see if a liat agent was available one finally showed up at the counter but then refused to provide any compensation or explanation for the delay he just played with his mobile phone and gave a half smile whenever i tred to interact with him he told several other passengers he would leave a note for the connecting airlines representative who also was not available and we should have seats on the same flight 24 hours later no confirmation of the booking hotel vouchers or food vouchers were provided i rebooked the flight myself to ensure that i would have a seat the next day the lack of customer service from the ground operation of liat both in grenada and port of spain was appalling i will be rebooking my return flight through another carrier even if i have to eat the cost of the liat ticket
4780,austrian airlines,8,the crew was very nice,the cabin of austrian was quite a shock as totally outdated no privacy for most seats no direct access to corridor for many seats near the windows and a miserable toilet kit food was excellent wines as well with a very nationalistic touch as only austrian wines the crew was very nice very attentive flight was on time and loading well organised

5859,bmi regional,6,chop and change routes,not a bad airline but there are certain things that people should be made aware about them they constantly chop and change routes meaning that you can book a flight thinking that you will be going a certain time but then emailed to tell you later that that flight no longer operates this happened to me i had to book a hotel and take a half day off work at the last minute simply because they had changed their route times staff are good planes comfortable if a little long in the tooth could do with some upgrading inside i used to fly with bmi many years ago on exact same planes they have not changed any at all snack and drink included but prices are not the cheapest and on some routes simply expensive all in decent airline had better though but also had worse
8396,edelweiss air,6,edelweiss air customer review,cape town to zurich my experience did not start very well because i could not do the online checkin so i when to the airport cpt very early for checkin ground service was very disorganized when ground staff arrived there was some people queueing but the staff ignored those people and organized the queue has people was not there confusing between passengers occurred just because the staff did not made a small effort when i got to the checkin desk the staff did not make any effort to get me a better seat as asked after spending a couple of hours waiting we board on time when i was getting in the plane my seat was changed and it was changed for a window seat that i do not like i look to my original seat and there was not even children involved in the changing no reason was gave to me if they mess up with something they should had changed me to a better seat not a worst seat confort was not good legs space was small food was just ok and entertainment was very good
7275,cityjet,5,cityjet customer review,london city to dublin first time using cityjet and london city airport a great little airline booking the fare it was refreshing to see that the amount you first see is the amount you actually end up paying ie no extra charges not even a handling charge which is effectively a charge for nothing my trip to the airport did not go to plan and i ended up at the airport ten minutes before departure they advertise that you can check in up to ten minutes before departure at city and sure enough the staff got me on that flight although checkin had just closed the staff at the ticket counter were helpful i had already checked in online but needed to have my boarding card printed then one of them ran with me to the gate given the reduction in service levels across most airlines in recent years i couldnt believe this flight was fine pleasant crew complementary sandwich and bar service the crew came through the cabin several times offering drinks smaller aircraft made for easier boarding and disembarkation london city a great little airport with no distance between the checkin area and the train station overall this was a great experience compared to heathrow or gatwick and the actions of the staff that evening saved me a lot of money and stress in getting me on that flight i would have had to pay for a new flight and overnight at a hotel and missed half a days work otherwise

20374,thomas cook airlines,8,a bargain and the flight was fine,boston to manchester with a scheduled departure time of 1735 with an arrival time of 0455 the next morning i checked on the punctuality of this route and found that the plane often took off about 15 minutes early but almost always arrived on time or a bit earlier that was the case with my flight cabin baggage in economy is limited to 6 kg my carry on bag was easily 15 kg but since i was not checking a bag i figured that once i checked in i would simply print my boarding pass and go directly to the gate i know logan airport well and there are no scales at the gates but i was wrong it is impossible to print a boarding pass from home everyone must go to the check in counter because of this i had to check in one bag and make sure that my carry on was under 6 kg i also put my laptop in another small bag which the check in person didnt see once my bag was weighted no one ever questioned it or inspected it i could have had a friend waiting for me and simply stuffed my bag after checking in or simply left my bag with my friend and arrived with no bag whatsoever so beware you must be careful as they weigh all carry on bags at boston the flight was fine free meal chicken or beef and free muffin and coffee before landing everything else costs money cans of beer were 4gbp no individual screens on the seat backs just drop down screens like in the 1970s no problem seats were a bit tight but otherwise fine staff was lovely for 139gbp one way from boston to the uk it was a bargain great deal and i would fly them again just bring a book or some thing to keep you occupied bring a bottle of water i would fly them again because its a bargain and the flight was fine

15666,openskies,5,openskies customer review,flew june 29 2012 in new eco service 3x3 for last 11 rows of plane this would be difficult travel for strangers in same row very much domestic type economy seats unusual policies also asked if i could buy an upgrade and they said i could have but it would have been only at the ticket counter at the ticket counter i was told to ask at the gate difficult to get checked in with contract service handling flight the gate area was chaotic and that is being generous had to ask about lounge pass which as sapphire one world they were to recognize they gave it and told me to use priority security lines but the boarding pass and code would not work as it needed to be generated at time of boarding pass from the time i booked the flight to when we took it they instituted eco class when booked i thought i was coming back through ewr and would be worth the trouble because i would have economy plus 2 weeks before the scheduled flight they changed config to add 3rd class of service i would not do that again we were fortunate to have 3 seats for 2 of us but had the class been full it would have been a nightmare for 8 hours nice cabin crew lousy food ipads for entertainment were a plus

8823,ethiopian airlines,4,upgraded seat which i never received,1 i paid for an upgraded seat which i never received 2 in addressing the air hostess and head management i was told we are full so sit down 3 the television screen was broken and i was told it would be reset 6 hrs later nothing and dont ask for ear headsets because they seem to decide when and who can have these are not handed freely 4 the staff chose to ignore general passengers when they ask for anything and often reply ill go look or let me see and never come back or just avoid getting to you at all 5 they rudely wake you up when serving anything and if you ask for anything additional they feel the need to blame you for not taking at the right time 6 staff were untidy i would think pride in what you do starts from appearance 7 this airline needs serious intervention and management needs guidance on handling staff and passengers 8 to top it off they must know they are a problem as at the end of the flight not one member of the crew was found at the door exiting and i came from the back of the plane so they had ample time to converse and say farewell to passengers as all other airlines do i suppose they knew what passengers would say to them and chose to go elsewhere

7733,croatia airlines,9,croatia airlines customer review,athzagspu return first section an a319 in good condition clean with pre assigned seats the domestic section with q400 i do not like that plane i think it is uncomfortable for the passengers with tiny toilet the service is excellent special meal tasteful with beverage or winebear newspapers no english stewards were very friendly and eager to serve you on time boarding on the planes but delays on departures sometimes due to controllers sometimes due to transferring passengers
9333,fiji airways,2,could not answer any questions,we were told there would be a one hour delay for 9 pm departure at the end of that 1 hour we were told there be another hour delay at the end of that hour we were told there would be another hour delay because we were changing planes we received only 1 communication per hour and no explanation until the last announcement when finally boarding we were told that due to the late nature of our flight that their own booking people would be rebooking all of our connecting flights for us and they would be waiting at the gate in la with our new flights and boarding passes that was a lie it did not happen all of us ended up having to go through rebooking in la after exiting customs and security and nobody from fiji airways in la had any idea why we were there most of our connecting flights were all missed and we were on our own booking connecting flights with 2 overwhelmed fiji air people at every point where they said they would have things fixed for us they lied their gate staff at nadi were completely clueless and could not answer any questions
8236,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,iomnclnclabz great little airline very personal service form the point of checkin to inflight service both flights only half full so made the experience very pleasant extremely efficient and takes the edge in levels of service
4257,american eagle,6,unfortunately not wonderful,our american eagle flight from srq to charlotte flt 5521 departing srq at 130 pm on april 13 was unfortunately not wonderful the flight attendant for business was curt draconian in approach and very stingy with snacks i have flown this route numerous times and when i have asked for more than one item it was gladly given not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant and even then when she returned and i watched her stow the leftover snacks and i asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part the other issue is that in prior flights on crj 900s i have always been able to stow a rollaboard which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft when i asked this attendant why the policy had changed she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law ie the need to check rollaboards you can check your records to see how often i have flown this route from either srq to charlotte or dca and i was always allowed to bring a bag on board i sense that my question which was very diplomatically phrased was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction i have flown american for years and prior to the pandemic was in executive platinum status for many of them it is discouraging to have had a rude attendant particularly when we paid to be in business class it was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities please understand that i dont like giving negative information nor do i wish to complain these are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them but my attitude is always positive and welcoming and i expect no less than those whose service i have procured and this was clearly substandard
14232,luxair,4,luxair customer review,luxcdg on a erj and back on new q400 as always both flights arrived perfectly on time checkin in a rush but unfortunately the ground staff wasnt the friendliest seats very comfortable with plenty of legroom on both types but the best of all were the tasty snacks they served during the short flights a very pleasant experience
21026,tuifly,2,uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight,berlin to fuerteventura bad experience narrow seats almost no legroom uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight for the better seats you have to pay 30 or 35 euros although the tickets are not cheap catering is expensive and not good rude passengers pushing their sears back without asking and even reacting aggressively when you ask them to push the seat back in upright position long check in lines no inflight entertainment seats in left 11 row have no window
6665,cathay pacific airways,6,cathay is now in the middle of the pack,my how things have changed we flew cathay 5 years ago when our son went to school in hong kong cathay rivaled the best airlines just completed a flight flight attendants still wonderful facilities very good as always very nicely designed business class seats food way worse did not even serve a dinner on our flight just a lunch and breakfast and it really was nothing special no more pajamas either on a 15 hour flight amenity kit also got a downgrade cathay is now in the middle of the pack as far as im concerned no longer a top airline i would imagine the slowdown in hong kong has really hurt them and they decided to cheapen the product too bad
17687,saudi arabian airlines,4,very disappointing,flight was on the runway for almost an hour before pilot apologised and stated that there was a technical problem that needed to be solved at the gate stranded in the aircraft ever since i had to ask for water and then a further round was given to us we are supposed to be 2 hours into the flight already on the way here the food offered was worthy of a budget airline waffles and a hard croissant for breakfast very disappointing for a skyteam alliance member
8947,etihad airways,2,service poor,we were very disappointed by the following seats very cramped when queuing for the toilet you felt you were imposing on peoples personal space service poor we waited for over two hours for some water our wine with dinner on all flights never appeared on each journey we only had one drink bearing in mind our flights were all over 11hrs the inflight entertainment system didnt work on our last flight the only things available was bbc world news and a few games the food selection was poor and often ran out on one flight both meals had bland dry pasta for the vegetarian option the vegetarian curry option on another flight was actually very tasty we will not be booking with airline again and have advised friends and family to avoid
7085,china southern airlines,9,kept inquiring about relevant information,our flight departed at 1230 in the evening on june 29 2021 we need to provide a valid pcr test report for 48 hours before boarding when we arrived at the airport to check in we were told that our test report might not meet new zealands entry requirements we were very frustrated fortunately staff from china southern airlines kept inquiring about relevant information for us finally with the help of staff we took the flight back to new zealand on time thank you for your quick accurate professional and solving problems for us
6553,cathay dragon,7,reasonable regional business class,shanghai to hong kong a reasonable regional business class offering seats are nothing special in a 2x2x2 layout with minimal recline and space but are sufficient for a short range business class flight generally cathay dragon aircraft are old and this was no exception with this particular a330 being 21 years old crew were friendly and attentive and food selection was ok i feel that cathay dragon is very middle of the road in terms of what it offers at the front end of the cabin
22917,xiamen airlines,4,crew were really pleasant,dublin to xiamen via amsterdam the crew were really pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful very clean plane and comfortable seat the usual lie flat entertainment was so poor with a very small selection of movies maybe we expect more as the westernmideastern airlines give you a really decent selection the food was below par and no great shakes at all big nono they did not serve any vodka this is a very first for me on any airline worldwide and i fly 3040 times a year with gin is this possibly the worlds most popular white spirt i only drink an odd vodka and tonic so i went without however for the value and it was an offer i had to give 4 stars other airlines for my destination were 4500 more expensive and that is a big saving if the fare narrows to 2250 i would fly another
608,aeromexico,2,are rude and unprofessional,the staff in mexico city are rude and unprofessional i went to terminal 2 which is what my ticket said and waited for someone to check us in finally at 830 they said no you go to terminal 3 i go over there and the lady said sorry your flight is already gone i said it wasnt supposed to leave until 915 she said you should of checked in i told her ive been trying nobody will help me and my phone has no service here she said to me not my problem you have to buy more tickets i asked to speak with a manager she sent javier to me he said nothing i can do you gotta buy more tickets or go to a different airline if you dont like i which i ended up doing i went to american airline and thanks to them i got home
3086,air transat,7,outrageous customer service,we booked for a 3 week vacation after 6 days at resort we received an email telling us we had to come home at the end of 2 weeks with a full refund for 1 week hotel accommodation credited to our credit card several emails and phone calls and no response to either myself or my travel agent we have been home for 10 weeks outrageous customer service right now not certain will use again especially after they changed our departure airport from london to toronto and only offer take it or leave it offer cost us extra money for hotel and food both for departure and arrival plus hour drive both ways and we are seniors
19968,thai airasia,5,there is miscommunication,nagoya to bangkok mostly my review is concerned to ground operation service in nagoya airport as my flight was cancelled due to flight cancellation ground operation of thai air asia in chubu centrair nagoya intl airport could not be handling this incident properly as there is miscommunication between airline and shops at this airport for meal voucher redemption a meal voucher has been provided for passengers once i got and straight away to redeem it as it was 2130 hrs i went to subway they rejected this airline meal voucher and i went down to lawson they also rejected finally it was a miscommunication between airline and shops
13026,korean air,6,business class product is subpar,auckland to seoul i found a lot of the business class service systems of korean air quite odd whilst the crew were polite and responsive they are working within a set system that means their business class product is subpar for example your menu which includes the wine list is taken off you immediately after departure so you cannot refer back to it this makes ordering wine particularly difficult another thing is that if you order the korean meal options then you are deprived of the additional food such as a soup starter and bread that people ordering western meal options receive they are not even offered and as a result i was starving after my small bowl of rice porridge ive never been left hungry after a meal even in economy class there was no indication of what snacks were on offer luckily i was sitting next to a frequent flier and he kept ordering interesting snacks and so i followed suit on a 12 hour daytime flight during which two meals were served there were only two drink runs by the crew and they were both during the second meal service i had to constantly request a drink and at one stage even went to the galley to see what types of wine were available i really didnt like this approach to service i much rather have the drinks offered rather than have to proactively request for them however this seems to be the way they do things you wont be offered anything beyond the bare minimum but staff are happy to respond if you do request things the ife was poor a very limited selection of mainstream movies and little in the way of reading materials the seat was comfortable and the cabin was spotless including the toilets which were regularly cleaned so whilst the hard product was good and the service was polite and efficient i really felt it was a bare bones service culture and therefore i did not feel pampered or spoilt as i usually do in business class it really felt they were trying to minimise costs by keeping the food and drink away from the public eye
22476,volotea,1,not enough space between these seats,on both ways we had the last seat on the planes 26a 26b 26c and 26d these seats do not have any window and there is not enough space between these seats and the front seat we had a baby with us who was sitting on the legs of his mother that was scary because the free space between the baby and the front seat was less than a hand palm we didnt have an extra scale for the back seats there was only one scale at the front of the airplane my husband forgot his polo ralf lauren hat which he placed on his seat he realized it immediately when we were on the bus on the way from the plane to the arrivals because it was late and with the baby it was difficult to go back to get it so i called the next morning the lost and found department of volotea in order to inform me how i can get the hat the answer was that nothing was delivered to them and to call again the next day which i did but again the answer was negative no hat has been found
13979,lot polish airlines,2,it was a torture,the economy seats on such a long flight more than 8hrs are very narrow i was seating at the emergency row but this didnt help to achieve some level of comfort i am only 58kg women with super lean body shape and practically didnt have any space to move when meals were served i could use my utensils and stand up to eat men next to me spilled his drink as he hit my elbow i never flew a plane with such narrow seats some people were standing most of the flight it was a torture and it is completely unacceptable
6742,cebu pacific,6,dont have conveyer for the baggage,flew to caticlan with 5j 903 the flight was smooth from manila there was flight delay but didnt bring any hassle until we arrived in a caticlan 5 dec 2022 around 230pm a dainty decent airport so here its goes they dont have conveyer for the baggage and i stood up on the stage where they were placing the bags to be collected then staff called me out i immediately step down and apologized but he was so rude and unprofessional when a coworker he was telling him what happened in a very gossipy manner like he is just in the street and not in his uniform working
18717,south african airways,8,quite modern and comfortable,new york jfk to johannesburg cabin staff was an absolute pleasure attentive and very professional the business class cabin is quite modern and comfortable id rate the food pretty okay so ill definitely be flying saa more frequently although id really appreciate some wifi connectivity its 2017 saa
20628,tigerair,3,tigerair customer review,we travelled to and from chennai indiasingapore on 9th june and 16th june 2014 flight was not at all comfortable take off and landing were bumpy its accepted that flight is one of the cheapest for asia pacific region but they could at least serve a glass of water for free on a flight of 4 hours all drinks including water cost 4 s space between seats is too small to be comfortable
5244,bahamasair,6,staff were very friendly,wanted to leave this review for two major reasons 1 the reviews i read about the company were quite outdated and was not sure what to expect and 2 the number of bad reviews created a wrong source of expectation prior to my flights my flight was a return one to havana cuba about 4550 mins flying time even though the feedback for bahamas air was quite negative i must say that it was much better than with other companies ive flown wizzair ryanair the only negative thing was that the flight was delayed about 40 mins in each direction which is not something uncommon with flights generally the staff were very friendly and for such a short fly they also served some snacks i must outline that the crew even went the extra mile since they dont offer hot beverages onboard but were kind enough to find some for us there was plenty of seats since the flight was half full i didnt experience anything mentioned in the previous reviews like bad customer service safety hazards during the flight lost or delayed luggage if this was something that might have been the case in the past seems that the airline significantly improved
20910,transavia,1,usual amount of delay half an hour,amsterdam to thessaloniki flying at least every 68 weeks for the past 2 years and i almost never landed on time the usual amount of delay is at least half an hour in almost every of my flights and today we are already stuck in amsterdam for at least half an hour again due to the incompetence for not finishing the boarding in time
18043,silkair,4,the service is satisfied,singapore to wuhan in general the service is satisfied however i cant agree that its value of money the price level of silkair is almost as its parent company singapore airline but the cabin service is too far away from what its price suggests i ordered noodle in this flight and the taste was plain the only memorable thing was they do serve icecream and the seat space was as narrow as budget airline i couldnt believe thats what a singapore airline full service subsidiary looks like
20925,transavia,5,lack of communication,my 2 friends and i flew first with klm from berlin to amsterdam and then with transavia from amsterdam to marrakesh and back vice versa both trips with transavia werent 100 enjoyable due to the following reasons 1 lack of communication on luggage before flying there was no communication that there are differences in the hand luggage policy between klm 1 pieces accessory and transavia 1 piece yes the additional hand luggage has been checked in by transavia for free but an information beforehand would have been appreciated in order to consider packing in the first place reason provided by staff at airport were a low budget airline fair point still created misunderstanding and negative experience 2 lack of little pleasantries no free snack or beverage on a 35hrs flight 3 lack of visibilitytransparency on flight details no possibility to check flight information online on website reason provided by customer service booking includes flights from 2 airlines klm transavia 4 lack of communication at airport in marrakesh at 6am information screen stated that checkin counter is open staff appeared at 645am staff at airport only said that weve to wait its okay to wait but then dont say that the checkin is open in general i have understanding for a lot of things but id just appreciate more communication and visibility on possible differences to other airlines upfront
19834,tap portugal,6,staff were friendly,this was a short flight from lisbon to faro after my previous flight into lis with tap needed to be rebooked due to a long delay which would have left me stranded over night in lis the boarding was ontime and without problems they let us wait a long time in the bus though the plane was modern and roomy staff were friendly and efficient arrival was on time and deboarding quick and efficient seat was comfortable but nothing special
11794,japan airlines,6,rule is book 24 hours in advance,no vegetarian options in the sakura lounge when requested we have run out of options booked jain meal for parents they only have request for one sector tokyo to bangalore and not for sfo to tokyo the rule is book 24 hours in advance who would book only one sector we book business class to get personalised attention and care the seats are good and comfortable i might still travel jal for my own logistics reasons of timings etc but not because i felt good with the airline
4654,asiana airlines,5,i wont bother again,flew sydney to london via seoul and return in economy after reading many reviews about asiana i thought id fly with them this time back to the uk but after this time i wont bother again its not that theyre bad but sia and cathay pacific are so much better the food was nothing special and rather odd in texture the entertainment system was old with poor response from the touch screen and very limited choice of movies i dont sleep well on flights so usually spend a lot of time watching movies i didnt finish one baggage allowance was a measly 20kg not that i expect to travel with all my household furnishings but id like to travel and not worry im going to go over my weight allowance on the outbound flight from sydney my wife was asleep so i ate her snack my bad after she woke up i went to see if i could get her another one that was a no as she already had her allocated snack with cathay just in the crew area they have bowls of fruit and other snacks that you can help yourself to want something hot no bother with cx have some noodles an annoying thing when youre trying to sleep is that whenever we hit turbulence the screen would light up i dont understand korean and maybe its something to do with the korean language but youd get these long announcements but in english it ends up garbled and very brief does korean use more to say less im asian myself and can understand that many asians have trouble with the english language but considering english is the language all airlines are supposed to use the standard was poor and i missed more than i actually caught i suppose you get what you pay for and they where at the cheaper end of the price scale but still its the little things that add up to make it a less than an experience id want to repeat
17878,shanghai airlines,9,shanghai airlines customer review,i was just in the booking process for a shanghaixian flight in discounted first class when they interrupted my input and changed the fares instead of a surcharge of 20 above the eco fare they lowered the economy fares substantially and came to a ratio of 13 i immediately switched to the new discounted eco fare landed at less than 40 of the original budget and felt quite comfortable the flight from hongqiao apt to xian takes a little more than two hours one can really accept all the environment and service features they offer clean 737800 with better seat pitch than most european airlines they offer a hot snack enroute two choices a limited beverage selection no alcoholic beverages do not expect a sophisticated ife just those small screens above your head for every second row the flight was fully booked absolutely on time and a real bargain what more can you expect my marks are once again quite high for this china eastern affiliate
21986,vistara,8,service was good,currently only vistara offers premium economy in indian domestic sector price is slightly above economy but worth for that 1st 4 rows after business class is premium economy seat pitch are good comfortable than any airline except business class priority check in and boarding for premium economy passengers first they served cold towels which was a pleasant starting though it doesnt matter much but they shared a menu for the flight food was good for a domestic flight service was good flight departed and arrived on time
2449,air namibia,5,air namibia customer review,service on board is not so bad but everyday you must fight with cancellations delays and unbelievable situations sometimes i fly domestically and generally they are not so bad but awful when i flew long haul wdhfra in fra after we checked baggage they announced the flight to wdh was delayed until the next day it was no possible to get your luggage back sw paid hotel and dinner in a good hotel but airline service was very bad
7480,copa airlines,8,flight was nice,panama city to bogota flight was nice at the gate i asked for a better seat and gave us exit service with chips and drinks on a short flight and even inflight entertainment only drawback had 30 mins delay waited for connecting passengers
2062,air koryo,2,air koryo customer review,pekfnj interesting to say the least outbound was oldest plane i have ever seen in my life il62 and literally falling apart at the seams propaganda handed out announcements regarding how this flight was made possible by the dear leader etc return was same aircraft type but much better shape however upon landing in beijing was quickly sweating due to no air conditioning not like you have much of a choice when flying to pyongyang snag air china if you want a safe flight but air koryo if you want the experience
960,air austral,9,air austral customer review,flew air austral sydrunmauritiusrunsyd it is 100 better then air mauritius the food was great and flight attendants were excellent and friendly ive got a 19 month old so they kept the middle seat for us free and they kept offering to help and asked if everything was ok the only drawback is theres no ptv and not much info from cockpit
4604,asiana airlines,9,very surprised by this airline,london to seoul via osaka with asiana airlines i was very surprised by this airline first leg of the journey we were going on the a350 we had plenty of leg room though the seats were a bit uncomfortable cabin crew were very friendly and they spoke perfect english food was very good i chose the korean option from london to seoul and when coming back to london i chose the western option very good both for airplane food if you dont like spicy dont choose the korean option entertainment was a bit limited not as many options as other carriers like emirates and i was disappointed they didnt have any korean dramas overall a good airline price was cheap compared with korean airlines or the japanese carriers
268,aer lingus,4,seats are too close together,food is bad service is no more than they have to do not very friendly seats are too close together half of the screens dont work i think it is time to update your aircraft
8658,ellinair,6,expensive considering the quality of service,both flights i took from thessaloniki to athens return had a delay the aircraft was tiny and the air condition was blowing warm air it really felt like a bus the cabin crew was professional kind and tried to counterbalance this mess the ticket was a bit cheaper relative to other companies but very expensive considering the level and the quality of service provided
9625,flair airlines,1,dont care about their passengers time,i agree with one of the reviews they dont care about their passengers time our flight was delayed for more than 5 hours they said it was for passengers safety they need to do maintenance thats a lie probably there flight is not full so they moved it to a later time we need to go to toronto just for 3 days thats why we got the latest flight so well get to toronto by 1am the next day take a few hours rest then start our day but because of this our tight schedule is even tighter now their website said that youll be compensated for the meal or hotel accommodations but when i try to fill out their compensation form theres no option for it just rebook or refund i was hoping to atleast get a nice hotel room while waiting for more than 5 hours so we can rest comfortably and near the airport their checked baggage is so expensive as well as their hand carry
18010,sichuan airlines,8,sichuan airlines customer review,shenzhen chongqing new a320 good service mandarin with no local accent poor english but acceptable for a regional flight okay food toilet clean
7340,comair,3,comair customer review,flew plzjnb as part of a ba ticket to lhr simply put check in was a nightmare a bag of 25kg that had travelled with us from lhr at the same weight was rejected as overweight even though the original baggage tag with weight clearly marked was still attached we spent 30 minutes at club check in unpacking and re packing our bags on the dirty airport floor with all our possessions spread out highly embarrassing until i turned around to see someone at every other counter doing the same the manager explained that as a franchise of ba a fact not made clear during booking nor even at the airport ba insisted they adhere to strict baggage limits for international flights even when they could see that we were executive gold and bronze and had flown over with bags the same weight for this i blame ba but the local staff could have tried to appear less pedantic and could also have found someone with a far more pleasant demeanour for the club desk i booked with ba for the service but on this leg was sorely disappointed
18824,southwest airlines,1,doing a great job despite the circumstances,stellar employees at southwest ground crew attendants pilots etc true dedication to their work and doing their best during these challenging times our flight was delayed multiple times during that time i was able to do some research as to what was going on due to severe storm activity across the country many airlines had to cancel flights southwest included i understand people being upset but what i appreciate is southwests ongoing communication to let their passengers know ahead of time that the airline and flights were experiencing irregular operations they clearly assure their passengers ahead of time if your flight was canceled and you would like a refund please submit a request so i went fully knowing my flight could be cancelled of course multiple delays the ground crew communicated with us multiple times telling us they were doing what they could that something had happened to their network could have it been hacked or challenges with having to cancel flights due to storm activity regardless this airline wouldnt have cancelled if they felt the airways were safe or they had the capacity then to our amazement they were able to organize the crew offline and get us on our flight home these are trying times shutdowns due to mysterious viruses freaky weather some things cant always be controlled or predicted but the response is what matters southwest is doing a great job despite the circumstances and i will continue to fly with this airline
14526,malindo air,3,regret not sticking to the competitor,flown many times with malindo generally not great and not terrible this trip im extremely disappointed with malindo our mid morning flight was cancelled and changed to 830 am then 3 days before flight it was changed to 7 pm basically our whole day has been destroyed i thought id help malindo by flying them but now regret not sticking to the competitor

12590,jetstar pacific,2,already been delayed twice,ho chi minh to danang we have already been delayed twice now leaving 9 hours later than expected we are bracing ourselves for 12 more delays it is likely they keeping delaying people to a flight that will be full enough in order to save them money thanks for a complete absence of customer service jetstar i will do my best to deter anyone else from using your sorry excuse of an airline
22395,volaris,1,not worth the cheaper ticket,mexico city to houston never use this airline cheap flight cost means no service the information given at the airport is never correct the website on the phone should update with gate information and it does not the people at the counters have no idea what they are doing or any regard for foreign travelers we spent the time between our connecting flights running back and forth between gates when we asked about the correct gate the staff responded irritated that we were asking definitely not worth the cheaper ticket price for the hassle we experienced
1082,air berlin,5,noticed a steady decline,stockholm to berlin i frequently fly with air berlin since a few years back and have recently noticed a steady decline in the quality of the service first air berlin started charging for baggage then they wouldnt let you select a seat and recently they removed the free drinks and snacks i have not noticed any difference in the prices other than this several other experiences have negatively affected my opinion recently my girlfriends bags were lost by air berlin for the second time and they promised she would get a refund for everything we even called the support to make sure however all she got was a coupon to use when booking flights through the ab website the value of the coupon was 13 of what the clothes cost as for my personal experiences a few months ago i missed a connecting flight because of the first flight was delayed the lady at the service desk told me that i would not get anything because i had more than enough time to make it eventhough i ran as fast as i could as for the positive the planes are rather clean and the prices are decent also air berlin flies to txl

16022,philippine airlines,3,i recommend avoiding them,they delayed my flight a total of 3 times 2 of wich were without notice and caused me to miss a connecting flight i had to wait for 5 extra hours on the airport and they were extremely slow in the handling of the baggage too making me fear they had lost my bags because they werent even sure where they had put them the cheap price is not worth the hassle and i recommend avoiding them if you have any connecting flights

7925,cubana airlines,6,cubana airlines customer review,yu snu return a320 lease from taca airlines instead of an ilyushin aircraft we chose this airline because it had decent schedules checkin in montreal was normal the legroom was really good for a 3h30 flight safety demo shown on video in spanish with english subtitles announcements onboard also made in french service onboard wasnt the best but it was average however one flight attendant didnt seem to like her job on return flight checkin in santa clara airport was slow and disorganized sure cubana is not a great carrier like air france or lufthansa but its okay

1761,air france,6,never encountered such incompetence,shame on air france for its disgraceful performance and for doing nothing thus far to settle a claim for clothes and incidentals i had to buy after my luggage was delayed last december when returning from guinea to washington dc in business class i must have now called air france a dozen times to find out the status of my claim each time i get bounced around from one agent to another each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever one agent today told me that the only way to communicate with af is via social media and suggested i try twitter and facebook ive already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response ive now escalated the matter with my firm and with amex which did the booking as my companys corporate travel partner shame on air france ive never encountered such incompetence

16119,play,8,everything is by social media,the flight was on time the plane appeared new and clean a lot of space even in economy service was courteous and attentive overall a very pleasant surprise they charge for every single item but the total price was about 30 cheaper than the alternative the only negative is that they are not hooked into the tsapre system fairly minor point in baltimore somehow strange experience in that you have very little interaction with human employees in the process in keflavik you check in your own case scan it and put it on the conveyor belt yourself no telephone number to call everything is by social media they do not have inflight entertainment or wifi
611,aerosur,7,aerosur customer review,dxbika a300600 aircraft clean cabin with friendly flight attendants variety of meals were good but the quality of meal was very poor

2817,air seychelles,2,most unfriendliest youll meet,johannesburg to mumbai via mahe the staff in flight and at the airport must be the most unfriendliest youll meet for the entire flight of passengers theres 2 people at 1 counter doing the check in takes 45 mins for a flight half full the guy at the luggage scan asked us to make it quick as the flight is leaving as if it was our fault theres only 1 counter receiving check ins there is no time in transit youre shipped from 1 flight to the other there is no place to smoke but was advised by a guy that smoking in the toilet isnt permitted but allowed its the smallest airport ive been to with barely any facilities taking all this into consideration i see no reason why they should have an attitude flights itself are clean but outdated in entertainment if you not fussy this is a cheap alternative if you need to travel in some comfort pay more
9402,finnair,6,no champagne when boarding,no champagne when boarding apparently some rule that finnair cant serve alcohol on the ground so blueberry juice or orange juice upgraded interior looks good but seats are so uncomfortable poor selection for breakfast in business class and for prelanding food was the only option a chicken skewer 1 hour free wifi but you cant pause it so when you have logged in you better go the whole hour
76,adria airways,4,adria airways customer review,fraviefra on crj200 cheapest option when compared to lufthansa and austrian plying this short 15 hour flight small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position larger carryon bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age quite saggy in the squab service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea coffee fas smiling the return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at fra luggage claim was quick
16448,qantaslink,8,will fly qantaslink and this route again,i have flown this service before it is a quick flight between the 2 major regional cities in the north approx 45 min flying time cutting down around a 3 to 4 hour drive there is no classes available and whilst you could select your seat it was on a first come first served basis the plane was full only a few empty seats so no opportunities to move seats it is mostly workers commuting between the cities or to connecting charter flights for mining we were slightly late on take off due to the catering being late the catering company also failed to deliver the alcohol so they made the decision to leave without it we did however land on time i cant blame the airline for this but i was looking forward to having a glass of wine they provided an inflight snack manna from heaven which was a small box of 3 x bite sized snacks very tasty your choice of soft drink considering the flight time was so short the cabin staff did well to serve the whole cabin do a rubbish collection and then we were ready for descent the cabin crew were courteous and efficient but nothing jumped out to me as a wow the cabin and seats themselves are very tight and not a lot of room i would imagine it would very uncomfortable for a tall or large person i am only 5 ft especially of the flight was longer then 1 hour the cabin was clean there is no entertainment provided or wifi aboard but again for such a short hop it isnt needed i will fly qantaslink and this route again
21996,vistara,6,soft product was found to be wanting,i cannot fault the hard product modern clean and well maintained aircraft but the soft product was found to be wanting the crew seemed to go about their job in a robotic nature no smile no pleasantries and the service was very disjointed the food was a big let down and expected much better it was bland poor quality and mine was inedible
4216,american airlines,7,great assistance she gave,i really to thank you deborah martin from american airlines la for a great assistance she gave to a friend and i we got out flight changed at the last minute while we was waiting to do the check in it was changed for the next day and she fixed it putting us in the next flight getting to the destination at the same time we really appreciate thank you again
3486,airasia x,4,fa serving my row was most friendly,been through flying airasia x more than 15 times and service can be inconstant on my recent flight from auckland to gold coast the flight was barely half full for the evening flight so we departed early after the seatbelt signs turn off the cabin staff did not appear until about an hour later starting the meal services the prebooked meal out of auckland was overcooked bland and small portion they didnt give a set of plastic cutlery instead only giving the spoon for the meal when asking the knife and fork one of the fa reply that the meal only need spoon and we have deficient for the fork for this flight a complimentary mineral water was not served until asking them at gold coast we disembark with stairs and after the transit check we board again with new set of crew for this 7hr 50 flight a lovely australian or new zealand fa serving my row was most friendly that i have had encounter with she kneeled down when interacting with every passenger
5536,belavia,5,airport belavia employees really rude,saint petersburg to minsk so first hosts was good no problem about them but in airport belavia employees was really rude same week i had 2 more flights with delta and air france and did not have any problem like this i will never flight with belavia anymore
2603,air niugini,6,a very pleasant surprise,singapore to port moresby given the limited choice available on the market to reach port moresby only qantas and air philippines travel there i was forced to take air niugini it was a very pleasant surprise plane was not too old cabin was very decent clean entertainment somewhat limited but of reasonable quality food was ok plane is almost always empty which means lots of space also in economy board personnel is not as shiny as you could see on emirates or qatar but kind gentle and professional a surprise
17057,royal jordanian airlines,4,wifi does not let you access anything,i ordered the lasagna but it was horrible i couldnt pull it apart because they put the cheese first on top so it was literally impossible to eat it the entertainment website on board i think has less than 60 movies and the wifi does not let you access anything except their website they do not even offer a package so you can speak with your family members
10101,frontier airlines,1,appalled at the behavior of the staff,im absolutely appalled at the behavior of the staff on board we havent even departed and i have heard the flight attendance talk negatively about the attendant welcoming guests boarding speak rudely to a handicapped guest trying to place their crutches and then discuss in front of me whether i flushed a toilet that i didnt use while i was in the bathroom to take my medication in private prior to entering the bathroom one attendant shared how much she hate this plane what on earth is so wrong with this company that they would allow these humans to be in charge of these passengers most of them seemingly do not care about anyone but themselves its truly a disgrace
18252,singapore airlines,4,late by up to 90 mins,flight i had with singapore airlines are late by up to 90 mins on arrival its inferior to qatar airways business class underwhelming lounges okay onboard catering no diningondemand quirky flatbed seats on the a350ulr and more so on the new a380 meager amenities onboard the cabin crew is somewhat the only part of singapore airlines nearly on par with qatar airways
10388,germanwings,7,germanwings customer review,4u7779 and 4u7778 may16 and may 26 prghamprg economy class a decent low cost option for short flights within europe if you want to get from a to b in a cost efficient manner its an alternative flights wouldve left on time if it wouldnt have taken the flight attendants almost 10 minutes to get a passenger to finally stop talking on his cell phone thus delaying the safety instructions the inflight magazine is the worst ive ever seen its full of advertisements although i didnt order anything the prices for beverages and snacks seem to be the same as on other low cost carriers
4907,avelo airlines,2,staff seemed like they somewhat cared,this airline is trying but they could be a lot better the staff is mostly friendly but there are some really rude people that will kick you out of open seats if you move etc which makes zero sense since the plane is in the air this happened to me and my niece on separate flights i get that it is their business model but ultimately you are just going to just annoy people and lose business that way see oneandahalfstar review they only offer water which is fine but no one handed it out or even checked on you the two female flight attendants on my flight just sat in the back and gossiped the entire flight the pilot seemed kind and the rest of the staff seemed like they somewhat cared but most look tired and were pretty cold a smile goes a long way in this business
7321,comair,7,a really nice experience,cape town to port elizabeth via johannesburg first time using comair domestically in south africa marketed as british airways check in at cpt quick and easy using my ba frequent flier status i was offered lounge access at the slow lounge which i must say is pretty good flight boarded on time a new boeing 737800 crew very polite and seating good with space a snack served on the 1 hr 50 min flight bags off quickly on landing jnbplz check in again very quick and polite again offered the use of the slow lounge which is one of the best ive been in boarding on to a pretty old 737400 not full so lots of room the aircraft kept clean and looked in good shape a small hot meal offered by a nice crew departed and arrived on time a really nice experience on both flights
22941,xiamen airlines,3,try to avoid xiamen airlines,beijing to fuzhou and the experience is not good at all it disappointed me a lot i have to admit the food beverage are decent but i got cold before the flight so i tried to ask for a blanket from the cabin crew the lady was not so nice and showed obvious impatience for such normal request she told me she will remember but she never got back to me the ac was strong and i had to suffer it for 3hrsif possible i will try to avoid xiamen airlines and also not recommend my friends to take it
7044,china southern airlines,9,handled the upgrade at the counter,this is my first trip since covid19 in order to make the trip more comfortable i handled the upgrade at the counter the price is very favorable the staff are also very professional and they also provide a lounge there are hot food and drinks in the lounge the service food and drink on board were also excellent after arriving at incheon airport the helpful staff came to talk with us and told me the entry precautions there was no problem with customs and immigration
20447,thomson airways,5,1 service trolly on a 4hour flight,doncaster to tenerife with thomson operated by smartwings do not use them there wasnt a choice of hot drinks only tea and they didnt have any milk only 1 service trolly on a 4hour flight no alcoholic drinks or duty free at all service was not good not much choice of food when i book a thomson flight i expect thomson service
10235,garuda indonesia,8,the crew welcomed us warmly,flying garuda indonesia on a shorthaul flight along with my wife and 8months old son in economy class it was a busy sunday afternoon in adi sucipto airport but the ground staff processed our check in with genuine hospitality on board the crew welcomed us warmly engaged with my son and consistently demonstrated helpfulness and friendliness despite the flight being full both in business and economy class the snack served in economy class was two breads a pack of nuts and a bottle of mineral water garuda has added to capacity in some of its economy class planes making the seat pitch and leg room less narrower and for me personally less comfortable the flight could also have been more enjoyable if garuda added more movie selection in its inflight entertainment system the flight departed and landed on time we appreciated garuda for bringing us back to jakarta safely
8605,el al israel airlines,5,poor for a premium airline,nice to tel aviv old 737 that was refurbished very nicely looked like new all seats and cabin are new real business class with recline seats and all the rest is economy gate and counter location is awful no place to seat super busy and feels like low cost the crew was ok not more than that as el al recently pulled out serving food on eu flights they have very poor salad or sandwich poor not enough for a 4h flight and very uncomfortable security checkin el al asked to arrive airport 3h before departure add the fact the nice airport is very small and so at the end the entire tour is very long a wrong move and poor for a premium airline
5908,boutique air,1,boutique air is always delayed,this airline is a huge scam every single flight is delayed or cancelled we lost 2 days of vacation to start with because after our luggage was not transferred from our aa flight to air boutique they put it on the next flight the next flights kept being delayed and then finally cancelled for 24 hours on the way back the same they delayed the flight first of one hour then two hours so we lost our following flight boutique air is always delayed
2757,air serbia,4,improving its income in this lousy way,before departure zurich belgrade in economy class i received an offer from air serbia by email to upgrade to business class i decided to accept the offer but only for the return flight belgrade zurich because i wanted to do some shopping in belgrade and there would be no room for this in just one suitcase it cost me 95 which was just debited from my mastercard at the checkin in belgrade surprise i have no right to 2 suitcases only one in response to my complaint that business class always includes an allowance for 2 suitcases i was told that i was entitled to all business class amenities except for the number of suitcases but this little thing is not to be found in the upgrade offer mail from air serbia this argument was also ignored by the air serbia officer in the end i had to pay another 6 for the excess 11kg heavy bag i suspect that this is not a coincidence but that air serbia is purposely improving its income in this lousy way vor dem abflug zrich belgrad in economy klasse habe ich von air serbia per mail ein angebot erhalten zu business class zu upgraden ich entschied mich das angebot zu akzeptieren jedoch nur fr den rckflug belgrad zrich weil ich einiges in belgrad einkaufen wollte und dies htte in nur einem koffer keinen platz mehr es kostete mich 95 die grad von meiner mastercard abgebucht wurden bei dem checkin in belgrad berraschung ich habe kein anrecht auf 2 koffer nur auf einen auf meine reklamation dass business class immer allowance auf 2 koffer beinhaltet wurde mir erklrt dass auf alle annehmlichkeiten der business class ich anrecht habe bis auf kofferanzahl diese kleinigkeit aber ist in der upgradeangebotmail von air serbia nicht zu finden auch dieser argument wurde von air serbia beamtin ignoriert am ende musste ich fr das berschssige 11kg schweren gepckstck weitere 65 zahlen ich vermute dass dies kein zufall ist sondern dass air serbia gezielt auf diese miese art ihre einknfte ausbessert
21035,tuifly,2,service level is very low,amsterdam to aruba the service level of this company is very low you have to pay for everything on board during my 9hr flight we have to pay for media entertainment 10euro coffee 25euro coke etc we recieved one meal during 9hrs you better take another company if they cost 100200 euro more because it is more than worth it
16485,qantaslink,9,we had no complaints,flew qantaslink sydney to port macquarie on the 31st following an international arrival on qantas from the uk this flight arrived early and due to a very quick transit through security customs and baggage reclaim we were at domestic 5 hours before our booked flight initially told that by the qantas staff in the terminal that due to our ticket type we would have to wait for this flight despite space being available on the earlier one then spoke to a staff member on the sales desk who was efficient in transferring us without questions and more impressively at nil cost the flight itself was only 50 mins and despite the coffee machine not working we had no complaints most impressive ground staff
12571,jetstar pacific,1,sadly always encounter the worst staff,this is our second flight with jetstar pacific and sadly always encounter the worst staff they try to squeeze the most money out of you checking every bag in the cabin and trying to charge you more to put it as checked luggage this is the only airline ive seen with this policy and the rudeness of the staff is unacceptable we paid for 25kg and had 26kg for whichever they were trying to charge also it is clear that the strategy of the company is to overcharge as much as possible and squeeze every penny just simply avoid it since the rates that you see are not true due to all the extra charges they force you to pay
22385,volaris,1,customer service was horrible,volaris is by far the worst airline that i have ever flown not were the flights just delayed but they boarded us then had to take us off for maintenance and didnt help us change our connecting flights just said not to worry they will handle them when you get to mexico city needless to say after trying to run and catch my gate which i couldve made they said i couldnt board because i needed to go get my bag ended up missing the connection and the next available flight wasnt till the next morning their customer service was horrible they are completely disorganized rude and not helpful at all and had zero compensation for all of the people nothing from food to hotel rooms to transportation credits or refunds the airplane also had no air conditioning food water or anything not only did they waste my money and time but didnt even help resolve the issues at hand
18547,smartwings,4,not the best experience,palma de mallorca to prague not the best experience i had noticed there was an anomaly on the original eticket regarding the 23kg baggage i had paid eur60 for in respect of both the outward journey to palma and the return the original eticket stated that there were 0 pieces for the return from palma i emailed smartwings the day before the outward journey explaining the situation and i had a response within three hours confirming 1 pc of luggage for the return from palma and a new receipt nevertheless at checkin in palma i was informed i could not check in the case because the record stated there were no pieces of luggage with the ticket fortunately after an anxious few minutes i was able to produce a printed copy of the final and amended receipted i had received on request before the outward journey and this was accepted checkin was opened relatively late leaving little time at the departure gate despite the 40minute delay i travel with smartwings and csa regularly rarely on time and there are never apologies for delays expensive especially for a budget airline on the positive side plenty of legroom no food but at least water offered i used to rate sa highly but they seemed to have suffered from the takeover
4370,ana all nippon airways,1,deserves its 5star rating,ana should offer classes to other airlines on how to treat customersthey are so good in so many ways first of all economy class seats are comfortable and pretty roomy the meals are generous interesting and tasty and the staff are just the best always giving service with a smile they engage passengers at every turn japan is a country known for its good service and the crew on this flight was the embodiment of the japanese service standard on this flight there was a full lunch with several dishes and then later a pretty tasty snack video choices are excellent and live tv is offered as well it is a fine airline and deserves its 5star rating
21949,vistara,8,overall a fantastic experience,overall a fantastic experience with vistara though the flight was delayed by half hour the checkin was smooth and quick the inair experience was fantastic there was a wide selection of meals and desserts on offer the vistara a321 is perhaps the only flight in which you can experience lie flat seats and a nice big ife screen in domestic flights within india the service was prompt and pleasant just a few things which could add to the experience a wider selection of content would be needed for international routes the content on offer was great for a domestic hop but thin in case the same selection is offered for an international flight the encalm lounge in delhi is a improvement over the previous lounge but still not comparable to the one in mumbai i ended up leaving immediately and preferred to use the amex lounge over this
21021,tuifly,7,it was a good experience,amsterdam to curacao on december 7th with tui fly netherlands operated by a boeing 7878 checkin was quite chaotic at amsterdam with multiple tui departures at the same time and only one staff member trying to sent passengers to the right checkin row checkin or bag dropoff boarding on the other hand was very smooth and efficient i prebooked economy comfort 34 inch leg space seat 12a which was quite comfortable the seat was quite narrow though the seat was equipped with an ptv with a pretty small selection of movies a free headset and pillow were distributed after take off the crew came around with a drink service alcohol was charged follow by a hot small meal with a drink and coffee or tea during the flight it was possible to order paid snacks or drinks but there were also two complementary drink rounds two hours before landing a sandwich with a slice of cake were handed out which was really tasteful the flight itself was uneventful and the crew was really friendly and professional overall it was a good experience for a typical holiday airline
5491,batik air,8,batik is very good value,jakarta to jayapura comfortable flight with decent food and a good selection of movies the only minor problem was that headsets were not provided and had to be purchased from crew for 25000 rp with the fare very similar to nofrills lion air part of the same group batik is very good value
18077,silkair,9,all around great,i flew from phnom penh to singapore on silkair and it was all around great the staff were friendly one positive thing about is its seats they feel soft and amazing legroom and the food was very tasty i had a tomato pasta with fish and it tasted very decent also the flight entertainment was enjoyable the flight was very smooth and relaxing i would recommend it
18850,spicejet,3,seats were not as expected,one of the worst experiences on a flight i was heading out from new delhi to bangalore and it was not worth the effort the seats were not as expected cleaned the seat covers was teared from one side likewise the seat which is allotted to me dont had the seat movable button since it was broken so all through the entire excursion i needed to sit truly awkward
2906,air tahiti nui,5,business class is old,air tahiti nui is basically the only airline that flies to french polinesia the business class is old and the seat do not recline to 180 its a very long flight from any airport i flew from japan and it was a 12 hours flight the aircraft is very loud there is no privacy in the business seat the food is really good and the staff are really polite the entertainment is quite poor
4315,american eagle,3,worst experience ever,ft walton to albany via washington the attitude of the person at the desk was inapproprate the airline overbooked the flight and was asking for a person to come forward and take a later flight why airlines overbook ill never know but his attitude was really nasty he said in an annoyed voice that if no one came forward it will delay the flight and everyone would miss there connecting flight sounded like a threat to me and many other people secondly to make your connecting flight you have to be bused from the plane to a waiting area and then bused back people wind up standing on the bus both ways in the waiting area etc i fortunately had check my bag at ft walton but those that did not have to get their luggage and bring it on the bus both ways what a mess will never fly american again worst experience ever and i fly quite often
1003,air berlin,1,i was really pleasantly surprised,this was the first trip i tried air berlins then new business class service for europe i was really pleasantly surprised this is in my view a much better product than lh or the likes offer i like that you can get any food or snacks you want from their trolley at no extra charge this is much better than getting a preset tray with food you have no idea what it is air berlin also had very nice hot towels their staff really like what they do the only minus is that they are expensive
11473,insel air,4,insel air customer review,cltcur check in was slow but it was their first week or so on this new route both legs the flights were smooth not packed staff was friendly i felt like i had hit a time warp when they offered beverage a meal food was decent only complaint the return flight rear bathroom could be smelled at least 2 rows away nasty
12659,jin air,7,jin air customer review,hkgcheju return a special chartered flight this is a new budget airline mostly using the old aircraft of korean air domestic all economy with 33 seating check in at hk airport was painfully slow but its made up for with courteous service onboard cabin crew are smartly dressed creating an energetic image for a 3 hour flight juice and coffee as well as a snack box are provided free no tv or any forms of inflight entertainment so be sure to bring your own overall the experience was a pleasant one if the ticket price is right i dont mind to fly with them again

9804,flydubai,4,definition of paying more for less,i had sworn to never fly with flydubai after an 8 hour delay in 2016 however after booking with emirates i had no choice but to choose the codeshare agreement inbound flight with flydubai because everything else was sold out due to the long weekend in bahrain dxbs terminal 2 t2 is a flea market and there is nowhere to sit and eat in addition to the toilets smelling of course we were crammed in buses with zero distancing measures the plane was super hot and the crew members looked like they were about to pass out the air conditioners didnt work properly and there was no monitors for inflight entertainment we were also provided with flydubais baggage allowance which was less than emirates i cant forgive emirates for their codeshare flights via flydubai because they are the literal definition of paying more for less flydubai is not even that cheap anymore when it comes to regional gcc flights avoid if you have other options the staff were friendly and the male crew member in the economy cabin was very patient
12658,jin air,8,jin air customer review,hkgicn this is a korean low cost carrier low cost in the asian sense you still get a meal box and numbered seating i used them having got stuck in hong kong after a problem with my cathay ticket the station manager at hong kong was very helpful the flight was a third full and the service friendly and efficient ontime arrival made all the difference i would definitely recommend
7115,china united airlines,8,china united airlines customer review,beijing nanyuan to hohhot china united is the only airline that uses beijing nanyuan a former military airport in the south of beijing the airport is easy to get to and flights in and out of nanyuan do not seem to be subject to delays as serious as those at beijing capital theres also very little taxiing checkin was quick easy but the checkin area is noisy and dilapidated toilets at the airport werent great the flight was on a newish 737 and the plane was clean service was friendly and the bacon wrap for breakfast was actually very nice takeoff and arrival were both on schedule id use china united again just to avoid the delays at beijing capital

3996,alitalia,2,very unpleasant experience,so paulo to rome horrible experience regarding service the airplane may not be new but considering its economy class the seats are spacious if compared to newer airplanes but what was really terrifying about this flight was the horrible appalling service given by the flight attendants in the section of the airplane where i was seated 22l those staff simply hate their jobs and make it clear that they hate having to serve other people disgracefully these other people are the clients who paid for a seat on their airplanes hoping to receive some decent service which doesnt happen these crew members are the most unkind unattentive and rudest professionals of all crews in european airlines due to my job i have to fly alitalia frequently and its always a very unpleasant experience if you can avoid alitalia whenever possible
23082,xl airways france,6,xl airways france customer review,xl airways france flies twice a week between paris and las vegas the flights are cheap a bit over 1800 for galaxie class 700 for economy both roundtrip separate lines for galaxie class made checkin a breeze boarding was quick in las vegas a mess in paris seats in the small galaxie class section 27 of them on a330 were about what one would expect on a domestic aa or ua flight meals were decent and beverages were available throughout the flights cabin crew were friendly and helpful
21365,united airlines,3,an epic disappointment,to start off this was my husbands and is first time flying united and it was an epic disappointment we arrive 2 hours early here in birmingham to be told your flight here has been delayed and you will miss your connecting flight in houston to los angeles you have the choice to stay here in birmingham or fly to houston and we will provide a hotel room okay we chose to fly to houston because who knows what could happen we end up in a storm in houston no fault to united airlines but the issue is we lost a day in honolulu and our room there was already paid for no refund issued so we fly 7 12 hours straight to honolulu on a crowded flight having to sit in the middle when our seats were originally by the window so i didnt get the beautiful view of what i wanted to see the food was terrible because we received a salad no dressing and i was thankful we ate dinner the flight back wasnt even better we got delayed in los angeles because the flight attendant was late in honolulu then we go to customer service and they did accommodate us at another hotel with food vouchers however the experience was horrible because most of the staff was rude and disingenuous on how to handle customers things could have been worse but paying for baggage being reseated on every flight was all too much and even with them putting us up in hotels we still lost money and a day in honolulu i say this to say we stayed humble through the experience but it was still not enough to repay for our losses also on the flight home from houston there was no wifi service so that sucked yall ask if i would refer you all to others as a last resort but no

6905,china airlines,2,last flight was a disaster,vancouver to taipei i have flown this airline several times and normally had good service but my last flight was a disaster we were scheduled to leave vancouver at 220 am after no notifications the flight was delayed for one hour at 4 am we were told it was now delayed until 8 am after trying to sleep for a few hours on benches or the floor at 830 we were told the flight was cancelled this was just the beginning after going through customs and immigration we never left the country we got back to the checkin counters and formed an enormous queue of approximately 300 they had 34 ground staff to attempt to rebook all of us on other flights as they were not sure that the aircraft would be ready to fly the next morning complete chaos ensued there was virtually no communication between ca staff and passengers finally around 550 pm the last of us were confirmed on flights the following day they begrudgingly gave a few dozen passengers hotel rooms with no food allowance i lost 2 days in manila my final destination and was not offered any compensation for my prepaid hotel room overall a terrible beginning to a trip
7521,copa airlines,2,go with a company with better reviews,i tried for 24 hours to check in but their website would not recognize my booking code i contacted my agency they confirmed the code was correct and said i would have to check in at the airport my flight was at 555 am leaving mexico city which is a confusing airport to begin with and i was only able to arrive at the proper terminal just after 5 which is not copaa fault however the people at the desk would not let me check in saying the gate was closed an hr before the flight left however i cant help but think i could have still made it i asked what i should then do and they gave me a number with the quietest assistant ive ever heard on the other end who was unable to offer anything close to help i went back to the desk to find it empty every other airline desk was staffed except for copa for a full hour and a half while myself and other people waited for help i eventually had to buy 2 new tickets as i was going to miss my connector as well and after buying them i attempted to check in for them right away after waiting inline for another 45 min after the staff finally came back i was turned away as they said they would not check in other flights until after they had finished booking the current on and to come back in an hr and a half i did and they had issues printing my boarding pass then a supervisor was required who was half an hour late finally after another 20 min i had a boarding pass with no seat registered i inquired and they said they had overbooked the flight and that there was no guarantee of a seat which would again mean i would miss my connector and have to buy a 5th ticket from them eventually i did get a seat on that flight however i will go out of my way to not fly with copa again their web site not recognizing a valid reservation code the non existent phone help the 1 12 hour pause with no staff at the desk the complete lack of any attempt to make any of the situation easier the complete lack of any sense of urgency and the possibility of missing a connector because of their ineptitude was astonishing if youre planning a relatively complicated trip i would go with a company with better reviews

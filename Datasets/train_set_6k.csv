14156,lufthansa,9,the trip was really good,i took a return trip from pl to us this april and the crew was amazing on the way there i had to call them to come as i had a problem with a passenger behind me crazy woman who had three seats to herself but wouldnt let me recline when i tried to the crew came and helped me deal with that on the way back the crew were smiling and very helpful the food was good on the way to usa worse on the way from usa but ive been traveling there for almost 20 years and that is always the case overall the trip was really good only tiny complain i would have is there space is little small on the a350
20891,transavia,6,doesnt allow for online checkin,the flight left before the scheduled time and arrived well ahead which is always great the aircraft was very clean and staff was nice but transavia doesnt allow for online checkin which given the circumstances makes even less sense than normal also lines for the paris flights were mixed
2888,air tahiti nui,3,we must respect distancing it is just impossible,food the food from a quality standpoint from tahiti to paris had nothing to do with being in business class seat comfort having selected a six abreast configuration on an ultra long haul flight it is just a no sense choice i was lucky enough to be seated on an aisle seat but for outboard pax on lh rh side it is just a headache to get access to the aisle this seat does not have enough personal belongings storage and feet area is just to narrow to have a great sleeping position lavatory the airline decided to lock the forward lavatory exclusively to crew it means 30 pc pax 30 pyc pax are sharing only two lavs near door 2 during these times when we must respect distancing it is just impossible this airlines needs to remember their revenue is coming from passengers
11472,insel air,7,insel air customer review,boncursxm it was my first time flying insel and i can say it was better than many other caribbean airlines flights on time snacks served after take off and no tax or extra bag fees the price was fair and some dollars cheaper than its competitors funny to listen the announcements in papiamentu only some thousands speak it well i give insel 3 and a half stars will fly them again
7901,cubana airlines,3,cubana airlines customer review,cunhavcun both flights delayed for over an hour and although service on the first flight was good the second flight was terrible try to avoid or just be patient
21026,tuifly,2,uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight,berlin to fuerteventura bad experience narrow seats almost no legroom uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight for the better seats you have to pay 30 or 35 euros although the tickets are not cheap catering is expensive and not good rude passengers pushing their sears back without asking and even reacting aggressively when you ask them to push the seat back in upright position long check in lines no inflight entertainment seats in left 11 row have no window
1253,air canada rouge,4,our experience was extremely disappointing,on our departure from mexico to return to montreal we were shocked to find that our seats were not guaranteed on our flight in fact when checking in at cancun airport we find that we dont have a seat the letters sby are indicated as seat by going to ask the question to the representative of our airline company while going to carry our luggage he tells us that we do not have a seat yet that we are on standby and that we will have to present ourselves 10 minutes at our boarding gate before boarding begins to check with another employee of our airline to ask them for a status report we were so frustrated with the situation and the lack of explanation from our airline the employee didnt seem convinced that we had a seat on the plane even though we had an outward flight and a return flight when we had booked our trip to a resort in mexico with our travel agent moreover it was not our first time on a plane we knew how it worked and we had never experienced such a situation so we headed to our gate and waited for the right moment even when it was time to go see the employee at the boarding gate she didnt seem to know what to say other than probably the system finally my partner and i were called to the gate and finally got seats on the plane so imagine arriving at the airport and learning that your seats are on standby first time in my life that i have lived this also it was not the first time we had flown with this airline on the other hand positive point all the flight attendants on the outward and return plane were very nice and professional nothing to say on this side unfortunately our experience with the airline was extremely disappointing our travel agent did not understand why we did not have a seat on the return plane
12553,jetstar pacific,4,already expected a delay,ho chi minh city to da lat based on previous flights on this route i had already expected a delay between 1 and 4 hours and i was right 2 hours delay so i tried not to stress myself not much announcement from the company like email sms even the captain did not bother to say something the checkin staff was friendly but they weight anything that moves be prepared they also retain your ticket and passport until your checkedin luggage is scanned you can checkin online and it is nice that they assign the seats together even if you did not book seats the plane was relatively new 2 years old
7827,csa czech airlines,6,unreasonably high prices,nice to prague flights are mostly on time smooth boarding and nice atmospohere in the aircraft a319 in good condition and clean real shame is that you dont even get free water on the board and everything is paid with unreasonably high prices bagage allowance depends on type of your ticket be careful prg to nce for example allows only 15kg tickets prices might seem a bit too high average european airline in my opinion
12170,jetairfly,4,my last trip on jetairfly,i have travelled with jetairfly about 8 times every time there were some issues most of the time involving my reserved seats that they unannounced changed very uncomfortable and no refund given every time they had a minimum delay of 25hrs the longest delay 5 hours all leaving from miami they did not announce this at any time desk people never gave correct answers i live 90 minutes from the airport they could have warned me by email every time i say this will be my last time but it is convenient for me because of the nonstop to brusselsmiami today i have a bigger issue with them i need to take my support dog with me and am not able to reach them by phone from usa neither they dont want to give an email address on top of all of it they raised their price 200 one way since last year it definetly will be my last trip on jetairfly
15147,nordica,7,legroom is more than okay,warsaw to tallinn our flight was in codeshare with lot polish airlines between our arrival and departure there were 55 minutes gate opens 30 mins before departure the ground crew worked very well so we could catch our nordica flight to tallinn with ease the seats are comfortable the legroom is more than okay bigger meals and drinks are available on purchase but they serve complementary drinks coffee tea water and snacks chocolate bar the cabin crew was kind and the cabin was clean
633,afriqiyah airways,7,afriqiyah airways customer review,brujnbbru with a stopover in tripoli there were some troubles with the inflight entertainment on our way to jnb there were not enough headsets so we couldnt use the inflight entertainment on our way back from jnb to tripoli the inflight entertainment in our part of the plane didnt work at all the food was okay and the cabin crew friendly its definitely value for money but there are some things to improve
9755,flydubai,4,few staff are smiling,flydubai used to be always the best option for me and my wife among the budget airlines where we use to get a convenient and quick service but now felt like it has been downgraded as a budget airlines we dont expect to get a premium service but always expecting to get at least a friendly and a professional behavior from staff but now thats also has been dropped massively only few staff are smiling and willing to help and thanks for those staff who are willing to help and support
19492,swoop,2,most dysfunctional airline,most dysfunctional airline to date pre check in not functional leading to long lines and poor support at airport over 90 mins to checkin to airline alone dozens of people left without service or luggage support no available customer service or consideration throughout booking process flights delayed 5 times every delay notice coming 20min after scheduled departure not worth any discount as once fees for luggage added up might as well have gone with one of the big three
2817,air seychelles,2,most unfriendliest youll meet,johannesburg to mumbai via mahe the staff in flight and at the airport must be the most unfriendliest youll meet for the entire flight of passengers theres 2 people at 1 counter doing the check in takes 45 mins for a flight half full the guy at the luggage scan asked us to make it quick as the flight is leaving as if it was our fault theres only 1 counter receiving check ins there is no time in transit youre shipped from 1 flight to the other there is no place to smoke but was advised by a guy that smoking in the toilet isnt permitted but allowed its the smallest airport ive been to with barely any facilities taking all this into consideration i see no reason why they should have an attitude flights itself are clean but outdated in entertainment if you not fussy this is a cheap alternative if you need to travel in some comfort pay more
7015,china southern airlines,7,seat plane and amenities are super clean,despite 11 hr gzakl flight time the whole experience felt only 4 or 5 hours thanks to excellent sleep made possible by 180 degrees lieflat seat the seat strangely enough isnt comfy when its in recliner mode much better in normal seating mode with leg restlumbar support adjustments the message function is awesome however the seat design isnt really for storage of bagsshoes the spaciousness of the seat is more for writing and putting many dishesitems etc nevertheless space is plenty in overhead locker the cz business class experience isnt designed for people who want luxuriousspecial flight experiences its more for passengers who want good products great chinese food and things that just work the seat plane and amenities are super clean the punctuality is outstanding the service is more on the practical and taskcompleting sides than those of emiratessingaporeqatar airlines great attendance efforts and politeness despite not being fluent in english the crew are very hardworking and proactive in helping people its remarkable that it wasnt too long ago since china southern resumed its normal ways of operation to have abundant numbers of staff seven even for notbig business cabin is quite impressive
15672,openskies,9,openskies customer review,dullesorly return checked in online used american airlines admirals club boarded on time and surprised at condition of aircraft and seats flight attendants were helpful and during a delay served additional beverages meal was good our return flight was no different icare lounge was spacious with food and beverages to choose from the main meal on the return was lovely audio visual system it may not have been state of the art but worked well with much to view
17828,shaheen air,3,shaheen air customer review,nl721 peshawar to jeddah 191112 b737800 midwest air flight time was 5am but it was 1 hour late and departed from peshawar at 643am flight catering was done in peshawar the food was not so tasty and the toilets were dirty staff were not friendly
3442,airasia x,6,changed my seat after takeoff,seoul incheon to kuala lumpur the check in counter only opened 2 hours before flight and the queue to check in was so long there were no self check in kiosk we were in the airport 5 hours before flight we were in a rush to catch up the flight as we had to take train to the gate after we boarded the aircraft and put our luggage in the compartment the aircraft was out of power due to problems with ground power unitgpu the pilot did an announcement regarding it but no estimation time given passengers were still boarding at this time with limited light and small aisle its really not worth it to pay for hot seats and having to face awful stuff but kudos to one of the cabin crew on the flight who saw me having difficulties dealing with crying babies and changed my seat after takeoff
23002,xiamen airlines,5,xiamen airlines customer review,hkgxmnhkg both legs fairly new 737 seat room and cleanliness ok substantial hot meal served for a 50 minute flight first leg on time smooth flight crew spoke only poor english but were friendly enough good attention to safety where mobile phones and seat belts are concerned return flight delayed 6 hours due to weather boarding 3 hours late followed by another 2 hours wait on plane food and drinks served then another hour almost in hkg while waiting for a gate
2939,air tahiti nui,5,air tahiti nui customer review,aklpptlaxppt in economy may 2014 air tahiti nui only have five a340 aircraft we flew on three of these all were different experiences the first leg aklppt was on moorea which had an upgraded interior and felt very new and fresh leg room seemed adequate for economy however as others have said previously the seat designer should be sacked the head rest is not ergonomic at all and causes discomfort the is also no lumbar support i packed the seat back out with pillows to help the crew were young friendly and worked the cabin non stop food on all flights was edible if not slightly odd the seat designer must have had input in the menu as well entertainment on demand comprised of about 10 of movies some recent releases and tv shows the second flight an 85 hr overnight flight from pptlax was on nuku hiva this aircraft was also retrofitted with the new interior however it felt older tired and there was a noticeable decrease in leg room despite us being in the same seat number on both flights the crew were a bit surly and disappeared after trolley service again the seats werent that comfortable due to the awful head rest and lack of leg room our third flight overnight from lax to ppt was on bora bora which has yet to have its interior retrofitted the seats were much more comfortable than the newer version in economy as they lacked the offending head rest but the entertainment is on the old loop system rather than on demand would i fly them again only if the price was right we scored half price tickets you only get what you pay for
2208,air malta,8,perfectly adequate airline,munich to malta good friendly service and on time arrival the aircraft was modern and i liked the random maltese facts painted on the inside of each engine when i first sat down in my seat the plane had been configured wrongly and my economy seat was in fact in business class once the passengers were all seated the crew reconfigured the aircraft and moved the curtains further up this meant that we couldnt see the screen displaying the safety and emergency procedures video the food was very limited and if we wanted anything more including coffee there was an extra surcharge overall though this was a perfectly adequate airline
342,aeroflot russian airlines,6,smiling and attentive cabin crew,moscow to helsinki with aeroflot relatively good flight waiting for checkin took 15min then it was very fast flight on time relatively comfortable seats legroom decent smiling and attentive cabin crew negative point the snack served on board was a sandwich with beef with no other alternatives airlines should make an effort to at least offer two options meat non meat
11741,ita airways,2,pathetic experience,this is my experience with ita airways on which i flew today i booked my tickets using ita airways website which showed a connecting flight from new delhiromebarcelona the layover was 50 minutes and my flight from delhi to rome got delayed by 40 minutes we landed at 840 am there was no preference given for unboarding the flight for people whose connecting flight was just 20 minutes hence the flight attendants could not care less there was no one available outside the gate to help us guide for the immediate onboarding for the next flight had the ita attendants been mindful of such urgency which was created due to delays by ita airways so many people would not have missed the flight i was given the next flight which was 5 hours after my missed flight and all that was compensated was a snack meal coupon no lounge services to rest after a 9 hour flight and a long delay in arrangement of the next flight pathetic experience the staff is unconcerned about the customers
956,air austral,3,air austral customer review,sydneyreunionmauritius not impressed staff sometimes quite rude one meal with drinks provided after take off soggy sandwich about half way and small snack before landing drinks few and far between we could go and help ourselves to warm drinks with no ice overall would not fly air austral again and would not recommend it return flight not better
6470,caribbean airlines,2,caribbean airlines customer review,flights from london to port of spain and return the plane on both flights was an old boeing 767 a very noisy machine probably purchased second hand with lots of malfunctioning items for example in both flights the in flight entertainment system was broken and entire rows could not either listen or watch the movies or both seats very dirty and one toilet ran out of water whilst on the flight from lgw to pos the cabin crew were professional and kind most of the return staff were rude cold and not professional food was in both flights below any good standard quality the breakfast was the worst ever in port of spain thanks to the mistakes of the check in our small group who specifically asked to stay together and was reassured on that was scattered all over the plane
1412,air china,5,onboard experience lacking,sydney to madrid via beijing ok for the price their website is very difficult to use their cabin staff only perfunctory and the onboard experience lacking the aircraft were reasonable with seatback screens but the movie choice was very limited and the system slow and hard to navigate especially with the oddly placed armrest controls my 777 screen stopped working entirely after 7 hours the flight attendants did not appear to be happy warm or welcoming their english was passable but their pronunciation poor so cabin announcements are difficult to understand beer is available on the drinks round but wine is only available with meals and they like to give you 13 of a cup asking for a second glass was not received well the meals were tiny taste was good but they sometimes served the same dishes twice per flight i booked a transit hotel in beijing both ways but the process was cumbersome even after i spoke to their call centre both ways it took 3 hours to get the transit visa and go through immigration and customs so be prepared the air china service desk is through customs at the door to the terminal the hotels were quite good but there was nothing nearby either of them if you have a very cheap fare and do not mind a long break mid trip in pek then air china are an option but other airlines will probably do the job better for not much more money
20895,transavia,4,seats are not very clean,we paid extra and booked the exit row seats which the transavia website said was possible if children 12 to 16 are accompanied by an adult however when we arrived at the airport we were told that we could not have the exit row seat as my son was 12 and that transavia had changed our seats to another standard row i told the ground staff that the website had indicated it was possible which is the reason for us booking this resulted in some confusion but we managed to get the seats that we paid for eventually this is the 2nd time that transavia had shifted us without consent and both times we had to rectify i think that shifting passenger seats without prior consent is highly unprofessional as this is preventing people from getting what they paid for onboard the exit row had decent leg room the seats are not very clean because they provided us with disinfectant wipes to wipe down our seats ourselves i saw the priors customers dirty disinfectant wipe still in the pocket of my seat
10791,hainan airlines,2,inflight the service is good,mexico city to beijing via tijuana booking the ticket was not easy with unfriendly website and selecting a seat was not possible until check in the flight was delayed for 8hrs due weather and mexico city ground staff did not help with the fact that it was a weather delay and this was not their fault inflight the service is good the flight attendants are attentive the inflight entertainment is outdated lacks variety and does not compare to other 5 star airlines the food was the worst food i have had the seats are okay
8863,ethiopian airlines,3,last experience was so disappointing,lom to new york jfk i used to recommend that company but my last experience with them was so disappointing like we say as long as theres no issue everything its fine as soon as you need them you realize that they are not professional at all they just want your money they will assist you call you to book your ticket but as soon its done youre not longer their priority i was flying from douala to lom then from lom to new york jfk 072522 they lost my bag and till today no bag no news from them i dont even remember how many times i tried to call them it just rings they dont pick up its like you calling a personal phone sometimes its better to pay more for a better service i cant recommend them anymore and am going to keep posting negative reviews on social media to warn people against company like ethiopian airlines
3515,airasia zest,5,airasia zest customer review,mnlbcd return you get what you pay for we got the early morning flight to bacolod only to find out the flight was cancelled had to go back home for the afternoon flight same thing with our return flight to manila morning flight out of bacolod cancelled hotel staff at bacolod informed us it is a usual occurrence such a big inconvenience if your vacation time is limited or you have to catch a connecting flight would rather fly with cebu pacific or air philippines
4817,austrian airlines,4,chaotic situation and delays,the staff is nonprofessional and do not have the ability to properly communicate with the customers with their poor conduct they create chaotic situation and delays
22195,vivaaerobs,1,doesnt have any type of organization,vivaaerobs doesnt have any type of organization whatsoever when it comes to luggage this is the 3rd time in the same month that they dont deliver it my destination this is very frustrating when you fly and dont have your stuff with you its a very unfortunate inconvenience
17595,saudi arabian airlines,8,will recommend them,individual experiences and preferences can vary but for me saudi arabian airlines are really trying in terms of customer service inflight care seat spacing for me its the best ill rate them high and will recommend them to anyone flying their route
21266,turkmenistan airlines,3,air crew were miserable,birmingham to amritsar via ashgabat with turkmenistan airlines flight time was moved forward by a few hours and we were not notified when we arrived at airport they were already boarding the aircraft fortunately we could still check in and did not miss our flight to india staff are a bit disorganised seats were allocated so couples sat on opposite ends of the aircraft which did not make any sense the return flight was due to leave at 9am but did not depart until later in the afternoon we were not provided with any refreshment or information during the long delay the aircrew were miserable no in flight entertainment and food was average to tasteless the curry spice foods are too spicy hot to eat if delayed for 5 hours they should have at least provided fresh water and sandwiches in the airport free of charge no apology partial refund or refreshments were given
480,aerolineas argentinas,1,aerolineas argentinas customer review,flew four times over the course of a month internally around argentina ezeel calafate el calafatetrelew treleweze ezeiguazu and was very happy with service check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at eze to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 7377 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the 800 id certainly recommend
14465,malaysia airlines,3,another poor showing by mh,on boarding this flight 30 minutes late i was told i was being moved from economy 4d to 15d being one world emerald actually my home airline is mh i would have expected to be at least moved close to my original row instead i was told no more seats change of aircraft type your row is 4 which would be business in this aircraft sitting front row economy is my usual meeting has to attend i was fairly rudely ignored by the ground and aircraft crew 15d had a bust armrest and a malfunctioning tv screen my 2 pieces of clearly marked priority and one world business class came out las again another poor showing by mh i supported this airline through the pandemic poor understanding of customers
4872,austrian airlines,1,i will never go back with austrian,bad service uninterested crew it was a flight from amsterdam to vienna to sofia may 22nd 2022 the first flight was delayed with 15 hour no information given during the flight we heard that the connection to sofia already left in vienna no help at all they didnt care that you missed your flight no one to help or to guide you go there go there that was it at all the desks i was accused i was too late eventually they rebooked me on a flight from 0400 pm after boarding there were some computer problems waited for one hour no information given then they told us the flight is cancelled and we had to get off the plane again and the crew had the nerve to tell us to have a nice day and see you back soon back at the airport uninterested staff told us that there were no flights anymore that night they could give me a hotel and the next day with lufthansa to paris and from paris to sofia i checked the internet there were also direct flights to sofia in the end i could go with a flight from 0900 pm that night because they put me on a waiting list but only after i did not accept their offer for a hotel i had a 16 hour journey instead of a 5 hour journey that day because of the incompetence of austrian and again the worst thing was their lack of interest they gave me a feeling they didnt want me as a customer they only want my money no service or compassion at all needless to say i will never go back with austrian
9524,firefly,8,firefly customer review,1312015 firefly from penang to krabi on time with boarding with little fuss soya or fruit juice and peanuts were refreshments offered which was enough for the short flight great to connect so easily between the two points of penang and krabi

11129,horizon air,5,horizon air customer review,yvrpdx check in a breeze and a small aircraft think it was a 28 seater got a drink and a few snacks as well crew on board were fantastic and a great flight seats were comfy
22267,vlm airlines,8,offered reasonable prices,work required me to go on very short notice to london so i decided to fly with vlm which offers you three flights per day from antwerp to london city with their fokker 50 decided as well to fly from antwerp as they offered reasonable prices for their flights while my usual airlines i usually take from amsterdam or rotterdam were extremely expensive for just flying of less than a hour arriving a touch early at antwerp airport checkin and security were quite quiet so it was just a matter of a few minutes to pass both checkin and security while waiting to board very small airport so dont expect much to do after security once the aircraft was ready to board it was just 15 minutes to be fully ready to start up and depart the fokker 50 they were using was surprisingly neat and clean from the inside for an aircraft of this age and was quite spacious to stand in the aisle after an ontime departure out of antwerp the flight was quite smooth and the flight attendant started to serve us with a complimentary drink and snack of your choosing while the flight crew kept us up to date about their procedure into london city and the estimated time of arrival which to me was well done turbulence appeared into approach of london and landing was ontime the most surprising factor of the flight was that the noise was quite low for a turboprop within the cabin after a ontime landing the boarding was quickly done in a safe and mannerly matter and all that was left was to wait for our luggage to arrive on our belt which probably was the longest wait
16771,rex airlines,3,in melbourne was utterly unhelpful,rex staff at melbourne airport were appalling when i visited them to check in the day before my flight the lady who attended to me first in melbourne was utterly unhelpful her colleague seemed to realise that i was being misadvised and so the other rex person stepped in and completed what was required to be done on the day of my flight i needed help re carrying my bigger bag next time i will make sure i have a bag with wheels but the rex personnel said that they could not help me with that until i had been through the check in area yet adelaide staff in rex did help when i was in adelaide earlier i use an aid to walk and i am elderly and i was flying solo rex staff at airport were negative when i asked if a trolley or something after i had gone through checkin to help me to carry the bag i asked if that was possible and i got no where i did not know where to go to wait for the plane and was told i should go back where i came from to the rex staff so different to the rex staff in adelaide after letting a man in the area where one goes through the xray that i did not know how far the walk was nor where to go he was completely disinterested if i started walking and chose the wrong way i was worried i might miss the plane he utterly disinterested told me if you miss your plane you can try to get a refund i felt worried and distressed eventually another person did help me and it was a long walk much longer than i anticipated to the correct area i thanked that person who was not a rex employee i had told the rex staff the day before that i thought i would need some assistance re getting to the plane yet was that request not documented because on the flight day they blamed me for not having asked earlier for assistance i clearly did say the day before that i would require assistance the rex staff at melbourne were not kind not interested not understanding and not reassuring only at the final moment just before boarding and just before she finished her shift for the day did a very nice rex lady come over to me and she advised that she had arranged some help for me that was good buut when i arrived in adelaide no one on the plane had arranged for me to get help with getting my heavier bag out to the taxi as no one had been asked to arrange that fortunately another person one of the air hostesses on the plane stepped in and suggested i wait until the other passengers had left the plane and then she would get me a person to help i appreciated her understanding i cannot understand why for the same airline that staff in one city can be pleasant and helpful while their colleagues in another city could not care less
6260,bulgaria air,9,flight was very pleasant,sofia to amsterdam i flew with bulgaria air last april at the gate the stewardess that was checking the tickets told me i got a upgrade to business when we entered the plane a a320 around 15 years old we were created i was seated at the second row of business class at the seat a bottle of mineral water when we reached our cruising altitude the stewardess came with the food for the business class we had a traditional bulgarian breakfast with banisa yogurt and some fruites it was very tasty the flight itself was very pleasant after landing in amsterdam the stewardesses said good bye after disembarking
6757,cebu pacific,1,this is just mind blowing and appalling,this is the worst airline i have encountered and i travel extensively their policies are deceitful and customer service is not willing to help or even explain their policies at all i went to check in for my flight and had already paid for my bags when i had purchased my flight when i checked they were charging me an additional 4000 pesos for my bags which i never even selected when i brought this error up twice with customer service they said they could not help because i did not screenshot the error of course i did not screenshot any error because that amount was reflected on my account without me doing absolutely anything even worse they just told me that if i did not settle the balance they would not let me board the flight this is just mind blowing and appalling
2551,air new zealand,2,do not ignore your customers,i am appalled by their lack of customer service i purchased an air new zealand flight through edreams back in may 2021 the flight unfortunately had to be cancelled due to border entry restrictions due to the covid outbreak i have from july last year to present day been fighting to get my money back all 1900 euros of it i contacted edreams they tell me they are waiting for the refund from air nz i contact air nz they tell me edreams holds my money i now have an email proof from edreams to say that they are still awaiting a refund from air nz which i have now sent to the customer service department but i doubt i will get any answers because they blatantly ignore all emails i send if you are selling your flights through a scam company then you are just as much responsible for fighting our case because the flight your companies flight was booked in good faith and the matter of the refund needs to be sorted do not ignore your customers
655,afriqiyah airways,3,afriqiyah airways customer review,gatwickaccragatwick and found the journey up to expectations on time both directions and the onboard staff very attentive without being fussy the letdown was tripoli airport on arrival from gatwick very scruffy and downatheel and staff bullying passengers into line for us to obtain boarding cards for the tripoliaccra leg of the journey information was less than brilliant too the return transfer was a better but thats probably because i knew what to expect afriqiyah airways are good value in my opinion
11927,jazeera airways,4,jazeera airways customer review,beirut kuwait jazeera plus cabin groundstaff rude and inefficient my luggage arrived as one of the last pieces in kuwait airport rather than first off cabin crew friendly and attentive food free jazeera plus cabin is comfortable toilets were clean and food tasty
14351,lynx air,4,delay hours before we even checked in,it was a good price however we were informed of a delay hours before we even checked in ridiculous would have been better if they serve at least some snacks
9192,eva air,3,service onboard was okay,bangkok to vienna on 22 march ticket booked could not check in no customer support desk open only mon fri could not choose seat even though was in tariff from ticket service onboard was okay and staff good flight on time flight changes random due to coronavirus and little support and as no more premium economy on route vienna to bangkoki will be flying with a different carrier
14939,nam air,7,very happy with the service,flew nam air from sorong to jakarta on flight no in587 the check in process was fast and efficient with very friendly staff we took off on schedule and arrived in jakarta ahead of schedule my luggage came out within 10 minutes of landing and was handed to me by nam air ground staff the cabin crew were very friendly and i was very happy with the overall service provided by nam air and would certainly fly them again
3130,airasia,9,appreciate the thoughtfulness,flight attendant george was very considerate to promptly change available front seats for us upon seeing my elderly mother struggle to walk appreciate the thoughtfulness
7854,cubana airlines,2,i would not recommend,santiago de cuba to havana the representatives are very unhelpful and would not recommend to use this airline we had a delay from santiago due to faults in the aeroplane and they did not have any information about how long it would take we had another flight from havana 3 hours later but we were not given any priority or help the cubana airlines representative did not even want to tell us the name of the hotel where the other customers were spending the night until the aeroplane was fixed in the end the delay lasted 18 hours and we lost all our flights back home the airline did nothing to compensate for the flights lost and we had to buy new tickets to get back to top it all when we finally arrived in havana we spent 1 whole hour on the plane waiting for the plane stairs and a bus to take us to the arrivals horrible experience so make sure you have extra days to cater for any delays if booking with this airline
21144,tunisair,5,tunisair customer review,lhrtun economy very fast check in no queues probably hit heathrow at quiet period flights on time with clean modern aircraft a319320 comfortable seating with adequate leg room tasty hot meal both directions with complimentary beerwine crew friendly and could not fault any aspect of the flight
11166,iberia,3,any kind of service was painfully slow,the aisle space was so tiny i believe it could be dangerous in an emergency situation i couldnt even drag my small carryon suitcase through the normal way i had to turn it on its side the seats were arranged 343 a setup i havent even seen on larger planes its greedy and ridiculous in an emergency situation its probably downright dangerous we were packed in so tightly that we couldnt even get out without the person in the aisle seat having to move or bend over to pick up items on the floor my mom had pain and cramps the whole time from being jammed in so tightly the pa barely worked so no one could properly hear what the captain was saying and free wifi was advertised but only actually given to people in business and first class everyone else had to pay extra if they wanted it any kind of service was painfully slow probably due to the small aisles however the food was actually very good and the entertainment selection wasnt bad we also werent sent our boarding passes until a few hours before the flight causing unnecessary anxiety additionally we were forced to wear our masks for an 8hour transatlantic flight according to the cdc wearing a mask while sleeping can be hazardous to your health and thats just what most people like to do on airplanes especially long flights if you want to feel like a human being and not a rat in a sewer dont fly iberia unless youre getting business or first class
13743,liat,8,uneventful flights,i had two straightforward uneventful flights with liat on 11th april 2016 the anu to bgi flight was about fifteen minutes late and the bgi to dom flight was about half an hour late checkin at v c bird was quick and efficient while luggage was delivered promptly at grantley adams then checkin at grantley adams was also quick and efficient while luggage was delivered very quickly at melville hall from getting off the plane at melville hall to leaving the airport took no more than twenty minutes staff on the ground at all three airports were highly professional and very polite and the same can be said of the cabin crew on both flights if liat could replicate these standards on all their flights then there would be little to complain about
5252,bahamasair,2,lacking in professionalism,just as most of the other reviewers stated bahamasair is just so lacking in professionalism but there is not much competition so they continue to perform without caring we sat in marsh harbor this past sunday for seven hours waiting for our flight to west palm beach to show up no explanation and no help from the airline employees to be fair they did give us an 8 voucher to be used at the airport caf of course we missed our flight out of west palm to boston no help given to us for the inconvenience just so frustrating especially when checking in to the holiday inn west palm to find other airlines distressed passengers with credit vouchers to be used for foodhotelexpenses also our flight to marsh harbor was delayed but only by one hour which i think is great for bahamasair hardly worth mentioning we love the bahamas but will have to avoid them in the future if bahamasair is the only option
23086,yakutia airlines,6,yakutia airlines customer review,i took the weekly yakutia flight from magadan to petropavlovskkamchatskiy at 446 it was an expensive flight but saved a lot of money and time compared to the alternatives the experience is probably best described as nostalgic the safety cards proclaimed that our aircraft is fitted out with modern and reliable equipment but aside from new seat covers it appeared that their definition of modern extends back to 1974 safety cards appeared to have been written for a different aircraft lifejackets were not under the seats they were stuffed into the seat pockets seat pitch was good at 31 inches cabin comfort was not great no ventilation and the seats were very worn and uncomfortable but the flight was not full so there was room to spread out the sole fa was efficient and helpful and a snack box was served no meal trays though the sliceyouintwo metal meal trays were absent here the flight was generally smooth and departed and arrived on time one final surprise was that on arrival passengers collected their own bags from the aircraft hold handing over their aeroflot soviet airlines claim check before boarding the bus to a gate in the fence next to the terminal building
10349,germania airline,4,should have chosen lufthansa,friedrichshafen to gran canaria flight was cancelled due to a desert storm in egypt so they said theres no aircraft at friedrichshafen so they took us to zurich by coach new airplane old reservation unvalid of course we then arrived 3 hours delayed at las palmas with germania swiss when we ask them about compensation and demages they just said its another carrier and the desert storm has been a higher force however staff and food was good flight back was also delayed about one hour we should have chosen lufthansa from munich
3134,airasia,8,the best value for money,they deserve the title of best llc in se asia they have been doing this a long time and still they are the best value for money with the best routes
10113,frontier airlines,1,has been the worst flight experience,we booked a flight straight back to cincinnati and this has been the worst flight experience dont ever fly with frontier we knew they were bad ie dont offer food for a three hour flight unless you pay dont let you have a jacket inhand unless you are carrying it but they were incredibly cheap so against our better judgement we booked it it got delayed for 2 hours and as were in line we get an email saying its cancelled do not fly with frontier
16565,qatar airways,9,appreciate the good and warm services,i appreciate the good and warm services provided by every staff ground and cabin they make this my journey comfortable and relaxing the money is worth it the food and beverages were good too the flight time is right on schedule thanks qatar airways
20716,tigerair australia,6,overall couldnt fault them,darwin to brisbane was hesitant about flying with them but given how cheap the tickets were i decided to give them a go overall couldnt fault them we left on time landed early and had no dramas despite it being a full flight service was what i expected courteous and polite i am a larger person so the seats felt fairly tight but i expected this and it wasnt too bad there was no wifi or onboard entertainment but i had my own ipad and had downloaded movies for the trip so didnt mind would i fly with them again absolutely especially with how cheap they were compared to other carriers
7816,csa czech airlines,9,i was pleasantly surprised,prague to seoul i was pleasantly surprised about their service everything went smooth from checkin to landing food was fresh and tasty crew was very nice and helpful i did not use the inflight entertainment system much but airshow and music selection was good one let down is that the system is not in czech we were provided with pillow and blanket plus bottle of water which was very nice as i did not have to ask crew whenever i was thirsty both flights departed more or less on time and landed early i wish their service would be so good on all of their flights
886,air astana,8,significant improvements,st petersburg to bangkok via almaty there has been significant improvements to this airline in the fourteen years since i first flew it was a day service between st petersburg and almaty on a clean a320 seats were comfortable spacious and with a reasonable recline food was good and well presented in flight entertainment was on tablets and there was a reasonable selection cabin service was a little hit and miss i asked for wine with my meal and by the time i realised that it had been forgotten i had finished and did not ask for it the cabin crew spoke reasonablegood english but only spoke to me in russian because initially i had spoken to them in russian the check in in st petersburg was fast efficient and in english they had a bus for business class passengers to go to the plane the flight departed and arrived on time and my luggage was among the first offloaded in almaty the almaty bangkok sector was a night flight on a new dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 230 am check in in almaty was slow because the operator was dealing with problems for a couple of economy class passengers it would have been faster to use the economy check in counter food was good and the seatbed was comfortable and there was quite a selection of in flight entertainment i was identified as a foreigner and so spoken to in good english the plane left and arrived on time and again my luggage was amongst the first off the plane
1961,air italy,5,air dolomiti worked okay for us,munich to bologna and pisa to munich both on an embraer 195 economy both flights handled efficiently southbound on time northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight there had been thick fog at muc early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning however support given to those with tight connections modest inflight service snacks and drinks wine came in proper glasses air dolomiti worked okay for us
19968,thai airasia,5,there is miscommunication,nagoya to bangkok mostly my review is concerned to ground operation service in nagoya airport as my flight was cancelled due to flight cancellation ground operation of thai air asia in chubu centrair nagoya intl airport could not be handling this incident properly as there is miscommunication between airline and shops at this airport for meal voucher redemption a meal voucher has been provided for passengers once i got and straight away to redeem it as it was 2130 hrs i went to subway they rejected this airline meal voucher and i went down to lawson they also rejected finally it was a miscommunication between airline and shops
17598,saudi arabian airlines,7,i would fly with them again,booked this airline as it was the cheapest return flight to bangkok went to drop luggage off as already checked in online went to business class counter and told her i had already checked and she soon changed her attitude lounge was okay nothing too excited the on board chef introduced himself and came round with arabic coffee and dates which i found to be a nice way to start the flight the seats were private and i slept well throughout 1st leg crew was very attentive and smiling dine on demand did not have my choice of desert 2nd leg crew was a bit reserved i was still full from the previous flight asked if i could just have the arabic mezze and fruit she seemed shocked surprised later asked for a tea she did not seem friendly but robotic 3rd leg crew was pleasant nothing to comment about 4th leg crew was pleasant ordered pancakes for breakfast with fruit yoghurt asked if i could have a bowl of fresh fruit as well but she said i can only have one or the other strange considering it was dine on demand and you could have what ever you want and at anytime you want i found the entertainment system to be minimal not offering much for the western traveller on film choices the rest rooms were not up to standard and maintained it was wet and paper was on the floor at times i would describe the lounge as being quite basic considering it is a new airport staff were okay pleasant enough nothing to write home about the shower facility was good especially with rainfall showers this airline is trying to compete with the big 3 emirates qatar and etihad they have a lot to do to be of the same standard especially with the crew and on board services i would fly with them again only because of their competitive price
7162,citilink,7,the best lcc in indonesia,citilink from kupang to surabaya on an airbus a320 checkin was quick and smooth the boarding process was fast and i was greeted by friendly cabin crew the flight departed a bit late but arrive on time the seat was quite comfortable for me overall i always enjoyed fly with citilink and will consider to fly with them again i think citilink is now the best lcc in indonesia
10833,hainan airlines,9,professional service standard,haikou to sydney this service on this flight is outstanding cabin manager is friendly professional and she provides help at the first time when i have a request the hai chef provided me with excellent meals on this flight the crew demonstrated a professional service standard
6161,brussels airlines,9,this flight was a real bargain,with 130 euros for two just hand luggage this flight was a real bargain i liked the fact that brussels airlines sticks to group boarding also disembarking is row by row and crew sees upon it adequate seating snacks at reasonable prices announcements in dutch french and english and an on time performance even with a delayed departure on the inbound flight didnt like the endless walk to and from the gate at brussels airport though but all in all very good
21584,uzbekistan airways,7,uzbekistan airways customer review,i went on a packaged tour to uzbekistan during october 2014 and i must say i was pleasantly surprised we flew from madrid to tashkent and the airplanes were new with your own video shame it only showed uzbek films and clean we had the rudest stewardess i have met their english is good the food was ok overall not bad we also took smaller flights inside of uzbekistan and they all left on time were clean the stewardesses were friendly and overall the experience was very good
17159,rwandair,7,value and warm hospitality,flew dohkgl march 2023 on a qatar airways award ticket the b737800 aircraft was aged interior was at times taped together flight on time check in and transfers was difficult as rwandair is less known by legacy carriers and even their qr partner could issue me a bp or transfer the luggage to rwandair onboard rwandair delivers good atmosphere fas are plenty attentive professional wellrested and accommodating eg allowing me for seat changes twice as i eventually found 3 seats in a row they are generous on supplies throughout this night flight at least 4 drinkrounds acceptable wines heineken beers and a liter bottle of water was provided to all food was again much better than most other airlines in economy i had my preordered special seafood meal served onboard as the first more foods including hot dishes could be requested the coffee served was a very good instant coffee from rwandan gorillas company entertainment shared with one tiny monitor shared by 9 seats no individual option headphone provided to those who wanted luggage delivered in kigali 2 days later upon my consent at the gate as time of short transfer had almost elapsed and the incoming qatar airways delivering the luggage had refusedfailed to relabel it prior to departure in kigali i had to go through pir reports and return to airport myself and pick the two items expensive tickets but the airline is recommended as they render value and warm hospitality
8719,emirates,1,worst traveling experience,worst traveling experience in last 20 years of business and leisure traveling they tried to force me to give my hand carry bag to luggage to do so they wasted my time asked me to stand on the side and made me go and talk to lot of different people they argue that i can not have hand carry bag and laptop bag separately to make the situation worst another ground staff at the time of entering plane stopped me and pressurized me to board the plane with just laptop bag which anyway going to be in my legroom on many occasions i paid extra and chose emirates for the service and comfort which seems to be a thing of a past from now on i will never choose emirates if i have an option
4465,anadolujet,9,definitely recommended,ankara to antalya the plane was relatively new with a nice interior coffeetea and a sandwichcake were coplimentary on a 50m domestic flight i was really impressed the seat was very comfortable and the cabin crew friendly all these for less than 20 euros with a 15kg luggage included in the price definitely recommended
20480,thomson airways,2,worst seat possible,thomson airways boeing 787 and the worst seat possible to have is 27c next to toilet might as well have sat in the toilet ever time passengers went to visit the toilet i was nudged with no room to get past this seat should be removed as very unsuitable flying for 10hours in a very cold cabin air con dripping above and crew using tissues to try to stop the water dripping onto passengers very disappointed with this aircraft
7357,condor airlines,2,expect an apology and a voucher,my wifes flight was delayed due to crew not showing up on time in addition to many other reasons she landed late in seattle and missed connecting flight was told by connecting airline to either get another connecting flight or get a voucher for hotel through condor help desk the girl sitting there at the condor booth was playing on her phone when my wife asked to help with getting hotel voucher or moving the flight earlier and her response was sorry i cannot help you my supervisor will be here to help you in 30 mins 30 mins came and other girls were there also there playing on their phones my wife came up to ask 2 or 3 other female employees who came to the condor help booth to work on the voucher so that she can get to the hotel with the infant as they have not slept for over 20 hours all their response was we cannot do anything and our supervisor is busy after over 1 hour my wife confronted these employees and and pressed on them to call their supervisor after over 1 hour supervisor came down and did apologize i expect an apology and a voucher
5387,bangkok airways,9,every flight has been excellent,krabi to bangkok this now is about my 10th flight with bangkok airways i have to say every flight so far has been excellent the flight attendants have always been very friendly and professional we always get a meal which is good quality even on the shorter flights the flights have all left on time or within 5 minutes my bags have always arrived with me every time we are in the region this is my go to airline
12055,jet airways,2,experience was not good,hong kong to london via mumbai the most uncomfortable and stressful connection ive ever experienced the first flight from hong kong was too hot and the second flight to london was too cold the juice wasnt juice just sugary orange liquid the movies are ok and seats were as expected the security in mumbai was very slow and resulted in nearly missing my connection although a very cheap price the overall experience was not good
12362,jetstar airways,8,i would recommend jetstar,from the moment we started boarding the plane at 1135am on 20112022 for a conference in uluru the flight attendant andrew had everyone laughing this continued throughout the entire trip which made it so much more enjoyable if only all flights had an andrew on them id feel so much more comfortable flying i would recommend jetstar because of this experience
17526,sata air azores,8,better leg room than some,i was concerned when i read so many poor reviews but if anything it prepared me for the worst which did not happen flight was on time check in a breeze plane was spotless and better leg room than some airlines i never expect fine dining on planes so i prepare by bringing some snacks in saying that the food was fine and they refilled your wine or beer free i also downloaded some movies on my ipad so we had our own entertainment perfect coming back the flight was delayed an hour due to an issue with the incoming toronto flight so you cant do anything about that they contacted me on my phone to advise me if the delay all n all a very good flight
3047,air transat,3,overall air transat experience was pretty lacklustre,while the staff on this flight were fine the aircraft and overall air transat experience were pretty lacklustre the plane felt extremely tired and dated no screens the usb outlets didnt work apparently this was the case for the whole flight the beverage options were tiny and the inflight entertainment system worked for all of 5 minutes and then stopped they charged 11 for headphones which people were unable to use due to there being no tvs etc this was a completely different experience from our other flight with air canada who had usb a and usb c outlets as well as standard ac outlets had the screens with a bunch of entertainment options movies shows maps the drinks were standard size drinks ie a full soda can well definitely avoid flying air transat again as it appears they cut costs in comfort
3299,airasia india,8,one of the best experiences,kolkata to bangalore amazing quality one of the best experiences i have had while flying just that there were not a lot of choices for food items a few flight merchandise were expensive otherwise its an amazing experience to fly by airasia
5262,bahamasair,9,bahamasair customer review,we had an excellent experience the checkin was prompt and efficient in fort lauderdale and freeport the staff were professional and helpful we felt the cost of the flights were high but they are usually cheaper than other airlines offering the same service
21924,virgin australia,8,the flight was uneventful,on checking in two hours prior we were told to come back as we were too early we sat and had coffee as there is not much else to do land side on checking in through the premium lane the staff member was checking in some of the 81 children school trip on our flight so wait we did no lounge in cairns apparently they used to have one boarding was efficient and we were welcomed on board warmly the flight was uneventful entertainment worked fine the chicken we chose was okay nothing special and the potato was gluey nothing as a dessert there should at least be a cookie
5191,ba cityflyer,9,ba cityflyer customer review,fralcyfra on excellent ba cityflyer what a pleasant experience flights in businessclub europe fairly lightly booked and very good value if one chooses carefully meals wine and close to ontime performance out of docklands which is such a classy little airport in downtown london made for such a better experience than slogging through heathrow i enjoy the smaller embraer aircraft and sense of personal service on ba cityflyer
12454,jetstar asia,2,the worst experience,da nang to ho chi minh city had the worst experience with jetstar and i do not recommend you to fly with them you get a short amount of time to checkin 2 hours they still opened 15 minutes too late they put you in a overcrowded bus you could not move an inch they had a full bus go to the airplane while i was waiting in the second bus i noticed another bus or the bus who got back from the airplane parking behind us i knew this bus shouldnt be overloaded the third had less than 15 passengers why didnt they just distribute them normally they had the bus stop in the blazing sun for several minutes now i made a mistake not carrying my ticket on me i gave it to my girl but right from the start this flight attendent put up an aggressive tone towards me and i told him sorry my girl who walked ahead of me is carrying it but he ignored what i said and repeated more aggressively sir can i have your boarding ticket so i went to my seat and grabbed my ticket he then walks to my seat and went off on me and i told him that she had it he said he didnt know instead of giving the ticket back in a normal way he threw it and walked away
21229,turkish airlines,6,ife is disappointing,food on the bishkek to istanbul leg was woeful it was an awful sort of mini ham and cheese sandwich food on the much shorter istanbul to amsterdam route was delicious however with chicken in a sort of yoghurt sauce crew on both legs were friendly ife is disappointing on turkish its a bit annoying having to board past business who are already enjoying their orange juices and canapes
17687,saudi arabian airlines,4,very disappointing,flight was on the runway for almost an hour before pilot apologised and stated that there was a technical problem that needed to be solved at the gate stranded in the aircraft ever since i had to ask for water and then a further round was given to us we are supposed to be 2 hours into the flight already on the way here the food offered was worthy of a budget airline waffles and a hard croissant for breakfast very disappointing for a skyteam alliance member
16850,rossiya airlines,7,rossiya airlines customer review,ledhel ticket much cheaper than the western airlines service not lower the plane was an old a320 with standard seats the flight was short they offered only sandwiches with water or orange the airport is not that great but it is not the airlines fault the building was old and unpleasant
6701,cebu pacific,4,till now i didnt get yet my baggage,i have connecting flight from dxbmnlrxs the flight was delayed for more than 2 hours when i reached to domestic flight transfer helpdesk one of the staff took my bagage and i go directly to departure entrance to get in on the flight to roxas when i reached roxas my baggage was left behind on the airport and they are saying i will get my luggage by the next day but till now they said my luggage is missing in manila airport till now i didnt get yet my baggage
15129,nok air,6,not a patch on airasia,first time on nok air as normally take airasia for domestic travel in thailand checkin was nightmare as they did not have my prereserved seat in the emergency exit and tried to charge me 300thb despite the fact i already paid this boarding from a remote stand through buses unlike other airline using an airbridge aircraft was tired an ex ryanair boeing 737 seat was uncomfortable and not a patch on airasia you do get a complimentary cup cake as a snack i will be using airasia for future domestic travel in thailand
8800,estonian air,3,estonian air customer review,tallinnlgw if you think of it as a low cost airline you wont be too disappointed even on a 3 hour flight food and drink had to be paid for although the prices were lower than some other airlines eg 3 euros for a beer the only real issues were that the seat pitch was very tight and the interior needed some maintenance eg some seat covers were torn
21315,united airlines,5,i have a major complaint with united,baggage handler broke off key in ignition to my electric scooter upon arrival in seattle was unable to help get it out and not useable in seattle during my vacation very inconvenient as a disabled person who relies on my scooter for traveling local repair shop got it out for me but had to order new key which i wont get until my return home first time i have a major complaint with united and intend on filing a claim for new keys
19987,thai airasia,5,curious mixture of positives negatives,my flying experience bangkok dmk to singapore with thai airasia was a curious mixture of positives and negatives airasia uses the older don mueang airport to serve bangkok this was convenient for me as it is located quite close to my hotel the rama gardens dmk was considerably more crowded and rundown since the last time i visited when it was bangkoks principal airport the checkin counters are not well identified with signs and i had to wander for a while and ask for guidance before i found the appropriate location the premium flex addon to the low dmksin base fare costs about 30 usd and gives the passenger several priorities including a separate checkin line preferred boarding more comfortable seating a choice of hot meals and 20 kg of luggage once located the checkin process was polite and efficient passport and security checks went reasonably quickly but the terminals air conditioning system didnt seem up to the challenge of the thai sun and the teeming crowds the boarding areas had more windows but with the great views of the active runways came even more heat the boarding process went smoothly i had chosen one of the hot seats the window seat in the forward overwing exit row except for these rows which were empty the flight was completely full i dont know if this is a common feature of a320s but the actual windows in these rows were so clouded with condensation moisture that they were essentially opaque another disappointment associated with these exitrow seats was that passengers in these seats are not allowed to purchase and consume the wine and beer that is sold onboard the hot meal i had preordered was actually quite tasty but it would have been considerably improved with a singha beer or two our departure and arrival were punctual the crew were efficient and courteous and the flight was smooth and uneventful despite the fact that my suitcase had been tagged for priority handling it was the absolute last bag to appear on the luggage carousel several minutes after the last bag sign had appeared given the opportunity i would certainly fly with thai airasia again particularly now that i know the pitfalls to avoid
20198,thai lion air,2,booked with airasia instead,yogyakarta to bangkok via jakarta checking in luggage will cost you much more than the airfare i checked in at jog and was told check in luggage is not included and have pay 22k idr kg 160 usd i arrived in jakarta and had to recheck in for my flight to bangkok i was told check in baggage is not included and the policy had changed as of jan 15 for this flight i was required to pay 224k idrkg 16 usd the airfare was 18m 130 usd cost of checking in luggage 39m 282 usd 217 more than the airfare i ended up walking away from the flight to bangkok and booked with airasia instead part of the problem with not foreseeing these issues is lion air does not accept western credit cards and i had to go through a 3rd party site for booking after going through this experience there is absolutely no way i would ever fly with this airline and stick with airlines you can book directly with so there are no surprises
4214,american airlines,3,ludicrous flight connection system,many passengers on my flight missed their connecting flight due to delays we were delayed at least 40 minutes taking off several passengers in front of me knew as we waited to taxi to the gate they had already missed their connection the pilot and staff were great the issue is simple to me flights that dont run within 15 min earlylate run a huge risk of causing passengers to miss connections the pilot was transparent in tell us they were assigned to a gate which was occupied then assigned to another gate which was also occupied so we waited on the ground about 20 minutes for an open gate dont airports have like 900 gates i find it ludicrous that the delay was made even worse by the inability of the airport charlotte to find a gate i have a layover so i wont miss a flight i guess this review is on behalf of my passengers missing connecting flights the ludicrous flight connection system and the entire system itself i dont want excuses about pilot shortages luggage handler shortages import vibration etc for 550 for a flight from pa to al figure it out
15215,norwegian,1,was disappointed with everything,ble skuffet med alt fra nettside og ansatte p flyplass osv ville kjpe cabinbagasje og prvde gjre det bde p nettet og via appen uten hell mtte betale mye ekstra p flyplssen for en liten bagasje som ikke veide mere enn 7 kg was disappointed with everything from website and airport staff etc wanted to buy cabin luggage and tried to do it both online and via the app with no luck had to pay a lot extra at the airport for a small piece of luggage that weighed no more than 7 kg
8073,dragonair,8,dragonair preferred to cathay,beijng to hong kong with dragonair very smooth flight on time which is not easily expected for a flight from beijing where there is always problems with traffic restrictions or weather there is nothing to write home about for any economy flight as such but it is good that bottled water is provided at each seat not provided by parent company cathay pacific and hot items available at breakfast service is adequately good it seems that dragonair flights are preferred to cathay and i hope now that the airline is renamed cathay dragon the service standards will not change as i feel dragonair is better particularly for meals
15953,philippine airlines,2,enduring yet another delay,sitting in iloilo airport awaiting our seventh flight of eight in the last 4 weeks enduring yet another delay all previous flights have been delayed 30mins minimum 6 hours longest or cancelled clearly not capable of conducting a proper timetable the hassle far outweighs any joy in getting to the destination basically just a low cost airline unfortunately for the philippines all the other carriers are no better
21860,virgin australia,7,hasnt credited my miles,good flight and good crew there was nothing special on this flight but it was just a short flight while the seat was ok for such a short flight the aircraft should get an update though unfortunately virgin australia still after 5 months hasnt credited my miles to my qatar account and is ignoring my emails to customer service strangely virgina australia doesnt allow people living outside of australia to open a velocity account that made me wonder if they just dont appreciate business with tourists
17001,royal brunei airlines,5,lack of consistency disappointing,bangkok to melbourne via bandar seri bagawan youd swear this was a different airline it started ok though check in was quick and we had an express pass through security and immigration which was a blessing we had a pass given to us for the air france lounge oh my trying to find this was a huge challenge they really need better signage in this massively large busy airport fortunately the lounge wasnt far from the gate the flight to bandar seri bagawan was unremarkable nice food and comfortable on arrival in bsb we walked to transfers to be met and told our plane was in the uk with a cracked windscreen and that our melbourne flight was postponed the staff were very good and had pre filled immigration forms for us walked us through there and put us in a taxi to a hotel for the night with a voucher for a meal there the same taxi driver met us in the morning and took us back to the airport went to the lounge for breakfast and eventually a plane arrived we heard it came from jeddah the flight home however was disappointing there were only nine of us in business yet staff were hard to find they seemed to run to the back a lot we were told brusquely get your trays ready meals will come soon we got the first and second course then nothing pillows were distributed no duvet entertainment was extremely limited it felt like a different airline to our outgoing experience i did ring the call bell for a tea later on nothing was ever offered during the flight the lack of consistency was disappointing overall we arrived finally our bags were not long to arrive
10263,garuda indonesia,2,im getting disappointed,osaka to jakarta more im using garuda indonesia the more im getting disappointed airplanes parking is so far from the gate at osaka dirty toilets broken door to toilet price isnt worth it
15849,pegasus airlines,3,three days for delivery of my luggage,preflight and during were fine average what you expect from a budget airline upon arriving in istanbul i found out my luggage wasnt there because another flight came in in 2 days i had to wait three days for delivery of my luggage customer service and communication were okay contact couldnt be done through email though pegasus airlines desk at the airport told me it was the mistake of the luggage handling company at the airport i was flying from however the luggage handling company told me it was the other way around to save time i didnt take it to court

13544,latam airlines,1,the worst possible experience,i checked in with my daughter for flight la6012 at 540 pm from asu asuncion arriving at 830 pm in buenos aires aep the flight was delayed the airline claimed bad weather and left late at 625 pm scheduled to arrive at 2121 pm the flight was diverted to uraguay we were kept in the plane for about 2 hrs and then flown back to asu arriving back where we started around 1130 pm they claimed this was due to bad weather in buenos aires according to arrivals at buenos aires aep flights ar1645 ar 1227 ar1505 all landed on schedule at aep at 2125 4 mins after our flight was due to arrive 2100 and 2015 four other flights landed between 2030 and 2105 later than scheduled the airline did not book us into a hotel they did not provide food they simply said to return at 630 am for another flight that flight confirmation has not come through so i am worried i have to spend the night in the airport with my daughter this is outrageous communication has been very poor no one has looked after us the worst possible experience
21951,vistara,5,happy to be back in the air,vistara has for some time been the benchmark in indian aviation with amazing service and attentive staff unfortunately due to personal issues i was unable to fly for the last 4 months of so and was happy to be back in the air for a trip to delhi on vistara i blocked the first row of economy class since the fare difference between economy and premium economy was quite high for the travel date while the ground experience remains consistently good pre and post boarding the inair experience in economy has been quite degraded for a morning 6 am flight vistara did not offer teacoffee in economy class the breakfast was very poor and my omelette was inedible no condiments except a small roll and butter on offer now coming to the club vistara program i called up vistara 2 weeks prior to my flight as i had 2 upgrade vouchers and wanted to use one and asked them to recommend a flight on which i could use my upgrade voucher any flight and ok with either eco to prem eco or prem eco to business and i was told that no upgrades available even 2 weeks before flying imagine my surprise that i could see at least 23 empty seats in premium economy in the flight i was traveling in
15525,oman air,6,service on flight not so good,dubai to salalah the service on the flight was not so good crew did not seem at all interested in serving passengers they need to be more professional in their behaviour
16994,royal brunei airlines,9,definitely worth the extra,got upgraded via the online offer system paid just under 12 of the fare to fly business class so i understand that my review is not for the full fare on this route this was my only experience flying anything besides economy class so i dont really have much to compare it too upon boarding i got the rearmost row to myself as there were only three other people in the cabin the most noticeable thing was the lack of an ife system in the seat instead you get given an ipad in a rather nice rb branded case with a selection of films and tv shows the quantity of content wasnt as comprehensive as emirates or qantas however what was there was good and easily enough for a 2h flight might be worth mentioning that the particular episode of a tv show i ended up watching was censored pretty heavily ive seen lines being cut before but it makes you wonder what the point of having a show like that is if most of the comedy has to be cutblurred out the main point i would like to really commend on is how welcome i felt as a backpacker who just wanted to try business for the experience on the cheap i really appreciate how despite obviously not belonging there considering how well dressed the other passengers were the cabin crew made it seem normal and relaxing even though i didnt get to use the lounge in singapore it was definitely worth the extra for that flight however the economy on their a320s isnt too much of a downgrade for me at least especially considering it would have been nearly 3x cheaper than the full business fare
14154,lufthansa,3,everything extra is now charged,lufthansa has now become the european legacy carrier cutting costs to compete with the growing low cost carriers nearly everything extra is now charged checked bags seats food etc to change flights sometimes costs more expensive than buying a new ticket and from my past four flights with them none left on time they have announced a new cabin refurbishment i am skeptical
15631,onur air,9,onur air customer review,bristoldalaman return brs check in fine very fast got the seats we wanted comfortable seats enough legroom im 62 and could stretch my legs out snacks and drinks are a bit expensive but around the same as easyjet and ryanair attentive cabin crew several runs of the snack trolley arrived in dalaman early return trip pretty much a copy of the outbound arrived back at brs 30 mins early would use them again
7788,csa czech airlines,3,flight time is just a concept,nice to prague from early in the morning one hour and twenty minutes of delay it seems like the new standard for this airline as it is one of the so many this year ok used to be a fairly good company but now flight time is just a concept and connecting in prague is like playing at the lottery hoping you will get the winning ticket
163,aegean airlines,4,very rude no negotiating and very aggressive,flight from athens to mykonos was great every part our flight from santorini to athens not so good the agent working at checkin at the santorini airport was rude angry and classless we had only a carry on that we checked once at athens we didnt buy anything and actually left our beach towels at the hotel upon checking in we were told that one of our carry on luggage was 2 kilos overweight and the other carry on was a half kilo over weight we tried to explain those original luggage did not incur any problems before we were charged an extra 50 euros the way she said it was very rude no negotiating and very aggressive i guess this is how they treat you when you are trapped on an island definitely recommend the ferry or another airline
21587,uzbekistan airways,8,uzbekistan airways customer review,tashkenturgench september 2014 very positive experience especially compared to experience on long haul services plane almost new with great legroom departure on time pleasant crew this route probably prioritised to impress tourists but hopefully the airline will upgrade the rest of its fleet to the same standard and ensure all staff this well trained and pleasant to passengers this means i could recommend hy for domestic services which use new airbus aircraft
1856,air india,8,food was top class,first time i am flying air india after take over by tata there was a noticeable change in counter service at both chennai and bengaluru cabin crew in the flight were warm and food was top class area where attention is required is toilet upkeep during the flight and the seat comfort
7170,citilink,9,cabin is totally clean,flying citilink from surabaya to bandung i didnt expect much with this the seat is very comfortable the legroom is large enough for my legs i could sit comfortably without adjusting my leg position the cabin is totally clean and looked very neat one more important thing is that the flight was on time
18247,singapore airlines,4,the service and staff was mediocre,its been a long while since ive flown singapore airlines and theyve consistently received accolades for their service even in economy class however i was extremely disappointed with their service especially the catering on board a 7hr flight from brisbane to singapore the aircraft was a new a350 and i had a nice bulkhead seat which allowed me to stretch out the inflight entertainment was quite good and the redeeming factor for this flight unfortunately the service and staff was mediocre and not warm or approachable as i remembered the food was just awful especially for a medium haul flight which consisted of meat and veggies just piled on top of gooey rice not even a salad or appetiser which they used to serve and a cold bun there was an ice cream dessert the washroom was filthy wet and sticky floor toilet paper in the sink even just after the first hour or so and clearly the crew did not pay much attention to cabin cleanliness unlike other airlines where ive seen crew inspect the facilities and do a bit of cleaning check in and baggage delivery was fine at the airport but this may be as i have priority status but overall very disappointed with how the quality of service of a reputable airline has declined so much
7314,comair,9,inflight service is very good,johannesburg to cape town on british airways marketed flight operated by comair check in at terminal b quick and polite as was security visited the domestic slow lounge which is very good with lots of food drink options boarded on time through gate d2 on to a decent clean 737800 seated in 1a which was comfortable drinks offered prior to take off departed on time once airborne service was very good food was okay a full breakfast served managed 40 minutes sleep before decent landed around 10 minutes early on to a bridge baggage off the belt quickly i travelled with comair 3 times over the previous week and find that both ground and inflight service is very good
11150,iberia,5,finally agreed to put us in a taxi,extremely disappointed with iberias customer service our flight from valencia to malaga was cancelled after we had already boarded im assuming for mechanical issues we were making a connection in malaga to go on to casablanca they offered limited options to us none of which would have happened until the next day they finally agreed to put us in a taxi for 35 hours to madrid arriving about 430 am and then departing about 1130 am we asked for a place to rest for a few hours the customer service personnel instead thought they were being generous by giving us vouchers to use for breakfast at any of the food places in the airport which proved to be untrue as most places wouldnt accept them i understand the mechanical problem was not their fault but they could have accommodated us with access to the vip lounge at no cost to them
3615,airbaltic,1,9 hrs on a overcrowded airport,baku to amsterdam via riga with airbaltic the flights were supposedly 6 hrs total it was 17 hrs no explanation rude staff at transfer riga they shoved me off with 2 vouchers for 2 coffee i waited 9 hrs on a overcrowded airport no lounge seat during first flight they were assuring me the connecting flight would wait not so they did not even offer water or some food as consolation handed in my claim according to eu regulation 2612004 airbaltic is accountable and should pay for my loss of time i missed out on a meeting on top of it no response whatsoever so now i have to hand in my claim to get this case settled
8855,ethiopian airlines,4,the services was a disaster,i had travelled with ethiopian airlines several times always wishing that the same thing that happened to me before will change but it didnt i travelled long distance with my kids and the 6 times i used ethiopian the tablets on the seat were never working a trip with a kid of 5 years old and a 1 year old is very hard they also never gave any play kits for the kids i asked many times and they just answered that they dont have any the light on the top was also on all trip on my face for 16 hours and it wasnt working as well and of course they couldnt do anything about the crew from buenos aires to sao paulo and the other crew from sao paulo to ethiopia were rude answering in a bad mood making faces between them and running and shouting at people it was just terrible i didnt travel with my husband so i expected some help from the crew but nothing happed when they saw me carrying my baby and bags and my other daughter was scared they didnt even try to help me the services was a disaster
6324,bulgaria air,9,bulgaria air customer review,just completed my 4th flight between sofia and frankfurt over a 6 month period how pleasant it is to be sitting in a real business class seat 2 x 2 with room to spread and not having my notebook screen crushed by the seat in front with drinks before takeoff and charming crew all flights without exception have been right on time operated with new a319s i only wish theyd operate the route more frequently so i could use them both ways

7331,comair,8,comair customer review,flew from joburg to victoria falls in zim ba check in was very smooth and efficient turns out the ba lounge is not open during the day and we were directed to a third party lounge which was very nice indeed better that the galleries lounge that ba operate we had to take a bus to get to our plane which was fine and efficiently done the plane was an old ba badged 737400 i suspect a reject from european operations but plane was clean and well presented we were given a choice of hot meals which i have to say was very tasty and well presented on the outbound leg the inbound was not quite as nice but still acceptable both flights were packed to rafters with not a seat spare but staff coped very well it would be good to see comair get some new planes as the old cast offs from ba are really showing their age now

9551,firefly,4,firefly customer review,penang to subang kl and back to penang flight was around 20 myr 5usd more expensive than mas or air asia however since subang is so much closer to the city i felt it was well worth it subang airport has been refurbished and is very modern in comparison to my first visit when firefly was founded new atr 72500 are also much nicer planes to fly than the old fokker 50 checkin was efficient and flights were slightly late boarding but made up time in the air and arrived on time the crew was friendly and efficient however not as welcoming as the mh crew firefly is a subsidiary of mh they served fruit juice and a small piece of cake for this 35min trip not bad and good value for money

4131,alliance airlines,1,i would avoid this airline at all costs,in booking this flight there is no way to purchase more than 15kg per checked in bag on the website then when you arrive to check in i was promptly charged an extortionate amount for the excess weight the ground staff were completely inflexible and only concerned about getting as much money from unsuspecting passengers as possible the service on the plane was nonexistent and i would avoid this airline at all costs
18379,sky express airlines,3,it is unacceptable that sports equipment has limitations,as a low cost airline it is good but it is unacceptable that sports equipment has limitations for a snowboard equipment the board should be only 110 meters the average height of the board is 140150 can someone explain this logic to me especially when they have flights to winter locations and you want to go and do winter sports
14678,meridiana,7,meridiana customer review,ive flown meridiana a few times now and have always had a great experience theyre certainly nofrills but for almost what it costs to fly from new york to la i can fly to naples nonstop and have a free checked bag food is good and airportinflight staff are always pleasant any kind of online or phone customer service is basically nonexistent so i only book if im sure of where i want to go and am ready to eat the cost if something goes wrong but with prices this low i wont complain

14909,myanmar airways,8,myanmar airways customer review,ygnpnh via rep flight was almost full meal service on ygnrep sector decent meal and drinks service no ife but the mingalabar magazine was interesting enough transit in rep was fine straight through to the international departure hall which has a range of shops and internet access second leg much shorter although a drinks run was provided lounge access at ygn 8 is total worth the cost flights on time crew friendly
17157,rwandair,8,hardly worth the extra costs,flew kgldoh 12th june 2023 on an award ticket from qatar airways the boeing 737800 aircraft was aged but clean and well maintained night departure departed on time luggage labelled and transferred correctly earlier i complained to rwandair that they had deprived lounge access to qr their partner gold card holders they responded swiftly in kigali and statusmatched me to gold on their own dream miles program enabling me to use their lounges eg in kigali their dream lounge in kigali is quite good though far from world class seat choice limited at booking but at checkin everything was possible was assigned seat in row 5 just after business class later i negotiated with the cabin crew to grant me one of their two occupied sections 3 seats in a row though next to toilets in the very rear generously they agreed upon some internal discussion as they would now have to squeeze while i could stretch out the crew were all great apart from the arrogant chief purser i had preordered seafood and was given a large delicious portion of two salmon steaks my name and a few details were handwritten on a sticker placed on the cover foil this sfml option is available on many african airlines which supersedes most other carriers drink rounds were frequent and wines were of fair quality ife was useless as monitors are few and shared thus no option apart from watching an american teenage movie seats are spacious and footrests helps pillows blankets headsets given to all recommended despite tickets are pricey on this sector business class seats are spacious but just recliners hardly worth the extra costs compared to economy

14716,meridiana,7,meridiana customer review,moscowbologna this is one of the very few direct flights from moscow to italy the checkin procedure was fast and the plane left on time plane was an airbus which i like more than boeing because they seem less noisy staff were nice and they served a drink and snack basic service but the price was more than ok however they only speak italian and english not russian which is a pity on a flight to moscow

8823,ethiopian airlines,4,upgraded seat which i never received,1 i paid for an upgraded seat which i never received 2 in addressing the air hostess and head management i was told we are full so sit down 3 the television screen was broken and i was told it would be reset 6 hrs later nothing and dont ask for ear headsets because they seem to decide when and who can have these are not handed freely 4 the staff chose to ignore general passengers when they ask for anything and often reply ill go look or let me see and never come back or just avoid getting to you at all 5 they rudely wake you up when serving anything and if you ask for anything additional they feel the need to blame you for not taking at the right time 6 staff were untidy i would think pride in what you do starts from appearance 7 this airline needs serious intervention and management needs guidance on handling staff and passengers 8 to top it off they must know they are a problem as at the end of the flight not one member of the crew was found at the door exiting and i came from the back of the plane so they had ample time to converse and say farewell to passengers as all other airlines do i suppose they knew what passengers would say to them and chose to go elsewhere
686,air algerie,3,air algerie customer review,my flight on 1st june from algiers to lisboa portugal was a nightmare the check in was extremely slow and the sequence of spot check was complicated all forms were in french and fortunately i knew some words but most of the guests got confused the aircraft was very old and food was lousily prepared the toilet was like a public noncleaned toilet for years seats were not comfortable and some could not be reclined but the captain and crew were nice particularly since they knew i was from vietnam and they talked in both french and english nicely appreciated when they found the lost wallet of my friend
6761,cebu pacific,1,worst ground service ever,the worst ground service ever paid for extra baggage of 20 kg apparently should be in 1 big luggage charged extra for having 2 small baggage or package it as one which is the same price will pay again going back she placed us in different seats as a family
8966,etihad airways,3,worst experience is t3 abu dhabi,its cheaper than emirates but by no means cheap all the planes are quite dated if i had paid for business id want my money back the food on our november flight here was the worst food ive ever had on an airline inedible the trip from istanbul where the turkish people have much pride was excellent from syd to abu dhabi and abu dhabi to athens foul i have always found the cabin crew to be polite so no dramas there the worst experience is t3 abu dhabi it has got to be the worst airport ive ever had the displeasure of using t3 is dedicated to etihad and the facilities are so substandard one toilet block for multiple gates with few toilets also downstairs so a big hassle then the security you pass through the usual security buy some water on way to gate and then it is confiscated at the actual hate wtf then you have to sit in gate and wait with no access to water why not put the vending machine inside the gate and whats the point of security if the check is disregarded and you have to be checked all over again at the gate only airline and airport this has ever happened to me this experience is likely a reason i will pay extra and fly emirates next time
18443,sky express airlines,1,will never use it again,santorini to athens my mom and i had a flight booked for 315pm we had a second flight leaving athens at 645pm the sky express flight was delayed more than 4 hours in santorni because of the day befores wind storm they did not tell us in enough time to get to athens via ferry or another airline they barely gave any information there were tons of other flights going out and my mom and i could have booked another but they kept saying we were leaving then by the time we left with no food my mom boarded with some chips the flight attendant said she had to put them away and she said she hadnt eaten in more than four hours the flight attendant snapped back and said she hadnt eaten in 5 hours she was extremely rude to my mom and this was on mothers day we missed out flight in athens and had to pay for a whole new flight no help was given and no money back our new flight was leaving the next day so we had to pay for an overnight in a hotel the taxi there and back to the airport and we didnt get our money back from the hotel in bucharest this airline cost us over 500 and no apology was given we will never use it again
13882,lion air,6,typical nofrills lion style,surabaya to jayapura via makassar flight left surabaya one hour late nothing unusual for lion air transfer in makassar went smoothly and we arrived in jayapura just that one hour late apart from the delay it was a smooth flight typical nofrills lion style
14071,lucky air,6,lucky air customer review,i flew 3 times with lucky air ctukmgkmgsyxhakkmg in fall 2013 when i was living in china overall experience i give a 610 the crew was okay and the service too 1 flight was delayed for 30 minutes due to mechanical problems out of the 3 flights otherwise cant complain its a chinese low cost airline for me so it was relatively cheap to fly with them so dont expect much i flew 2 times with an airbus a320200 and 1 time with a boeing 737800 the inside is basic no personal tv the lucky air magazine is all in mandarin but they give you a lunch box with snackswater bottle for free during my first flight i was told by the steward to turn off my mobile phone during the flight even if it was on airplane mode the crew speaks broken english but we can understand if you want to travel cheap in mainland china lucky air could be an option for you
19706,tam airlines,8,tam airlines customer review,we flew from heathrow via san paulo to lima and returned via madrid to heathrow during a package holiday to peru and i have to say having read some of the reviews that we had very pleasant flights the planes seemed new to me were clean and comfortable and the food not bad for airline food i was expecting the worse but all the tit bits i took just in case were not needed we even had snacks on the internal flights and free drinks so cant complain however i would advise taking your own supply of water as once dinner had been served and the lights dimmed for the over night flight we saw no sign of the cabin staff until breakfast the staff never cracked a smile though i cant say they were unhelpful they just didnt seem particular keen and friendly the only time we saw a smile is when they asked an elderly lady to move seats and then promptly sat an off duty air hostess in the vacated seat because there was an empty seat alongside a lesson learned if im asked to move seats i want to know why i wouldnt mind for a family to be together but not for cabin crew to have a better seat saying all that i would fly tam again i have certainly flown in better but i have also flown worse so if cost is an issue or its part of a holiday package then dont worry too much happily our luggage was fine by the way even though we had connecting flights once checked in at heathrow and on our return at lima we didnt see it again until the end of flights
3739,airnorth,6,airnorth customer review,dwntsv then gcadwn april 2014 flight down was direct on time and with good inflight service return flight via mt isa less pleasing mainly because the fas jammed us all together despite a number of rows of empty seats at the front of the plane i hate having to ask to move once seated and with carry on in the ohead lockers there was no need that i can see to stack us that way and it just left a bad taste in the mouth food on the return flights was similarly bad in the mouth 1st leg was a beef curry very boarding school type muck and 2nd leg described as a chicken wrap which turned out to be a beef wrap too bad if you were allergic and took a bite surprise
6599,cathay pacific airways,8,service is slow during meal,i had too many expectations of this company the product is not bad but is nothing exceptional for example cathay meal trays that contain everything starter main course dessert presentation its a meal tray difficult to present something appetizing emirates qatar and swiss to name a few 4course meal served one after the other with a nice presentation seat not bad but again nothing exceptional qatar airways is better cabin crew very nice and attentive staff however the service is slow during meals the food arrived 40 minutes after the tablecloth i wondered if the food was on the same plane or if someone had gone to get some the first served had finished eating while i was still waiting to be served the food is good plane modern clean i am happy with the 4 flights i made with this company will i fly with them again yes if the price is low for a standard price i will choose another company
20049,thai airways,4,meals have really changed from very good to basic,unfortunately the inflight meals have really changed from very good to basic the vegetarian option is now vegan only no choice so when i could have had the cheese butter omelette and the chocolate cake i was only given rice carrot and broccoli and two identical bowls of fruit the sandwich i was given later was cold mashed potato pea and carrot filling really awful
8893,ethiopian airlines,6,service quite messy on some legs,brand new a350 but with old 222 c configuration clean and modern cabin comfortable seat but with smaller pitch than older 777200er aircraft friendly crew service quite messy on some legs very poor catering except good beverages looks like economy class food with bigger portions a real shame to serve this to business class pax first time i had to decline it no traditional ethiopian food like in the past on none of 4 legs all flights on time new business lounge in add very spacious with good amenities and food options
6873,china airlines,1,comfortable and quiet,delhi to taipei service excellent and staff were professional food was far better than expected the plane was very comfortable and quiet after 8 hours plus of travel arrived to taipei flights seem to go quick
17148,royal jordanian airlines,3,windows locked into darkness,amman to kuala lumpur via bangkok service and food on my flight to kuala lumpur via bangkok was ok i could stay in the airplane during fuelling which was good the only disturbing thing was the dimmable windows they were just locked into darkness for the whole flight theres a reason why i chose a window seat so please let passengers enjoy the view sunrise and sunset
2158,air malta,5,2 hours flight is the maximum one would want to experience,air malta offers cheap tickets between vie and luqa both flights were on time although the seat configuration of the a320 is similar to their competitors they are still using very old seats that cause the feeling of having absolutely no room at all i think that is the main problem with air malta not sure if they are about to change that or invest into new planes but i would say a 2 hours flight is the maximum one would want to experience there is no real service except the salestrolleys so i was extremly surprised to see 5 cabin crew members on both flights instead of the regular minimum of 4 certainly not because of the work load their business class is a little joke theres not even a cabin divider so i was happy that i did not pay for a lastminute upgrade when available in the cabin the crew was friendly but most of the time all five of them were not visible on both sectors since their competitors on this route are even worse i would say that km is the best option our of vie for flights to luqa
8563,el al israel airlines,4,they did not show up on time,el al ask to be at the terminal at least 35 hours before the flight however they themselves did not show up on time and we just waited for hours to check in our luggage i also had issues with them in the past and they are very expensive
7439,condor airlines,2,i will not ever fly them again,i flew on condor several times when lufthansa owned it and was delighted they have since been sold to thomas cook and the experience was very poor for my flight from las to muc the seats are miserable there is so little leg room and im only about 58 i have never been on such a pitiful long haul flightand it is not inexpensive they charge for moviesreally and the change of planes in fra was a complete disaster no announcements or signage and no one knew we had to check in again or where to do so everyone was confused and angry i will not ever fly them again
8074,dragonair,9,smiles from cabin crew,wonderful flight and fantastic cabin crew we had just flown cathay pacific from adelaide to hong kong and then on going to beijing with dragonair brilliant service greeted with smiles from cabin crew very fast and caring about passenger safety comfort and top quality service very good food such as beef or fish or duck and all food presented piping hot and tasty great value in a clean fresh and well looked after aircraft well done dragonair we will fly again with you soon
20470,thomson airways,8,crew were businesslike,flew thomson manchester to paphos return in april flight left on time leg room slightly limited i am 5ft 9 cockpit announcements informative and the crew were businesslike but friendly enough i did feel sorry for the two crew members who had to deal with two parents and three children mid way down the cabin all of the children appeared to be under 5 they began causing havoc in the departure area and were rather a nightmare throughout the flight thankfully we were 4 rows back i pitied those immediately behind as there was simply no escape from the constant shouting screaming and general disruption fully appreciate that young families are entitled to a holiday as are the rest of us i have travelled frequently with young children and have always struggled to ensure that they did not disrupt fellow passengers the parents in this case simply had no control whatsoever over their children who were unruly and vocal continuously through a 45 hour flight the mothers response to their constant screaming was to shout back to their credit the cabin crew did intervene at an early stage even before the aircraft left the ground to ensure that dad who apparently planned to sit apart from his partner and the children for the duration of the journey took charge of one of the children this didnt make a huge difference but probably slightly eased the journey for those behind this was basically all that the crew could do but they did at least intervene and attempt some improvement without causing offence flight back a week later was on time and no complaints clear up of the cabin prior to landing could have been a bit more thorough but not a huge problem the most tense part of the return journey was nervously scanning the departure lounge hoping that the family from the outbound flight were not joining us on our return leg they didnt result
5407,bangkok airways,6,inflight service very reasonable,bangkok to male was a mixed experience the flight departed and arrived perfectly on time seat comfort was good and inflight service very reasonable the flight did not provide any ife or wifi food and beverages were reasonably good however it was a bumpy ride due to weather and they did not have the seatbelt sign on and at a specific moment we hit some moderate turbulence recommended anyway
4871,austrian airlines,9,an excellent flight,os858 from tlv to vie the flight had a delay of 70 minutes but the crew informed transparently and provided additional information about connecting flights to passengers with tight connections this information was also available for free during the flight using the austrian onboard wifi service boarding was smooth and fast and the crew were excellent a warm early dinner was served it consisted of a pasta dish warm bread and some cake for dessert all of it was well prepared and tasty all in all an excellent flight
14232,luxair,4,luxair customer review,luxcdg on a erj and back on new q400 as always both flights arrived perfectly on time checkin in a rush but unfortunately the ground staff wasnt the friendliest seats very comfortable with plenty of legroom on both types but the best of all were the tasty snacks they served during the short flights a very pleasant experience
10671,gulf air,2,gulf air customer review,i booked a short flight to go to frankfurt via bahrain big mistake my flight was forwarded by 6 hours without an option this doubled my flight time so i had to hang out for 6 hours in a small airport the staff at dmm airport was not too friendly i do not recommend this airline
14595,malindo air,2,did not provide any answers when questioned,flew singapore to kuala lumpur with malindo air i flew both ways on the same day and the cabin on both occasions was at least 30 degrees this is inhumane and they did not provide any answers when questioned all they did was to ask us to be patient throughout the flight everyone was fanning themselves but why didnt they bother to maintain their plane
5244,bahamasair,6,staff were very friendly,wanted to leave this review for two major reasons 1 the reviews i read about the company were quite outdated and was not sure what to expect and 2 the number of bad reviews created a wrong source of expectation prior to my flights my flight was a return one to havana cuba about 4550 mins flying time even though the feedback for bahamas air was quite negative i must say that it was much better than with other companies ive flown wizzair ryanair the only negative thing was that the flight was delayed about 40 mins in each direction which is not something uncommon with flights generally the staff were very friendly and for such a short fly they also served some snacks i must outline that the crew even went the extra mile since they dont offer hot beverages onboard but were kind enough to find some for us there was plenty of seats since the flight was half full i didnt experience anything mentioned in the previous reviews like bad customer service safety hazards during the flight lost or delayed luggage if this was something that might have been the case in the past seems that the airline significantly improved
3102,air zimbabwe,5,a nasty surprise at harare airport,harare to johannesburg with air zimbabwe tickets on air zimbabwe are not cheaper than other airlines at the airport you will need to pay an additional us50 per person than if you fly using another airline this is because air zimbabwe has not paid the civil aviation authority of zimbabwe caaz the taxes for past passengers so now the caaz obtains these taxes directly from passengers as they are about to leave if you fly ba or saa these taxes are included in the tickets also note that online ticket websites we used gotogate do not publish the additional us50 or any such information on their sites so that you purchase tickets through them only to receive a very nasty surprise at harare airport the flight experience on air zimbabwe itself was not bad
23076,xl airways france,9,xl airways france customer review,parissan francisco in galaxie class friendly service good food decent amenity kit and i liked the films on the video player the plane is older but comfortable enough and the service makes up for it the price for galaxie is comparable to premium economy and their service is far better than air france xl airways is a great alternative and im glad they are doing the parissfo las and nyc route good value for money they need to add a lounge for galaxie and maybe think about a loyalty program i will fly them again over af any day
5602,binter canarias,7,binter canarias customer review,fuelpa booked this as a part of a tui holiday package they booked me on fuelpa with binter and then on their own airline tuifly from lpa to muc i tried to check in at the binter counter in fue the day before staff reasonably friendly and efficient but not a lot of english skills they checked me through to tuifly to muc flight was delayed for around 35 minutes no announcement about delay was made when the late aircraft arrived they made people board as fast as possible flight was on an atr which seemed well maintained and had comfortable leather seats catering water and chocolate bar fine for this short hop transferring in lpa is easy although passengers possibly could easily miss the sign for connecting flights
6973,china eastern airlines,1,uncomfortable and unpleasant,yangon to new zealand via kunming do not fly to nz on this airline you have to get deembark and reembark in china and sydney luggage and all china is a terrible place to fly through rude officious uncomfortable and unpleasant
14186,luxair,7,this flight went very smoothly,as always this flight went very smoothly the flight departed on time a very modern plane lxlbb the breakfast on board was although smaller than in previous years very tasty the crew were very professional but as always not a single english announcements i hope it is only for me but this really annoys me spanish announcements should be introduced as for lg flights to madrid or barcelona on board wifi would be more than welcome and miles should be earned on this route
12188,jetairfly,2,jetairfly customer review,brussels djerba this flight used quite a wellused and tired 737 the legroom was the smallest i experienced even my seat neighbor less than 175 cm tall was cramped with his knees by the next seat beverages and food only for cash seat reservation also only if you pay 3 euros they changed the flight plan also shortly before travel added one extra stop in mir and 90 extra minutes of flight time bugger for this kind of lowcost service the flight itself is not cheap enough better pay a few euros more and fly tunisair or air berlin also not great airlines but with better comfort and subjective safety feel to it
12044,jet airways,1,refused to let us check in,we were due to fly london to delhi on 15th november 2018 the tube line to heathrow was suspended due to a trespasser on the line so we arrived later than planned but we were still there an hour before our scheduled takeoff time jet airways refused to let us check in saying that the gate had closed even though we were with a tour operator who already had our flight tickets we were denied access and could not check in we spent 3200 on the tour for a nine nightfive destination tour and we have now lost all our money the insurance company will not pay because they say they will not pay for transport disruption we have taken this up with the tour operator who say that it is totally down to the airline has anyone had any problems like this with jet airways before

18044,silkair,7,fine for a short flight,singapore to luang prabang knowing ahead we had downloaded the silkair entertainment on our ipads as it would have been a boring 3 hr flight we boarded efficiently and the aircraft left on time not so slick as their parent company singapore air and the cabin felt old and basic however it was fine for a short flight the refresher towels were cold and in a pack we were given a meal it was not very nice but that wasnt important we returned from vientiane and again it was okay not special but we got there and returned with no stress
8831,ethiopian airlines,5,okay for what they charge,first time using ethiopian airlines check in at heathrow t2 was pretty quick although the checkin agent failed to include my frequent flier status on the boarding pass which presented issues when trying to use the fast track lounges luckily i had a copy on my mobile used the silverkris lounge which is good boarding a bit disorganised but once onboard my seat 11a was comfortable enough flight departed on time for the 7 hour flight to addis ababa service food dinner breakfast and crew where okay the ptv was also alright the seat not too bad arriving addis the transfer was straight forward and the airport itself wasnt too bad i used the cloud nine gold lounge which is a bit better than the general terminal boarding the 2nd flight was again a bit of a mess another a350 and once again seat 11a however the seat had a fault so not too comfortable crew where a bit vacant on this flight the food a sandwich and lunch was again okay perhaps better than the first flight arrived cpt more or less on time after a flight of around 6 hours bags delivered quickly so i suppose all in all ethiopian got me from a to b finally c without too much stress i guess the one improvement would be the ground operation its pretty poor and rude at some points i wouldnt use ethiopian again but they are okay for what they charge
21775,virgin america,3,bad attitude by gate agent,los angeles to seattle really poor service and bad attitude by gate agent unnecessarily gave me a hard time despite being first class unfriendly staff attendants that kept complaining about becoming part of alaska and how different the culture between the two airlines is lounge was cramped and hardly had any good food
12603,jetstar pacific,5,onboard staff courteous,website continuously timedout when making booking one occasion got right down to confirm flight then message appeared that the price has increased so had to start again not just confirm the increased price the increase was not much about 100000 vnd checkin process and staff member serving was excellent onboard staff courteous polite and speaks good english both at airport and on jetstar website lack of information about flight boardingtakeoff timings at han airport the departure info screens just gave us the details that were on our travel itinerary our flight was delayed 45 minutes airport flight departure screens or announcements did not tell us this we were queuing from 7pm for 725pm takeoff but boarding only commenced at 745pm for 815pm takeoff online departure times on jetstar website gave only the info provided on itinerary it was not updated to reflect delays onboard services generally good but lack choices for hot meals there are four options on the menu only one choice was available from the beginning the pork with rice
17426,sa express,5,carrier imposed fees,george to johannesburg we book tickets for our two grandchildren twice a year as they have to fly as unaccompanied minors i have to make the booking through the call center the fare indicated on the website for the specific flights was r1 18221 per person for the return flights between johannesburg and george before i gave all the traveler details i asked the operator what i would have to pay and was informed that it would be r236442 per child this excluded the r10000 per ticket to be charged because i booked through the call center when i called back to find out if the children had been accepted as unaccompanied minors for the flight and to make the payment the amount was suddenly r295722 per child that is 25 times more than when one would and could book on the internet on checking the eticket per childone finds the following info fare calculation r69750 x 2 r1 39500 rounded off to r1 40000 plus taxes totaling r46122 and carrier imposed fees r 109600 which brings the total to r2 95722 per child
4604,asiana airlines,9,very surprised by this airline,london to seoul via osaka with asiana airlines i was very surprised by this airline first leg of the journey we were going on the a350 we had plenty of leg room though the seats were a bit uncomfortable cabin crew were very friendly and they spoke perfect english food was very good i chose the korean option from london to seoul and when coming back to london i chose the western option very good both for airplane food if you dont like spicy dont choose the korean option entertainment was a bit limited not as many options as other carriers like emirates and i was disappointed they didnt have any korean dramas overall a good airline price was cheap compared with korean airlines or the japanese carriers
13960,loganair,1,service not now become operational,belfast to carlisle i booked a return flight with loganair in april for a journey in the middle of june which required an overnight stay in carlisle i recently received an email to say that this service will not now become operational until september and the flights have been cancelled this was because changing circumstances around the airports staffing means that this cannot be completed in time to receive scheduled flights as planned on 4 june i booked a room which not thinking anything would be amiss was nonrefundable apparently booking a hotel room is treated as being inconsequential even where there is an overnight stay perhaps i should sleep rough and cannot be refunded
2239,air mauritius,6,i would recommend this airline,overall quite pleasant experience in business class seat 2a two hours late leaving heathrow due to a technical issue caused by the pushback truck no fault of air mauritius during that time the air steward and stewardess came around with more champagne and small a packet of snacks and kept us updated once airborne the service started promptly with delicious meals and attentive service from the air steward the catering out of heathrow is delicious and a lot better than coming from mauritius the catering from mauritius needs improving seat is quite spacious however i found it quite hard when sleeping british airways business class seats are more comfortable and have better padding i only managed to get a few hours sleep perhaps air mauritius should provide a mattresstopper like to put on top of the seat to provide more padding as they do in other airlines as part of their turndown service the air steward was very polite and addressed me by name no wifi was available on that particular aircraft the air steward said that it was the only airbus a350 of the fleet which didnt have wifi i would recommend this airline the cabin product could be better but the cabin staff makes up for it
5153,ba cityflyer,5,average short haul experience,zurich to london city average short haul flight experience easy and smooth morning flight to london cabin was narrow but ok although not very clean the business class was half empty and the cabin crew was sometimes friendly but most of the time enjoying themselves while chatting to each other ba served hot food on this short flight it looked not good and it was not good otherwise nothing special
14303,lynx air,3,not an enjoyable experience,figured id try lynx air as the price is very affordable that is their only redeeming quality my flight was delayed in total by 11 hours the real problem was that the flight was delayed 4 times throughout the day meaning most of the passengers arrived early and were waiting around anxiously for hours it was not an enjoyable experience at all the staff had very little sympathy which okay i get it since this airline is now notorious for delays when finally on board the staff were very inexperienced and lacked the grace of attendants on the larger airlines overall 310 those 3 points only come from the affordability i wont be getting on another lynx flight ever id rather pay a bit more and have the security of a more reputable airline
18473,skywest airlines,8,big thank you to staff,a big thank you to staff of skywest airlines at st george airport and on flight dl7393 wednesday may 18 2016 my age related reduced mobility and endurance makes travel more difficult than in past years and i had dreaded this flight however skywest staff made it one of the easiest flights i have had in years of travel the male attendant in the boarding lounge saw my cane and luggage and without my asking came to me and asked if i would like help which i accepted gratefully on boarding the female flight attendant also immediately took my luggage and placed it for me on deplaning a male staff member offered to handle my luggage and proceeded to get me through the arrival lounge and to a wheel chair where i was taken all the way to the outside taxi stand given that the skywest lounge at slc airport is far removed from the baggage claim and taxi stand this was more than just a convenience i was able to arrive home without being exhausted kudos to the above mentioned skywest staff a team of champions

16738,regional express,5,regional express customer review,sydneyballinasydney was really impressed with both flights the small cabin was not an issue on 80min flights seats comfortable and adequate room only recommendation is to not take too much carryon baggage as there is limited storage space both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy great addition to both flights were the fas who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either teacoffeewater on the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems the weather in byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon virgin flight id recommend rex over virgin and jetstar i payed less than half for the rex airfare than what the other two were offering and was twice as happy flying with them

7622,corsair,8,corsair customer review,paris orly to montreal return the business class fare classe grand large is less than 13 of that of a regular carrier ok the seats only recline to 130 degrees but the 222 configuration of their brand new a330 is definitely better than the 232 which air france provide in their b777 excellent food and drinks wide choice of entertainment courteous friendly and efficient service who could ask for more the only slight disappointment was the badly designed footrest which does not make much of a difference all in all a very pleasant experience
5208,ba cityflyer,5,ba cityflyer customer review,barcelonalondon city check in smooth slightly overweight luggage accepted with no extra charges boarding was good and departure punctual aircraft an e90 felt roomy although the placement of armrests was anything but comfortable and my arms kept falling asleep crew was jolly and seemed to enjoy their work inflight service was the bare minimum consisted of a single beverage run only and choice of biscuits or granola bars arrival was an absolute nightmare london city airport closed the runway during our approach apparently due to a bird strike ended up in a dizzying holding pattern for more than 30mins which made some passengers ill pilot finally decided to divert to london stansted the absolute furthest airport from the city was told buses would take us into london after more than 1hr of sitting on the ground with no offer of water or any other service from crew and at first being told that buses were being organized and we would be on our way shortly pilot finally told us we would be taking off and heading for london city as they had reopened the runway finally arrived at our destination 2 hrs behind schedule having only had a small cup of tea in the more than 4 hrs since we left barcelona the runway closure was of course not bas fault but all in all not a very pleasant experience
3073,air transat,1,a pleasant experience,ft lauderdale to toronto what a pleasant experience from the fort lauderdale counter to the plane at the fort lauderdale the staff was so humble and funny while he was checking all our paperwork he took our stress away on the plane the staff were super amazing to handle my kids inquiries they answered them very professionally we received sanitizers pack and complementary drinks i needed that so much so as my kids very polite plane entertainment system i wasnt aware air transat has entertainment for free you can bring your own headphones and voila you have hours of entertainments last ten years i have been traveling to florida twice a year to my parents its just a three hour flight so never experienced this type of awesome service my kids didnt have any headphones the flight attendant provided headphones for free it was getting better and better thank you air transat for your awesome service i will be traveling soon in march to punta cana hopefully i will be able to travel with you guys again
15133,nok air,4,the crew didnt look happy,my first time with nok air from bangkok to phuket the flight took off and landed on time legroom was fine my seat was dirty and not cleaned from the previous flight the food they hand out isnt special but i didnt expect anything for a one hour flight so i cant complain the crew didnt look happy and were unfriendly something i havent experienced before on a thai airline i couldnt understand what they said during the announcements it seemed like even they werent very eager to be on that flight it was my first and probably last experience on this airline
20721,tigerair australia,6,the seats are okay,melbourne to sydney found that the journey was not as bad as people said it would be checkin was smooth even though we didnt do it online the ground staff were okay i found that both flights including the return were not delayed or held back a long time the maximum time we were on the ground was approx 1520mins after boarding the seats are okay theyre fine for shortdistance trips but it can get squashy as the seats are very close together horizontally and vertically the attendants seemed as if they didnt want to be there they were nice enough to handle but werent all smiles i didnt purchase any food
7625,corsair,5,corsair customer review,purchased 2 tickets in grand large class from st martin to paris round trip nowhere in the options displayed are you told that you leave from grand case airport in st martin you are not told that you change not only planes but airlines as well in point a pitre guadeloupe passengers should know these facts before they purchase their tickets we rushed to grand case to find out that the flight we were on had been cancelled this left us with 4 hours to kill in sxm and a 30 minute connection in ptp luckily our luggage made it we will not travel on corsair again if we can avoid it the service on board was not the best the seats left a lot to desire their video equipment and headsets are old fashioned the food was not that great either
1812,air india,8,overall good customer service,overall good customer service quick checkin 3 meals on syd del sector and one meal del bom sector staff were attentive and courteous decent leg space normally 787 has a high level of humidity and moisture but these aircraft were very dry dont know did they change the settings as a result you feel quite dry on these flights i was lucky my entertainment unit worked but the volume is always high the aircraft was clean but their bathroom stinks except for the bathroom and entertainment all went well
4978,avianca,2,as uncomfortable as possible,after checking in at the gate on the return from guatemala avianca employees there took from us carryon water and other beverages that we had just purchased before allowing us onto the plane then the flight attendants waited an hour or so later an hour or so later to pass out beverages for purchase seems the airline is inventing security concerns just so it can squeeze an extra buck from customers while making those of us taking the flight feel as uncomfortable as possible the flight delay of an hour meant connecting flights were nearly missed message from captain made it sound like they thought they were on time
5708,blue islands,5,we left about seven hours late,i hate to say this but my opinion of blue islands has really changed after my flight to southampton it started by the airport announcing that my 7am flight was delayed to 940am due to a late inbound aircraft once 940 came around we were informed that the flight was delayed until 1050am due to bad weather there was light mist but lots of other aircraft were arriving in fine soon after that we were informed that blue islands had no idea when our plane was going to arrive and told to wait until 1030 for new information the new information was infact just that the new information would be coming at 1130am and then next info at 1230 and then next info at 1300 absolutely no blue islands or flybe staff around in the terminal then our plane lands but the delay still keeps on being pushed back in total we left about seven hours late on the way back we were delayed about half an hour which isnt too bad the aircraft we were on were clearly very old and tired there were some loose pieces of metal on the cabin walls and the seats had small damage and overall the cabin was fairly discoloured and dirty cabin crew were very friendly however i usually am fine with blue islands and have no problems with the flybe franchise however the service was awful i would try and avoid blue islands in the future
6807,central mountain air,8,central mountain air customer review,yqq to yvr comox to vancouver for such a small airline and airplane we were pleasantly surprised it was no more expensive for our family of four to take the cma flight than it would be to take the ferry to vancouver and back and for a couple of nights in hotels to make our connecting flights south being a smaller plane it was open seating we were in the emergency seats going both ways and both times the pilots made sure to make eye contact with us when explaining the procedures and asked if we had questions cma is very good about the schedule both flights left on time and arrived on time its a nice short flight being a smaller plane it was a bit bumpy both ways but as someone who has become airsick on bigger jets i had no problem at all the only negative comment i have is that being a prop plane it was very loud and the announcements they made arrival time etc were impossible to hear the recording needs to be louder
9927,flysafair,4,disappointed by the professionalism by the flight attendants,my family and i are absolutely disappointed by the professionalism by the flight attendants we had an issue with another passenger with placing our luggage in the overhead bin and none of the attendants came to assist instead they saw it fit to just stare at us when it was our turn to disembark from the plane the flight attendant skipped our seat and proceeded to allow other passengers to leave the plane i did not appreciate the flight attendants tone when we ordered snacks she was not friendly the service was just appalling and disappointing
22193,vivaaerobs,1,i asked for a refund and they said no refunds,we booked flights to mexico city for july 4th weekend and today i get an email saying our flight is cancelled i called into viva aerobus customer support and they said that there was no reason listed as to why the flight was cancelled but that they can book me a flight out of a different city san antonio which is about 100 miles away i asked for a refund and they said no refunds they offered a voucher to be used within 80 days but i refused this offer why would i want to book with this carrier again if they cancel flights with no notice and dont offer refunds the agent wouldnt allow me to speak to a supervisor and was very rude and not helpful i went ahead and disputed the cost of the tickets through my credit card company i hope if this happens to other travelers that they each let their credit card company know so that eventually visa or mastercard stop providing payment services to them worst airline ever
21022,tuifly,3,just bad practices,heraklion to brussels how to make extra money on clients i booked my ticket late in the evening close to midnight i received 10 minutes later a cancellation of reservation due to late payment arrival then it was after midnight and i processed again my request no email to acknowledge receipt whatsoever in the morning convinced the payment did not go through i rebooked my ticket then i received the two confirmations in one go i called them they accepted to reimburse me the ticket but minus 12 euros of double reservation no chance to explain this was their it system not working just a wall of denial for information the ticket was 200 euros and thus this was not a low price ticket i am very annoyed they never admitted their website is dysfunctional and make clients pay for it on top of course of the very expensive call you have to pay when complaining just bad practices and it is sad this is permitted
8760,emirates,7,good value and great staff,bangkok to frankfurt via dubai the service on board was great the touchscreen of the board entertainment system is on some planes are better than on others the movie collection was vast but didnt fit my taste my seat wasnt locked so it changed position without pushing the button however those minors didnt bother me because of the good value and the great staff what bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the emirates on ground service emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the covid19 pandemic for three years what was great however our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her however we saved about 150 euro for her previous ticket we had to add another 600 euro for the new ticket to get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants on the way back we had to pay additional 217 euro for overweight that was new for us because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase maybe it is standard nowadays but every weight scale is different therefore i think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern they count the overweight as total if family members check in individually they could save a few bucks
5985,breeze airways,2,disorganized terrible customer service,disorganized terrible customer service when something goes wrong i booked two one way flights with this airline since the routes were direct i upgraded to first class the first flight on the way there was a good experience with the exception of an initial delay that was less than 1 hour the seat in first class was comfortable and service on the flight was good things fell apart on the return flight the flight was delayed three times the gate was switched to the other end of the airport on the last delay issues occurred at the airport where the flight was removed from the status board for some reason however the breeze app listed the new gate but upon arrival to the gate there were no agents in uniform and the gate was advertised for a completely different airline after 15 min of searching for either a breeze representative there were none or someone working for the airport the flight was missed once i finally found a breeze representative they offered no realistic solutions the breeze agent claimed to have no responsibility for the monitor at the gate advertising a completely different flight with a different airline i was offered to be booked on a flight several days later to a different destination city that was more than a 6 hour drive from my original booking destination i was forced to book a new one way ticket from the airport costing close to 50000 just to get home breeze has made no offerings and seems to accept zero responsibility i highly encourage you to not book with this airline because if something happens good luck getting to your destination or back home i have always been a huge delta fan and would highly suggest sticking with a larger commercial airline where they value customer service and will take care to get you to your destination
2556,air new zealand,2,i felt i was sacrificed,i checked in and secured my boarding pass on boarding i was informed your seat has been changed for a better leg room only to discover that i was moved to sit with one of the dreaded gang members in their full regalia racial profiling at its best i felt i was sacrificed
22026,vistara,9,flight was excellent,london to mumbai flight was excellent dreamliner flight the staff the cabin crew were good but i feel the flight from mumbai to chennai was not up to the mark not faced any issue but i feel its not as standardised as the international london to mumbai flight the food was amazing and overall i love vistara more than ba

16471,qantaslink,8,excellent service on this sector,melbourne to devonport and return smooth flights in both directions online checkin worked well as did the automated bag drop in melbourne both flights were punctual indeed the return flight operated a few minutes early seats are a little narrow but otherwise fine for this short flight on the outward late afternoon journey we got a large and varied snack pack along with a full drinks service so i snacked instead of snoozed my way to tasmania on the return early afternoon flight the offering was a nice friande with tea or coffee all in all qantaslink offer excellent service on this sector
17360,s7 siberia airlines,8,professional and attentive,novosibirsk to hong kong this was my return sector of my trip to russia aircraft was a new b737max8 flight attendant dedicated to the business cabin only 8 seats in the business cabin great for making new friends no lie flat bed seats very comfortable and plenty of leg room flight attendant was professional and attentive food was very good
8079,dragonair,4,wont fly dragonair again,hanoi to hong kong with dragonair the flight eventually departed 3 hours late meaning we missed our connection to sydney arrival time was around 0110 and the transfer desk in hong kong was a complete shambles and we finally got our hotel voucher more than an hour later for a hotel 30 minutes away the queue for immigration was horrendous and we could see we would be very unlikely to get to the hotel before 3am since our rearranged flight was due to leave at 0910 we decided to stay in the plaza premium lounge airside all this could have been avoided if dragonair had been proactive in arranging accommodation in advance of our late arrival in hong kong they had enough time the aircraft flight and meal were reasonable though cabin service commenced very late in the flight i read that dragonair has one of the worst reputations for time keeping this may not be entirely its fault however lack of organisation was very apparent making this one of my worst flying experience in over 50 years wont fly dragonair again
13004,korean air,9,attentive but not so friendly,tokyo to seoul check in is quick seats are pretty good the only thing is that headphones and blankets are not available in the seats so you need to ask for some the cabin crew are attentive but not so friendly onboard meals are excellent but few movie options
10764,gulf air,7,price was ridiculously cheap,london to bangkok via bahrain price was ridiculously cheap booked a week prior to departure free seat selection 24 hours prior to departure aircraft nearly new boeing 787900 with decent seat pitch and immaculately clean poor seat width as with all 9 abreast carriersso vacant adjacent seat welcome ife reasonable choice but could be expanded nice too that no ife boxes under seat limiting leg room as with some carriers service nice to have an amenity kit on night flights but dental kit inside would be good food nothing to rave about but appropriate for times and flight length cabin staff were not overly warm or welcoming but did what they had to do bahrain airport shambles and useless would choose again for the right price
13884,lion air,3,left almost an hour late,bought a through ticket from yahukimo via jayapura to jakarta with only 30 minutes time to change the flight from yahukimo left almost an hour late and despite rushing they closed the boarding gate for the jakarta flight before i could get on that was not surprising however lion air staff at jayapura tried to blame missing the connection on me despite their first flight being an hour late and insist that i buy a new ticket to jakarta it took almost an hour of arguing to get them to rebook me for next mornings flight at no cost other than this issue both flights were uneventful
11159,iberia,1,assistance is really poor,they lost my luggage 5 days ago the assistance is really poor every time i reach out i get different information they cant even tell me if they know if it lost or not they provide no solution
14711,meridiana,8,meridiana customer review,travelled from turin catania return with an infant under 2yrs old check in smooth and flight left on time and even landed early both ways crew were friendly and even gave drinks on board at no extra cost which is not bad for a lowcost airline flight from catania to turin was on new a319 and had no problems we have taken meridiana a few times now and have never had any problems and would recommend
20037,thai airways,4,pretty disappointed with the service,we travelled thai airways from melbourne to chennai via bangkok and vice versa we are still not sure on the process to book the bassinet seat and on based on what priority it can be booked we are travelling with a 9 month old and we will have to sit with infant through out the flight i know few airlines which provide bassinet for babies until 1 year old we checked with customer care on the process to book the front row seat with leg space during our flight to bangkok and they advised us to speak at the counter at the counter they say the flight is full and asked us call and book before the flight we somehow managed travelling to bangkok which is a 9 hour flight with baby in our lap we had some trouble when people in front of us push their seat back on our return flight we checked with them please note we consistently called them no response mailed them no response we rang them again and the officer said she cannot book online and we call them some hours before we did call and still we didnt get the seat the lady in the counter said we should call and talk end of story we didnt get seat and no staff is able to direct us on the process to book this seat in thai airways only infants below 6 months can avail the facility of bassinet i am not sure i saw babies or parents with babies in that seat in some place they say if we pay we can get the seat we are pretty disappointed with the service and expect parents with babies or toddlers under 2 years get some preferences with regards to seat
18570,smartwings,8,valueformoney ratio is good,choose this flight to get to tirana for a business trip because it corresponded perfectly with my scheduled meetings and after reading some reviews i was really curious online checkin without problems flight operated under an okflight number but without option to change the allocated seat swift boarding through passenger boarding bridge flight departed and arrived on time cabin was clean and tidy staff friendly and professional seat was ok legroom as well compared to other lcc airlines and given the flight time of less than two hours i am 187 m tall water was served complimentary the choice of drinks and snacks available for purchase is ok overall nothing to complain about the valueformoney ratio is good and if you dont need to work during the flight or expect to get spoiled it seems to be a good choice

7336,comair,8,comair customer review,another trip from johannesburg to harare 737s both ways and all on time crew were good kept us informed particularly on return flight when there were very strong winds and mine dump dust at joburg outward meal was a hot meal return meal was the whole grain rollthis seems to be standard no complaints at all and plenty of leg room in these old planes
17759,scoot,6,cabin crew were friendly and helpful,positives flights were on time and cabin crew were friendly and helpful actual seats standard leg room for any long distance flights so not bad negative no inflight entertainment no tv screens so download films onto your mobile device and watch during flight but you have to pay for power 600 each way negative stodgy microwave food that you have to pay for top tip eat in the departure lounge and take drinks and sandwiches with you for the flight negative have to pay for all drinks and they only take credit cards no cash and no debit cards negative no pillows or blankets so take your own in the end you can pay about 80 more for these extras that you wouldnt pay on a full service airline once you get your head around the fact that this is a long distance ryanair and you come prepared for the above its actually a reasonable direct londonbangkok flight
6448,caribbean airlines,2,worst airline i have experienced,my caribbean airlines flight to kingston was on november 26th at 1am i got to jfk airport around 10pm on the screen it said my flight was cancelled i asked one of the staff what was going on all she said was i had to stand in line and speak with the staff in the counter standing in line took about 2 hours i was already pissed off because they could have informed me beforehand via email or phone that my flight was cancelled instead of me having to rush to the airport and stand in line in the middle of the night as i understand from other people standing in line they were trying to book the passengers to different flights that evening as chance passengers when it was finally my turn the only flight available that they offered me was at 9am or 1am the following day nov 27th it was 12 midnight already they didnt offer complimentary room to stay for the night if i chose the 9am flight ill have to sleep in the airport for 9hours until my flight the staff was very rude he acted like i was stupid for asking questions not a single apology from any of them for the fact that i was inconvenienced the staff was acting like i was the one inconveniencing him no reason was given on why the flight was cancelled the next evening i was at the airport again at 10pm for my 1am flight nov 27th it was good news for me when i saw that the flight will be leaving on time when it was my turn in the lady at the front charged me an extra 25 for my 2nd luggage i complained because i know i was allowed 2 luggages to check in at 50lbs each she reviewed their policy and said okay i didnt have to pay anymore this same lady took a long time checking me in because she was busy gossiping with fellow staff members its such a disappointment seeing unprofessional and rude employees long story short worst airline i have ever experienced

14655,meridiana,8,service onboard was good,new york jfk to naples with meridiana i was very apprehensive about flying meridiana after reading some reviews but im glad to say everything from the use of the air france lounge at jfk to the courtesy and service onboard was as good as any airline i have ever flown and it was equally true on our return flight from naples to jfk the only area that found on my 2 flights that need help is in the condition of the cabin and seats the business class seats are well worn and ready for replacement as well as the carpets etc our flights were generally on time and the ground people were organized and efficient the gods of aviation smiled on us
10622,goair,5,two hour delay with no explanation,delhi to mumbai our departure carried a two hour delay with no explanation and no information provided the flight however was good but the cabin crew seemed friendly but didnt say very much our two hour delay equalled a late arrival which was a shame but there was no apology and still no explanation as to the lateness of the departure

15589,onur air,7,onur air customer review,manchester to ercan via dalaman paid for extra legroom at man and these seats were good as they did have a lot of extra space flight left on time and checkin was good however there was a problem with the cabin crew in that they did not speak very good english and their announcements were very difficult to understand given that most of the people on board were english their lack of their ability to speak our language was very bad meal we were supplied with was alright and we were given plenty of drinks stopover in dalaman was a bit tedious and no one came near us when the crew changed over not offered any refreshments on the flight over return flight was ok but the reception at ercan airport was disgusting we were waiting in a queue at 330 in the morning and the ground staff were just laughing at us all standing waiting to be processed on the whole the flights were ok and the service on board but their lack of speaking english was i feel disrespectful however the flights were on time but long particularly having to wait for approx 45 minutes in dalaman before travelling onwards to ercan
7619,corsair,8,kind and helpful staff,very comfortable flight the flight departed in the evening and a full meal bread cheese 2 warm dish options desert water with complimentary wine of good quality was provided arrived early morning in paris before arrival breakfast was served also additional beverages were distributed twice during the flight after the meals kind and helpful staff reasonable legroom and the option to select a seat for a small fee inflight entertainment was ok but very french oriented just like the messages from captain and crew delivered in accented and rapid english the airport at point a pitre only uses french for the announcements luggage delivery at orly took quite a long time but unclear whether the airline is to blame overall a very comfortable economy class experience if you dont understand french though you might struggle a bit to understand the announcements etc

19995,thai airasia,7,this airline is a good choice,khon kaen to bangkok don muang thai airasia provides good quality for the money though there are minor points of criticism i bought their premium flex package which gave me the option to choose my seat 1c a meal even though the flight took only 55 minutes plus water 20 kg luggage and express luggage and boarding the flight attendants were polite but a bit too reserved to my taste the seat was a bit too narrow and the meal lasagna too bland boarding was fast with a separate check in for those with a premium package thus hardly any waiting time my luggage came almost as first so they were true to their promise for short flights as mine i think this airline is a good choice
13919,lion air,7,avoid this seat on longer flights,denpasar to yogyakarta overall quite satisfied but seat comfort is the main issue i cant deny that i went for the cheapest tickets online booking was easy online checkin opens 24 hours before the flight and i was able to already select seats for free which was nice checkin and baggage dropoff at denpasar bali airport was quick we booked 15kg of baggage one bag was slightly overweight and i didnt bother too much beforehand the employee weighed the two bags together and it said 292kg so no problem at all i printed online boarding passes but we got new ones at baggage dropoff flight boarded nicely on time about 10 oclock before the 1025 departure time pushback was at about 1030 and takeoff just shortly thereafter according to schedule flighttime would be only 55 minutes and landing would be at 1020 java time is one hour before bali but we landed at about 1040 taxi took only a minute and 1050 we were waiting inside on our luggage that took about 15 minutes to appear on the belt maybe a little long the flight itself was boring there is no service available flight attendants seemed professional though the seat was the main letdown a little filthy and legroom insufficient should have been the same 29 inch pitch as on airasia but felt tighter couldnt keep my legs straight with my 192m and had to bend them because of the short flight it was doable but i would try to avoid this seat on longer flights i would fly lion air again on short flights our flight operated nicely on time but i hear that can also be an issue
11191,iberia,3,the airline has lost our bags,the airline has lost our bags on the start of a 4 week trip we were given phone numbers for havana where no one picks up twitter response was sarcastic and implied we double check we flew with iberia we tried whatsapp and that apparently doesnt deal with baggage issues the website says our bags cant be found and we tried the uk number with no information available and to be told that our contact details were not even attached to our ticket profile or claim despite being an iberia member and long time one world member so details are on everything understand that issues happen so not annoyed about that but the appalling customer service and total lack of information is infuriating
3861,alaska airlines,4,seat upgrades are service charges,i had a credit in my alaska wallet from a flight i had to cancel due to covid the credit included a payment i made for premium economy seats when i went to apply the credit to a later flight i was shocked to see my cc was charged for the upgrade to premium nowhere on alaskas website does it say that credits cant be used for seat upgrades inquiring with customer service i was told that seat upgrades are service charges and are therefore excluded on our recent flight from austinbergstrom to seattle i upgraded to premium economy paying with a cc not a credit but was informed the day before that the livery had changed from a 737900 to a 737700 and there were no premium seats we are not short people and had to spend the 4 12 flight in very cramped seats on a flight that was booked to capacity delta will be our goto airline from now on
13962,loganair,1,delayed by 2 hours,islay to glasgow appalling customer service we were delayed by 2 hours so we missed our connecting flight loganair took no responsibility and weve had to wait 11 hours overnight at the airport for the next available flight and pay for a new onward flight even though loganair is meant to be in partnership with ba from talking to locals at the airport it seems this is a regular occurrence also having said theyd make sure our bags came off first they were actually the last 2 bags off what a hopeless service i wont be using them again and would suggest getting the ferry instead
11158,iberia,3,my suitcase did not arrive,i flew from madrid to alicante on 19th february my suitcase did not arrive after 5 days they have not been able to get my suitcase i have spent hours on the phone i have lost tons of money buying clothes for work wasted countless hours and 5 days later same situation tomorrow i go back to dubai and i have no idea if this airline will ever deliver my suitcase
10888,hawaiian airlines,4,thanks for making a stressful travel day,so my ticket was zone 3 priority my question was will they call a priority line to board or is it just zone 3 this agent yelled at me telling me my ticket says zone 3 over there i can read and write i follow up with it also says priority boarding so im just asking to make sure i board with the right group or doesnt really mean anything zone 3 over there in an unnecessary loud yelling pitch once more there is no reason to yell at any passenger she has the wrong temperament for her job i was embarrassed and boarded my flight very upset in hawaii of all places then there were issues with plane and we were boarded and deboarded 2x so we had to stand in line just my luck we get her again patiently waiting finally our turn we wait to be summoned to approach her desk after watching her handle all people before us just fine she looks up and say do yall have a question or what after standing in line all that time yes we have questions and and need a connection flight issues she told us she doesnt know anything we dont have any option and just to sit tight sorry for another 6 hours this has been the rudest experience ive encountered and added unnecessary stress to a stressful travel day on their part now if i would have conducted my self with the same volume and shortness reminding her that im not a child dont yell at me im standing right here they would not allow me to board their plane so i have to take the mistreatment and deal with it after spending my money with this airlines and im sitting here looking at her in her computer helping every guest after me she didnt even look at anything in the computer to me i love coming to maui we come every year and this is my first time flying with hawaiian airlines honolulu was my transfer flight never again thanks for making a stressful travel day with hawaiian airlines more uncomfortable and have me sitting here angry instead of relaxing to get through this next 6 hours in the airport they announced they were helping with connecting flights over the speaker yet at her desk she advises calling the airline my ticket is with so why did i stand in line 45 mins at 1 am
13787,liat,9,liat customer review,looks like most of liat reviews are only done when there is a problem we flew barbados to st vincent return and both flights were good out was on time and bags ok with full plane back was early landed immigration and bags 15 minutes before scheduled landing time
10899,hawaiian airlines,1,will not book again,hawaiian airlines changed my flight and lengthened my layover by 2 hours when i called to change the flight to closer to what i originally booked and paid for i was told it was too late and i was misunderstanding i have never had an airline customer service experience like this one where i was blamed for a schedule change on their end do not recommend this airline and will not book again
15340,olympic air,2,too big for carryon luggage,we arrived to the ticket counter at 5am to get our boarding passes there were 7 of us the person attending looked at our luggage and said only one of our luggage was too big for carryon so we paid 25 eoros to check it in when we arrived to the gate and were about to board they attendant said that 4 other of our luggage were too big for carryon luggage same luggage we had on carryon on 4 other flights we took to get to santorini because we did not pay at the counter it would be 40 euros per luggage i told the attendant that the person in the ticket counter told us they were ok for carryon and that person was actually also now helping with boarding so i pointed to her one was the person in the ticket counter and the other identified herself as the supervisor we talked to her telling her that 40 euros was extreme when we could have paid 25 euros at the ticket counter it was like talking to the wall she didnt look at us and really didnt care what we were saying they did that to 4 other people that were also tourists its seemed like they were deliberately misleading people to charge more money it was very upsetting because the flight had so much space available for our luggage they should train their staff with better customer service
10304,georgian airways,5,crew were very pleasant,check in was late opening and the agent was very unfriendly however there was no queue tbilisi airport is very easy and quick to navigate through and georgian airways use a thirdparty lounge prime class which you see as soon as you get through passport control the lounge is fantastic boarding was very quick but no priority boarding was offered the aircraft was changed from an e190 to a crj200 which was quite old and rather uncomfortable the business class seats were european short haul style ie normal seats with very little legroom and even less width for a 30 minute flight it was fine but i wouldnt have wanted to spend any longer on it the service consisted of a pre departure bottle of water and a drink during the flight i obviously dont expect a meal on such a short flight but some kind of snack would have been appreciated but they didnt have anything the crew were very pleasant and spoke good english no communication from the pilots however we left and arrived early for a short hop id have no problem flying georgian again though i would think twice before booking a longer trip
19042,srilankan airlines,9,very pleasant flight,very pleasant flight friendly staff good food drinks every 30min good movies on the airplane system i recommend
8704,emirates,9,checkin was easy,mauritius to dubai checkin was easy and also enjoyed priority immigration and security emirates uses the air mauritius lounge and the lounge offered better than expected services inflight the flight attendants seemed to treat passengers with genuine hospitality for the first time felt that the bar at the back of business class cabin was a good place to relax the food was great and good wine selections the business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people including myself and the inflight internet offering is far from satisfactory inflight internet could be purchased at 1699 for a 6hour flight excluding takeoff and landing the internet would only be provided for 4 hours at most and streaming would still be blocked
7823,csa czech airlines,4,expensive with poor conditions,flew bucharest to prague expensive with poor conditions i traveled better with ryanair and it was also cheaper like a quarter of the price here with luggage included and so on tarom was also at a better price and with better conditions czech airlines do not offer you the minimum seat space not a good food service and also the baggage requirements are very annoying

17201,rwandair,4,disaster for night flights,flew on a narrowbody b737800 at midnight on 2 march 2019 from kigali to dubai direct flight in contrast to fly opposite direction this aircraft has no lie flat seats which is a disaster for night flights i purchased the ticket in faith of their refurbished a330 but they made an equipment change obviously due to low load checkin online is a joke and waste of time after filling some 7 pages with info online they eventually laconically inform that checkin must be done in airport worst landed in t2 in dubai which is a messy lcc terminal and fought my way to t1 for onward flights homepage misleading and systematically hide info on booking class even their most expensive bisticket give only few miles which furthermore only can be used on rwandair lounge in kigali is fine but they have blindfolded all windows with tape to deprive passengers any view of tarmac which is painful embarasing and a misunderstood security issue luggage checked in to next destination only thus had to fight again in dubai for further luggage transfers these 6 issues deprives rating 6 points of 10 leaving us with a poor score of 4 on the brighter side is the nice atmosphere onboard great traditional rwandan decorated interior in business cabin fas were great and well caring champagne and welcome drinks provided menu cards and drink lists provided sparse supply eg only one kind of beer and only two dishes offered for supper only 2 options the food was only passable but plenty breakfast of poor quality punctual airline with stunning tall statured fas however their flight equipment is limited and they are not attached to any airline alliance thus miles earning is only for their dream miles program which is very stingy with miles even for full fare business tickets will chose kenya airways and ethiopian in future despite detours over nbo or add as they are considerably cheaper and mostly have a better product
10658,golden myanmar airlines,9,very friendly flight attendant,short domestic flight from heho to nyaungu bagan for about 62 usd per person with luggage included checkin was done in a very small departure hall which was more like a bus terminal rather than an airport terminal with wooden kiosks received boarding cards without seat and name attached to it as it was choose your seat in this flight after security and getting our boarding card stamped by passport control we were now waiting for our flight which turned out to be delayed by about an hour without any announcement the moment we were ready for boarding a wooden stick with our flight was shown and upon exiting the terminal we crossed passengers from another arriving flight to board our aircraft greeted by a very friendly flight attendant who handed us some refreshing towels not later than twenty minutes from boarding call we were already rolling for take off service started quickly with a small snack box which included some water and a snack landing was good in night and luggage was collected via open door in which luggage was dropped as no luggage belt was present

5420,bassaka air,7,courteous cabin crew,flew phnom penh to siem reap with bassaka air as i knew nothing about this airline i was a bit apprehensive but there was no need to be checkin was fast and friendly boarding was by bus and once on board the courteous cabin crew made us feel very welcome the plane was definitely old but very clean and our exit row seats had plenty of legroom other seats looked a bit cramped but the flight was short surprisingly a quick drink was served during the 40minute flight which operated 10 minutes early overall a pleasant experience the only negative was that the fasten seat belt signs in the cabin were not working
1956,air india express,4,air india express customer review,i paid inr 13000 on ix flight from kolkata to singapore compared to about 21000 in sq the aircraft was clean crew reasonably friendly they served snacks on the flight i would say if they keep the aircraft clean and maintains time its good value for money i would have to fly few more times to see if they are reliable

1968,air italy,3,i literally was trapped,new york jfk to rome via milan first ticketing counter very inconvenient counter locations at the airport the farthest counter from everything around the corner and hidden behind all other counters that you actually have to ask someone to locate by the way they do not affiliate with air italy first i thought it was just at jfk but to my surprise it was the same setup in rome seems like they picked the cheapest counters at the airport second leg room lets start with tight seats with no leg room they do not meet the standard requirements once the seat in front of me is reclined i literally was trapped and could not get up i could not even close the food tray that was jammed on my lap wanted to reach out to flight attendant for help but obviously couldnt reach out the overhead help button no one walked by for hours until dinner time but even then she was not able to help as if people in economy do not matter at all i understand that they have to treat upper class customers better but they cannot ignore economy class to that level third baggage fee no charge for luggage from us to rome but they hit you with no luggage allowed policy for economy unless you pay 100 euro each as if its not the same bag came on the flight in to rome why charge only one leg of the flight when i refused the pay they referred me to the supervisor who finally showed up after half an hour but was not helpful at all in fact she was extremely rude and pretty much said to us this the way it is whether you like or not
1377,air china,6,plane brought back memories,vancouver to guangzhou via beijing on my boeing 744 trip the plane brought back memories normally i like a updated and brightly lit cabin but the boeing 744 really brought something special their food is questionable and their inflight was entertainment system can have more selections they also have good value of money as my round trip costed just over 500cad overall they have great crew and value but can improve on the food and ife
7521,copa airlines,2,go with a company with better reviews,i tried for 24 hours to check in but their website would not recognize my booking code i contacted my agency they confirmed the code was correct and said i would have to check in at the airport my flight was at 555 am leaving mexico city which is a confusing airport to begin with and i was only able to arrive at the proper terminal just after 5 which is not copaa fault however the people at the desk would not let me check in saying the gate was closed an hr before the flight left however i cant help but think i could have still made it i asked what i should then do and they gave me a number with the quietest assistant ive ever heard on the other end who was unable to offer anything close to help i went back to the desk to find it empty every other airline desk was staffed except for copa for a full hour and a half while myself and other people waited for help i eventually had to buy 2 new tickets as i was going to miss my connector as well and after buying them i attempted to check in for them right away after waiting inline for another 45 min after the staff finally came back i was turned away as they said they would not check in other flights until after they had finished booking the current on and to come back in an hr and a half i did and they had issues printing my boarding pass then a supervisor was required who was half an hour late finally after another 20 min i had a boarding pass with no seat registered i inquired and they said they had overbooked the flight and that there was no guarantee of a seat which would again mean i would miss my connector and have to buy a 5th ticket from them eventually i did get a seat on that flight however i will go out of my way to not fly with copa again their web site not recognizing a valid reservation code the non existent phone help the 1 12 hour pause with no staff at the desk the complete lack of any attempt to make any of the situation easier the complete lack of any sense of urgency and the possibility of missing a connector because of their ineptitude was astonishing if youre planning a relatively complicated trip i would go with a company with better reviews
11023,hong kong airlines,3,flight is about 80 full,beijing to hong kong the flight is about 80 full my seat is in the middle next to wings i was served a meal without any choice as i really didnt want to eat spicy noodles the cabin attendant gave me breads instead but no butter since no entertainment on this old airplane a passenger use speaker loudly of his mobile phone to watch something in flight
7855,cubana airlines,1,worst airline i have flown with,toronto to cayo coco cubana airlines is the worst airline i have ever flown with my 6am flight meant i was ready to check in at 3am only to find the flight was now delayed by 6 hours to noon and then at 930 delayed again to 1430 what a complete joke and 15 for snacks is supposed to be compensation come on cubana airlines this is ridiculous
19056,srilankan airlines,4,airline staff was horrible,this airline staff was horrible airhostess is what it makes the worst not serving food properly i am a feeding mother and obviously need to drink water and have food on time after lunch they didnt provide any drinks or snacks and we need to call them and ask for it even if we ask the hostess was showing faces i asked for a glass of water she shouted and told wait and never gave that i felt so bad and she didnt even care about it
1655,air europa,2,horrible experience,horrible organization 0 control of people and 0 monitoring of biosecurity measures and protocols the fleet is handing out alcoholfree cleaning wipes that arent even antibacterial the plane looks like a jungle passengers are moving everywhere and are talking in the aisle being that it was clearly said at the beginning of the flight that crowds are not allowed in the aisles people wear the masks without covering their nose the fleet never distributed any alcohol in gel for sanitizing hands nor masks every 4 hours as it widely known and must be 100 know to airlines there is no knowledge or transparency as to cleanliness the boarding was horrible all the people piled up and the fleet of the plane controlled nothing there are like 15 air europa workers on board perhaps more and none of them are doing anything i paid to reserve my seat two days before my flight and upon arrival i was printed the boarding pass with the seat i booked when i went to my seat there was a person with the same seat as me no one in the fleet knew anything and they sent me to sit somewhere else without giving me a solution if you have claustrophobia or any reason for not being in a specific seat never fly with this airline the food felt like it was made for animals the drink selection was horrible overall horrible experience people being noisy breaking every possible rule of biosecurity and the crew was doing nothing all day i was forced to travel with this airline but if i can choose again i will never come with them again it can be seen they have horrible communication and the crew onboard was useless

8910,ethiopian airlines,8,flight offered value for money,checkin at lhr was semichaotic with no distancing and a crush as passengers with huge amounts of baggage pushed their way through there was no business priority lane the only lounge open was lufthansas uninspiring offering with beer or wine being served from a desk and a selection of food despite travel restrictions most lhr t2 travellers seemed to be retired couples boarding was slow with no priority for business but once on board it was a nice surprise to discover it had the new individualised seat layout cabin crew was quick to serve a glass of champagne and a refill the movie selection was dire wifi failed to connect to the satellite throughout the flight the food choice was beef chicken or fish and although it was served in a more premium economy style a covid precaution it was more than sufficient the cabin crew was attentive in keeping my glass full the flat bed was slightly narrow but not to extent that i was unable to sleep overall this flight offered value for money and i arrived feeling relaxed

1434,air china,7,by far the cheapest option,singapore to new york via beijing in economy total fare was sgd 847 by far the cheapest option at the time of booking the sinpek flight i had selected was cancelled more than a month before the trip with an earlier and later flight offered all flights departed and arrived on time the legroom and pitch were acceptable and the adjustable head and calfrests were much appreciated the level of cleanliness was generally good with cleaning of the lavatories by the cabin crew a decent selection of english content available in the ife system though the touchscreen was insensitive and the audio jacks and headphones had to be cajoled into producing even tinny monaural sound my preordered vegetarian meal was not loaded onto the sinpek flight due to the schedule change but the avml and vlml meals on the other sectors were satisfactory each featured a small and rather underwhelming entre along with a rotating ensemble of sides including hagendazs ice cream and upstate farms yogurt on the ewrpek sector a selection of soft drinks and chinese wine and beer were offered during regular drink runs the onboard service was polite and efficient one issue was that the layovers were extremely long however air china offers economy passengers with long layovers free transit lounge access though the contracted bcat lounge was basic it proved very useful on the return leg in summary air china offered extremely affordable and reasonably comfortable transportation

7454,copa airlines,6,friendly staff onboard,i was pleased with the performance of the friendly staff onboard they certainly made it worth flying with copa the same cant be said about the ground staff in toronto i found them to be somewhat discourteous and uncaring they seem to focus of getting the flight out rather than taking the time to be pleasant to guest they could have dont a better job organizing the boarding lines and dealing with customer questions
3728,airnorth,9,surprised by the high quality,darwin to dili an excellent flight really surprised by the high quality early morning departure from darwin led to a pretty generous breakfast frittata yoghurt coffee and juice pretty amazing for an hourlong flight and significantly more generous than what we received on our flight up from melbourne on a full priced carrier staff were friendly energetic and professional love the crocodile skin belts a nice touch of the northern territory the return leg from dili left half an hour early ran out of food options early but on an hourlong flight you can cope
8189,eastern airways,8,most impressed by the service on this flight,flew eastern airways from newcastle to aberdeen i was most impressed by the service on this flight a complimentary drink snack was a very nice gesture the flight was very smooth even though there was bad weather in aberdeen the air stewardess was very polite professional could not do enough for her customers i would recommend this airline and use it again if the need arose
15531,omni air international,4,on the tarmac waiting and waiting,vancouver to phoenix we sat on the tarmac waiting and waiting for passengers to make their connection the flight attendant already announced that everyone was on board and the captain comes up and says we are waiting for 3 more passengers what is fair to give us an on time arrival or wait for passengers and get everyone delayed no brainer
7502,copa airlines,2,this was the worst experience,this was the worst experience i have ever had with an airline the flight got delayed in bogotacolombia by an hour we arrived to panama late to make connection to another flight going to chicago the gate informed us that the flight had already left four people going to chicago including me were stranded at the airport the airline told us that they were not responsible for anything we had to look for a place to stay that night which cost an arm and a leg because they have such an inefficient process never again if they cant honor their connecting flights and it costs you 200 dollars for a hotel and you waste your time you are better off flinging with a better airline
8671,emirates,6,emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew,very friendly check in staff same goes for the lounge staff however there was only one on the front desk and was tied up selling with upgrades or lounge access which meant that we had a 10 min wait before we got access lounge itself was nice and had just been refurbished how ever food selection was average with several things having run out and not replaced flight its self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions the beef tenderloin has to be the driest toughest piece of meat to have ever been served on an airplane overall i have had better experiences on other carriers emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew plane landed on time and for the price the service was not unreasonable still a bit poor that you dont even get a limited amount of wifi in business class
21947,virgin australia,1,not allowing me to keep a seat i paid for is downright unfair,i have never not had an issue with virgin avoided for years but this time my partner and i booked a flight to cairns however my partner had to fly earlier in the week as there is no option in the online book in to relay this i thought id do the right thing not check in and get to the counter early to let them know i assumed foolishly that as i had paid for two seats i would still get allocated two seats and have the one next to me empty no because i had not checked in online all the aisle seats were taken and i was squished on my own in a middle seat their policy does not allow refunds which i am reluctantly forced to accept as a standard rip off by airlines but not allowing me to keep a seat i paid for is downright unfair i loathe unfairness and will continue to boycott virgin airlines wherever i can and urge you to do so too
15442,oman air,1,i enjoyed flying with oman air,i enjoyed flying with oman air the service food airplane customer care all that was very good i cant complain and i dont understand why people are complaining this airline is very good and i will fly with them again
19253,sun country airlines,3,i will be reconsidering book with them going forward,boarded 10 minutes late sat on the plane for an hour and a half while they loaded mail and waited 20 more minutes for live chickens to be loaded you dont book a 750am flight to depart at 940 because of mail and chickens made everyone late i will be reconsidering book with them going forward
7599,corendon airlines,4,corendon airlines customer review,cluj to antalya return and service was excellent we were offered free meals drinks crew was very nice even though its a lowcost airline i would recommend them to anyone who would like to go to turkey
19658,tam airlines,4,3x4x3 layout very tight,i flew tam airlines from so paulo guarulhos to frankfurt on a boeing 77300er and i must say is torture the seats are very tight tam uses the 3x4x3 layout which leaves very tight aircraft the seats are bad just recline the service is also poor and with little food
20355,thomas cook airlines,3,too uncomfortable to recommend,grim seating nice staff i didnt realise that the premium cabin has no additional legroom it was just so uncomfortable for me as a person of 6ft 4 ins a friend booked us on this flight as we were going as a group so i didnt get the chance to check on the legroom beforehand the staff seemed nice and professional though sorry just too uncomfortable for me to be able to recommend if you are in the first row there is a bulkhead so nowhere at all to stretch out your legs not even under a seat
3041,air transat,1,dysfunctional website and app,a dysfunctional website and app that doesnt allow ticket change or booking a special meal it leads to errors all the time no technical support no one answering the phone after hours of waiting and dozens of attempts therefore no possibilities to change my ticket or do with an agent what i cant do online no warnings about anything no one telling you anything the worst airline i ever flew with
2087,air macau,4,not a single on time departure,round trip between bangkok and tokyonarita with layover in macau both times each of the four flights were delayed between 10 minutes and an hour and a half not a single on time departure on my trip this airline seems to a have its pilots climb and descend very rapidly there are economic advantages to this type of flying but it can be uncomfortable on your ears cabin temperature inconsistent hot at times and cold at times for food fish rice was the only option on one of the legs the other also had a chicken and rice meal i am 64 so very sensitive to seat pitch i thought the seats were ok for the shorter flights but couldnt handle them for much longer aircrafts are older a320 and a321s that could use a refurbishment we got a good price for these tickets so i will say the value wasnt bad
2057,air koryo,8,air koryo customer review,i flew air koryo as part of an organized tour in and out of dprk planes were new tu204s the planes were clean and plenty of overhead luggage space crew was pleasant and efficient food okay for a short flight the overall experience was better than some airlines with 2 and 3 star ratings
6487,caribbean airlines,9,caribbean airlines customer review,posmia everything was smooth from checkin to boarding but the flight left 1hr late due to connecting pax flight attendants were friendly and the coconut bake and fish was lovely luggage allowance was good and crew informative
22390,volaris,4,standard lowcost carrier experience,they rescheduled the flight to depart 5 hours earlier than id initially booked and didnt even notify me only when checking in online the day before did i notice it had changed communication seems to be a recurring issue with volaris when ive had flights delayed 23 hours in the past even though it shows the delay on their website and in the volaris app they dont send any emailsmspush notification about it their customer service via whatsapp takes hours to respond that being said the bag drop process at mex was surprisingly quick and efficient the cabin crew were nice the flight departed on time seats were okay no recline and not much leg room snacks on board for purchase standard lowcost carrier experience in my opinion
16590,qatar airways,9,such an outstanding cabin crew,i was traveling with qatar airways from doha to dhaka bangladesh on april 17th in economy class earlier i traveled from dfw to doh in business class cabin crew who was serving us is rania rania was such an outstanding cabin crew she was very warm welcoming accommodating and went above and beyond to make the flight experience pleasant while serving dinner they ran out of my preferred meal she made sure that her colleagues on the other isles had my preferred meal and she brought it to me although i traveled in economy class from doha to dhaka her genuine care and warm disposition made me feel like i was traveling in business class she definitely upheld the standard that qatar airways promise its clientele and boast about thank you rania and thank you qatar airways
15990,philippine airlines,4,probably last time flying pal business,my first and probably last time flying pal business the flight was delayed 3 times there was no vegetarian or fish meal available in any of the flight and it was not possible to preorder the menu online no sparkling wine because unfortunately it finished so i only had a starter on bkkmnl leg and no food on mnlpom leg the lounge in bangkok had terrible food how on earth one can find such food in thailand super fat udon noodles rice and some fried snacks the lounge in manila food is not great either but better than the lounge they use in bangkok nice dumplings no in flight entertainment nor working internet on bkkmanila flight
7172,citilink,6,rather a good experience,it was rather a good experience of flying with citilink from jakarta to makassar checkin went smoothly ground staff was very polite there was a bit of a mess with the departure gate as they changed it while the monitors were showing a different one nevertheless the plane took off on time and arrived on time service was ok no free food but what was available was pretty cheap anyway i can recommend this lowcost airline and will probably use their services again in the future
9516,firefly,2,not use this airline again,i have flown with firefly in the past and rated them very highly however during my most recent trip from penang to krabi my suitcase was badly damaged during the flight and can no longer be used i reported the problem upon retrieving the suitcase at krabi airport and completed the complaint form the staff who dealt with the matter promised that firefly would contact me to arrange reimbursement but no one has been in touch and nearly a month later no one from fireflys head office has had the courtesy to respond to any of my emails will not use this airline again
22688,wings air,8,aircraft was clean cool and comfortable,jayapura to wamena with wings air plane left only half an hour late aircraft was clean cool and comfortable crew polite the lack of any meals or drinks available was not an issue on this short flight
4948,avelo airlines,1,absolutely avoid this airline,never flying with this airline ever again my 1030am flight was cancelled and rebooked to a 615pm flight without receiving any notification email text or otherwise the flight was delayed more and more until finally it got delayed to the next day at 1130am i was only aware of this flight delay because i luckily was tracking their flight status directly on their website thank goodness i did because my phone app and ticket on the browser did not update with the delays at all im shocked at not only the lack of communication and basic technology but also that avelo doesnt reimburse you for anything you only get reimbursement if you stay at a hotel i luckily was able to get last minute accommodation with a friend but unluckily that means i get no reimbursement whatsoever for saving them money by finding free accommodation all while having to deal with this back and forth the ticket is crazy expensive for what it is 45 for carry on too so was really expecting something better absolutely avoid this airline wherever possible if prices at other airlines for last minute tickets hadnt shot up id 1000 be flying with another airline right now
7267,cityjet,8,cityjet customer review,einlcyein in f50s the service in both directions was of the usual high quality i would expect from the old vlm cityjet routes the cabin crew were polite and professional and even recognised and welcomed returning passengers the captain kept us well informed of our progress for the fare i consider this exceptionally good value however they should encourage the ground staff at both airports to improve their attitude about keeping passengers informed
8722,emirates,5,ground staff are very unfriendly,ground staff are very unfriendly and not helpful making my trip unpleasant to start up with the waiting line is also quite unorganized with no supporting staffs maintaining order nonetheless i was able to check in my luggages and headed to the boarding gate with no big problems seating comfort on the economy class in b777 and food quality are above average the entertainment screen works fine no delays on departure i may not want to fly emirates in the future
18556,smartwings,7,there actually was space for legs,flew smartwings from djerba to brno pretty good plane was new and clan surprisingly for low cost airline there actually was space for legs staff were quite friendly and even offered younger son to see cockpit and pilots have been very nice to him answering all and sometimes pretty stupid questions
20239,thai smile airways,1,what a delightful flight,what a delightful flight we were very impressed nothing was too much trouble for the cabin crew and they made us feel so welcome we will be definitely flying with you again my son who lives in thailand recommended your airline thank you
2518,air new zealand,9,was very impressed,very good entertainment screens tasty food even though it was a short flight good space seats did have escape row had a very good flight was very impressed
6929,china eastern airlines,7,really not that bad,taipei to sydney via shanghai we flew return sydtpe with transit in kunming on the way to taipei and shanghai pudong on the way back to sydney in december 2019 it was our very first time travelling with china eastern and did not have high expectations to begin with since reading many of those bad reviews here is how it goes for us upon receiving my eticket i cannot use the ticket verification function on their website because the purchase was made through the third party however i was able to select seats on their website so that was good checkin in sydney was easy and quick only then we were made to realize that transit in kunming requires us to get our luggage and go through checkin desk again the staff however said that 3 hours layover should be more than enough for all that process flight from sydney to kunming spacious seats compared to the newer plane from pvg syd however lack of padding so its a bit hard to sleep on entertainment was not too bad not extensive but since my flight was overnight i slept most of the time fas were all smiley but felt a bit robotic meals both dinner and breakfast was ok for us my husband enjoyed his braised pork belly dinner didnt have the alcohol so cant comment on how good or if they had enough throughout the flight do not expect to see nice amenities kit here checkin in kunming was a problem due to the language barrier she kept insisting we dont have proof of residency but didnt relay the message to us wasted about 30 minutes on things that could have been cleared right away should the staff able to relay her concern to us than going around to her manager to finally realised she made a mistake no apologies whatsoever lounge at kunming was just sad and had so little to offer flight from kunming to taipei good seat really good fa service she tried her best to communicate with us in broken english and we really appreciated her for this redemption point after what happened in kunming airport checkin in taipei was easy and she informed us that no need to pick up the luggage in shanghai they will be transferred to our next flight to sydney good lounge at taoyuan airport was very quiet when we were there flight from tpe to pvg same good seat as kunming to taipei good light meal served not so friendly fa unfortunately flight from pvg to syd i had the best service on this leg the seat was comfortable for sleeping with nice loccitane amenities kit i have to applaud the fa serving my row he was thorough sincere and speaks english well personally explained the new procedure on landing at syd even though there is an announcement later on the fa on my husbands row however was not as attentive she didnt even ask what breakfast he likes and suddenly a western set was served overall i think its really not that bad and i wouldnt mind flying with them again if there was a good deal it probably not as nice service in economy class as many bad reviews point at but we didnt have those issues in business class all four flights left on time do notice that the fa will tell you to not use headphone anymore around 1 hour before landing
17692,scat airlines,8,i am glad i flew with them,scat has a very poor reputation but i had no problems with them check in was performed by a handling agent in almaty and as usual with any airline there it was perfunctory but efficient i had selected my seats previously online with no issues the flight started to board a little late alongside an air astana flight departing 5 minutes later to astana resulting in many passengers going to the wrong gate and being turned back there this is more an airport issue than an airline one though the flight pushed back around 5 minutes behind schedule the aircraft although rather old felt comfortable and the crew were very efficient they managed to serve candies before take off a boxed meal and a drink followed by tea and coffee and more candies before landing all for a 1 hour 20 minute flight baggage was included in the ticket price and the onboard service was friendly the price was less than many european low cost carriers would charge for their most basic service their low safety ranking nearly put me off but according to their website they are working on getting accreditation so this reassured me and i am glad i flew with them
16023,philippine airlines,4,they do not clean or maintain the toilets,i regularly go to pi on business trips 2x a year due to my bad experience in the past with pal i have been taking kal jal etc this time being post covid i decided to go with pal being familiar with covid rules in pi i also wanted to find out if the airline has changed thru the years in customer service to my surprise it did not the flight attendants were not polite bordering to being rude i have to go to the galley to get a glass of water or drink the attendants almost throw the food tray at your table with out any concern repeatedly i have this weird feeling as if they dont like their job or you are just a nobody because you are in economy class they seem to answer your questions in disgust that i refrain from asking them any question i am a polite person especially to service personnel they attendants congregate at the galleys talking about personal life half the time which reminds me of the sm sales people in manila they do not pick up things people drop at the aisle which makes the plane look trashy lastly they do not clean or maintain the toilets very disgusting out of the whole crew i only find 1 or 2 that is amiable or polite this review is for people thinking of flying pal in the future only because pal management do not read reviews or customer complaints as they do in the west
17992,sichuan airlines,5,crew were attentive and prompt,flew sichuan airlines from kathmandu to lhasa check in was quick though not friendly the flight was delayed an hour but it happens to be a common occurence on this route the radisson lounge was okay but the staff seemed lazy and seemingly uninterested in providing quality service inflight meal served was breakfast which was below par for j class but the crew were attentive and prompt for this 125 hrs flight no reason given for the delay and the flight deck crew were mute the whole journey this flight flies over the nepalese himalayas and close to everest but the crew never provided any info on when we were passing everest which was a real let down this sector is also regarded as one of the most expensive routes in the world when it comes to ticket price and flight time ratio
8131,dragonair,9,dragonair customer review,just did another trip on dragonair to busan korea hkgpus departs at 0230am with a320 before the cabin was becoming all dark cabin crew handed out a box of snack including a bun chocolate and some fruits along with a bottle of water limited seat pitch on a320 very good 3 hour flight for sleeping on the way back was departing at 8am korea time no ptv on the old a320 but nice yummy breakfast with korean style ginseng chicken with rice or scramble egg cabin crew were friendly and attentive as always hope their a320 will get new seats and ptv sometimes soon
1371,air china,5,cabin looking quite dirty,a long flight 10h cabin luggage allowance is very low 5kg the boarding process went well in milan the aircraft itself is average no signs of modernity cabin looking quite dirty small pitch in economy seats although it is said to exist wifi was never available very little variety of movies or series to watch the catering is of basic quality and the crew is not particularly nice flight was in time
21418,ural airlines,7,there are disadvantages,moscow to barcelona the airline is not bad but there are disadvantages hand baggage allowance the main disadvantage once when i was flying from samara russia to st petersburg russia we were on the bus with the doors open at 20 everyone was waiting for the late passenger when he approached it turned out that he had problems with the size of hand luggage and we continued to stand and freeze only after our disturbances we were able to persuade the representatives of ural airlines and go to the plane
8198,eastern airways,4,will not be using again,i have been using eastern airways for about a year now traveling between humberside and aberdeen for business i started to notice that when i booked some flights it would say only 4 seats left and i would have to pay the middle tier over 200 one way it was always the case i got on the flight to find that there would be about 11 people on there and plenty of empty seats what extra did i get for the higher price nothing same seat as the 165 one nothing different after spending a lot of money with this airline i now travel on train to another airport and i can get 2 flights 2 trains for less then the lowest fare available with eastern airways even flying across the sea i can get cheaper then a domestic flight trouble is some people are stuck and have to use the local airport but if the prices do not start to come down they will end up pushing everyone to other airports and little airports like humberside will end up closing its just greed if other airlines can fly at 60 a seat for a domestic flight then why cant they i will not be using again
9899,flysafair,6,very clean and great service,flysafair is the best very clean and great service i would recommend that the flight attendants who speak on the intercom do not put the phone close to there mouth as no one can hear what they say hold the intercomphone a bit further away from your mouth so people can hear clearly
17375,s7 siberia airlines,4,never saw smile of the crews,vladivostock to seoul incheon everything is lime green the planes the laboratory parts of the crew uniform and etc planes looked relatively modern the inside of planes are quite clean but laboratory always kinda dirty quality of service was decent however the few times i flew with s7 never saw one smile on any of the crews ground at gate or in the air food was terrible so was drink options however for the many cities it serves this is probably the best choice
23133,zipair,4,i was very disappointed,i just traveled from narita airport to bangkok airport on 7th may 2023 that was my 4th time traveling with the airline and i was very disappointed the counters opened 2 routes singapore and bangkok for checking in at the same time it wasnt separated well and was very confusing the c26 counter was said for bangkok checkin so i queued in the row for about 15 minutes aiming for it but then the c25 singapore counter was free and called me out i refused her because i was waiting for the c26 counter she didnt understand and asked me why i queued in this row so i told her counter c26 was said for bangkok she didnt believe me that c26 is for bangkok and walked out from the counter she realized her mistake when she saw the sign above the counter and the c26 staff told her that her counter was really for bangkok although she realized it she still didnt say any apologies to me and still asked me to queue again from the start in another row which i was frustrated i dont understand why i had to waste time there about 30 minutes when i could finish it in 15 minutes
15305,norwegian,1,why they cant refund,i purchased 4 flights for my family three months before our holiday norwegian changed two of the flight times and instead of offering a refund are charging a premium to adjust my tickets to an alternate flight i have had to rebook 10 tickets and pay twice now for each of the flights as norwegian dont take responsibility for changing flight times if its 60 mins or less i dont understand why they need to be adjusting flight times 3 months out and i dont understand why they cant refund my tickets 3 months out
12956,korean air,9,an impressive airline,just completed a flight from la to incheon and it was excellent korean airs strong points are its catering leg room in economy and in flight service the bibimbbap i had was super good and you get to enjoy it on nice korean air silverware theres also shin ramen for those who would like to enjoy a mid flight snack i also have to give a shout out to the hardworking cabin crew that were vigilant about anticipating pax needs and for defining great hospitality this other point may not be all that relevant for most but i found their inflight magazine to be top notch not riddled with useless advertisements and boring content but with excellent editorial pictures of destinations and useful travel tips conversely this is really minor but compared to major global carriers the lack of entertainment choices and wifi is the airlines weak point still got to watch a few good flicks though overall an impressive airline where the 13 hours just flew by
3981,alitalia,7,offers basic snack service,berlin to rome i had flying blue points to redeem so i used them for my flight from berlin to rome i was a bit apprehensive at first with alitalia being in receivership after having been ditched by etihad but i proceeded anyway knowing that in the unlikely event that the airline goes belly up i still have other options as with most intraeuropean flights alitalia offers basic snack service on board a drink and a snack either sweet or salty was being served on this 2 hour flight as i was seated in the exit row leg space was generous seats were leather seats in black flight attendants were smartly dressed in black pant suit with scarf emblazoned with alitalia colours
13827,libyan airlines,2,libyan airlines customer review,tuntip checkin at tunis was efficient and staff generally friendly boarding at the gate was chaotic while on the runway the plastic emergency exit covering came off the pilot came and put it back on plane then proceeded with takeoff the food was standard and staff friendliness on board ok although only with limited english skills onboard announcements were in arabic only the interior was worn emergency cards in seat pockets were still from the former owner of the plane a defunct french airline
11535,interjet,1,pay more for a better airline,toronto to merida via mexico city our flight to mexico city was a late flight no refreshments were offered until 4 hours into the flight our return flight was from merida to mexico city and then 6 hours later mexico city to toronto our connecting flight was changed to 24 hours so we took our luggage and stayed at a hotel upon returning to the airport to check in we were told we had to pay for our baggage we refused and after an hour of explaining that they had changed to original flight times they didnt charge us our flight was for 1150 pm with boarding at 1120 our flight wasnt on the board and never actually appeared on the board we went to a gate hoping we were in the right area to wait our flight time came and went and no announcement or anything finally at 130 am we were told our flight was unloading we finally boarded at around 2 am with no apology or explanation of why it hadnt shown up on the flight board or why they were so late to top it all off someone brought a cat on board in the cabin a row behind us the poor cat screamed literally the whole flight never again i will pay more for a better airline
8975,etihad airways,4,flight attendants outright rude,not worth the money paid business class service similar to that of a public tram flight attendants outright rude havent seen this attitude even in economy no bed linen or turndown service as different from emiratesturkish business class coffee machine not working for which i havent received even an apology air dhabi airport is a joke compared to dubai istanbul or singapore not fit for a decent layover business lounges packed with crying babies and dirty pampers literally every sit packed people playing videos and tiktoks on high volume staff chit chatting all flight with each other instead of serving customers not once has anyone asked whether everything was fine or i needed anything the chitchat was so loud i had trouble sleeping i had to ask the staff to keep it quiet a request that they completely ignored all for the 3500 ticket price as if this wasnt enough the epitome of the flight was at the end the business class toilet was occupied for a long time when the door opened a flight attendant came out i rushed in to brush my teeth and discovered a think air of electronic cigarette smoke you cannot confuse this smell with anything so apart from customer negligence poor service and low value for the money this airlines own employees are breaking the law and international flight regulations
4624,asiana airlines,7,flight crew are efficient,manila to chicago via seoul ground crew in manila are approachable and knowledgeable the flight crew from seoul to chicago are efficient but i noticed that they dont often serve juicesdrinks during the midflight especially when the lights are dimmed you need to call their attention if you need drinks
1119,air busan,1,customer service appears to be top,we were in jeju flying to busan then connecting to gimpo i noticed our flight was delayed and we may miss the connection i queried this with ground staff within 16 minutes our flights were changed at no cost 4 peoples luggage located dragged across the airport by tiny female ground staff identified and reloaded then we were seated in row 1 of the airline and off to gimpo totally amazing i am still astounded that this happened plus a refund on our original flight congratulations air busan if i could i would fly this airline regularly customer service appears to be top of their list
7194,cityjet,7,fas all friendly and relaxed,dublin to paris cdg business class on cityjet rj85 the middle seat is left empty in fact there were only a few business passengers on the flight so each passenger had an entire row of seats the rj85 is renowned for being very quiet and the flight was most comfortable within the limitations of operating business class simply by putting a curtain up to separate from economy the service was fine fas all irish were all friendly and relaxed a light breakfast was served and coffee was topped up as required i booked business class only because i was connecting to a long haul flight and there was no option to book c for long haul and y for the short connection otherwise it would hardly have been worth the extra money simply to get breakfast and to ensure i had noone in the seat next to me but the service was good the breakfast was basic but fine and i have no complaints
14779,monarch airlines,5,not extra leg room at all,flew monarch airlines from almeria to manchester paid for extra leg room at the front of plane when boarding we were told plane had changed and so our seats were not available however they would still give us extra leg room in a different row when got on the plane these were not extra leg room at all emailed monarch about this only to get an automated response saying our payment for the extra leg room would be returned no real apology or nothing the comments i had made in the email therefore totally ignored
12860,klm royal dutch airlines,9,staff are friendly and this flight no exception,im a big klm fan so my review is slightly biased im probably unusual in that i actually enjoy an 11 hour flight with themeven if squashed into economy this was a full flight 425 passengers all expecting to be fed watered and presumably pampered down at the other end of the plane the crew dealt with the vast numbers of people well klm staff are generally pretty friendly and this flight was no exception one massive plus point ive noticed with klm over the years is they match your formality level im quite relaxed and the crew match that by calling me by my first name etc food was adequate for such a long flight there was a main meal not long after take off followed by a midflight snack and a sandwich just before landing the beverage trolley was wheeled out a few times usual tiny airline food portions however but was quite tastyaside from a horrible coconut type dessert thing klm give bottled water instead of those weird plastic pots with the foil lid that guarantee you will drench the passenger sat on your lap in economy this is good ife with klm is always slightly disappointing yes theres a lot to choose from but the vast majority is american rubbish why the fixation with us content youre a dutch airline show some european solidarity i cant be the only one who doesnt want americans screaming at me for an 11 hour flightif i did id fly delta
10556,go first,2,worst flying experience,always resheduledelays the flights online checkin doesnt allow to select seats changed seats in flight as well due to various reasons given by staff worst flying experience not recommended
12887,klm royal dutch airlines,4,experience is very disappointing,klm has a 2x2x2 configuration in business class this means you have to wake your neighbor up in order to use the bathroom that doesnt really work in business class moreover the power outlets and the headphones ports are located behind your seat which makes it basically impossible to reach as a matter of fact every time you move your headphones are disconnected as theyre not really plugged in merely laying on a magnetic surface the planes are ancient and the experience is honestly very disappointing lots of screaming kids onboard this didnt feel like a business class flight at all
6541,cathay dragon,9,catering is slightly below my expectation,hong kong to kuala lumpur in january 2018 queue was short and check in process quick a330300 parked at the remote parking bay whereby transfer was done by airport bus the cabin crew welcomed me upon on boarding my seat no 23h is located at the 1st section of the economy class this aircraft is equipped with the newer version of ife with hd screen and 3d flight path considering this is a 3 hours 55 mins flight the quality of the in flight catering is slightly below my expectation the airline has reduced the number of portion on the meal tray in the last 2 years cabin crew are courteous and attentive but less friendly compare to some major airlines in china i find that the crew are being very passionate and alert when i requested for a comment form after meal and the senior flight attendant immediately came to check if anything was wrong which they can improve on to conclude the overall flight journey is still an impressive one
16516,qantaslink,8,qantaslink customer review,recently flew drwgovcnsdrw and flights were on time and the service was very good cain crew were excellent on the drwgovcns and pretty good on the return cnsdrw sector i always like flying on the b717
14453,malaysia airlines,8,seat comfort was moderate,smooth experience the flight is on time and proper boarding announcements seat comfort was moderate the are no ife but we can connect to wifi for entertainment the movie collection can be improved as well as the connection good food as i book special meal on this flight the cabin crew as at its best
11663,iraqi airways,9,b737 had good leg room,i took 3 domestic flights with iraqi airways from basra to baghdad and then a return to sulaymaniyah one was on a smaller bombardier and the others on a b737 the basra flight was delayed a couple of hours because of fog no problems with that it happens i missed my next flight on a different ticket to erbil the later flights were all full so they changed my ticket to sulaymaniyah at no cost all aircrafts were good particularly the b737 which was not very old at all the b737 had good leg room was clean in flight entertainment and a reasonable snack was served the smaller bombadier whilst a little older was perfectly ok overall a good experience

3649,aircalin,9,aircalin customer review,we travelled to noumea on this airlinecode share with qantas on the outgoing leg and aircailin on the return leg the outgoing trip with qantas was so substandard with qantas there was no entertainment we could see only two screens out of 5 visible in our section of the cabin and the meal served was inedible however to my surprise the service was fantastic the food was not only edible but enjoyable the service was swift polite and plentifulthe brandy at the end of the meal was a lovely touch individual screen for movies was also much appreciated i would have no hesitation in flying this airline again or recommending it to friends
11287,iberia express,2,penny pinching rip off,madrid to manchester with iberia express and paid 350 euros one way to have a little extra space and a simple hot meal usually provided on this route the meal has been substituted now with snacks such as olives in a sealed bag and a powder cup soup but they have the nerve to display a soup bowl on their brochure iberia has become a penny pinching rip off
4257,american eagle,6,unfortunately not wonderful,our american eagle flight from srq to charlotte flt 5521 departing srq at 130 pm on april 13 was unfortunately not wonderful the flight attendant for business was curt draconian in approach and very stingy with snacks i have flown this route numerous times and when i have asked for more than one item it was gladly given not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant and even then when she returned and i watched her stow the leftover snacks and i asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part the other issue is that in prior flights on crj 900s i have always been able to stow a rollaboard which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft when i asked this attendant why the policy had changed she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law ie the need to check rollaboards you can check your records to see how often i have flown this route from either srq to charlotte or dca and i was always allowed to bring a bag on board i sense that my question which was very diplomatically phrased was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction i have flown american for years and prior to the pandemic was in executive platinum status for many of them it is discouraging to have had a rude attendant particularly when we paid to be in business class it was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities please understand that i dont like giving negative information nor do i wish to complain these are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them but my attitude is always positive and welcoming and i expect no less than those whose service i have procured and this was clearly substandard
17005,royal brunei airlines,9,value for money,melbourne to bangkok return this royal brunei airlines flight is through brunei and melbourne to brunei is on the boeing 787 and then an airbus from brunei to bangkok all flights left on time or were early on arrival my luggage was amongst the first off and i was given a priority pass for leaving melbourne and for arrival and departure from bangkok between melbourne and brunei and for the return sector the business cabin was full very good food for all meals with reasonable sized portions i would have preferred earlier serving of the meal on the brunei melbourne sector so that i could have had more sleep the cabin attendants were helpful and efficient the seats were comfortable and the b787 was a flat bed on the shorter sector it was a reclining seat with a reasonable recline and good space for my legs ife was a bit limited and there should have been more choice in the array of films that were offered i regularly fly from melbourne to bangkok and nearly always fly with royal brunei they do not serve alcohol brunei is an islamic country but the level of service and the value for money is very good
20449,thomson airways,3,delayed by over an hour,flew thomson from leeds bradford to paphos flight was delayed by over an hour due to a problem with the aircraft on its previous flight which couldnt be helped when we were called to board it took us over another hour before we got moving and we were left to roast in a cabin with no air conditioning as the auxiliary engine that enables air conditioning without the main engines being used was faulty again this couldnt be helped but my problem was with the fact they boarded us despite how the flight was delayed even further with no explanation otherwise the flight went without a hitch but it took us nearly two hours to finally get off the ground
13337,lan airlines,4,lan airlines customer review,la800 26 apr syd to akl airline food reached a new low when i flew from sydney to auckland stale panini type bread enclosing ham and cheese when i complained about it i was told it came from new zealand why and when the flight originated in sydney so should have the bread and baked that day this tasted at least two or three days old what are they thinking they are competing with emirates on the same route on the way back i flew with the latter there could not have been a bigger contrast i will not fly with this airline again if i have a choice on this route because of the food alone
20177,thai lion air,4,complaint is about check in,udon thani to bangkok my complaint is about their check in staff at udon thani airport we never had any baggage to check in only had 1 approved cabin bag weighing 10 kgs in total this was for 2 passengers so well within their 7kg per pax limit we checked in i was told you cannot take that bag into the cabin i pointed out it was approved size cabin baggage but in the eyes of the check in staff there was no way they were going to let us board our flight they made us go to a shop buy 2 plastic bags transfer our clothes from my approved cabin bag into these 2 plastic bags what made me angry was that there were a lot of bags in the cabin either the same size some even bigger than mine there was no problems with the actual flights apart from a 20 minute delay on both sectors but that happens
2771,air serbia,4,will try to avoid this airline,belgrade to kiev my experience with air serbia did not start well whilst i was booking my ticket online i was asked me for my visa details for ukraine despite the fact that im a british citizen and dont need a visa the online form would not allow me to skip this information so i ended up having to call customer service to be fair to air serbia it was not difficult to get through to an agent and the phone call was charged at a normal rate once i was connected to an operator we cleared up the issue and then the lady said oh by the way i can see you have not paid for any luggage i told her with some indignation that i had paid for an extra suitcase and eventually she found this to be correct between then and my flight i also received numerous emails telling me that i had not paid for luggage once i arrived at the airport the idiocy continued on air serbias part i was once again asked for my visa and the check in person had to call someone to ask them if i needed visa eventually someone confirmed i did not then they said again did you know that you havent paid for extra luggage speechless once on the plane everything was fine i will try to avoid this airline in future they are also exorbitantly expensive on many routes
1101,air botswana,4,air botswana customer review,maun to joburg got on plane and when arrived in joburg our luggage did not no ones did found out afterwards that if it is hotter than 40c they will not take luggage if plane is full wish someone would have informed us we didnt get our luggage back until zanzibar 2 days later and many frustrating moments in between tired plane needs an overhaul or the insides redone they had a quick stop which was not on the itinerary or the ticket in gabone it was to turn staff over or something but couldnt get off plane and the 10 minutes turned into 40 without ac doors opened and 40c
8922,etihad airways,4,many had broken entertainment systems,the flights departed and arrived on time the connecting flights were good and the staff were helpful and friendly but everything else was pretty bad we had a very old boeing 777 plane for a 14 hour flight and many people had broken entertainment systems the food was barely edible disgusting in fact wont be paying 3600 again for such bad service prefer emirates singapore airlines or qantas
17134,royal jordanian airlines,6,attendants are practically invisible,the boeing 787 is relatively new and the economy seats have great legroom the food quality is decent and the time between meals is not too long but dont board the flight super hungry as the food might not be enough inflight entertainment is decent and provides enough options to kill time on a long flight amman airport is modern and has so decent food options also the petra lounge is very nice and doesnt get very crowded if you have a tight connection they may hold the flight for you luggage made the connection amman airport is very poorly organized there is a serious lack of professionalism upon arrival there is an initial security screening for connecting passengers it looks as though this security station was shoved into a hallway without the architects knowledge the line is chaotic and nobody has thought to add ropes they also dont communicate what is going on so most passengers are unsure of where to go or what to do also passengers travelling to the us canada have to have their passports and visas checked before passing security but when i was there one of the two agents working this counter abruptly left leaving about 100 passengers with tight connections in a panic nobody communicated anything about what was going on for us canada flights there is yet another security station and here too nobody has thought about adding ropes to organize the line up note this is the third line you have to wait in when connecting despite having not appropriately resourced the airport to handle large volumes for some reason they schedule multiple us canada flights within 30 mins of each other so the 800 or so passengers totally overwhelm the airport facilities during high season the flight attendants are practically invisible when a meal is not being served they just lounge in the galley at the back you need to use the call button to get any service but they seem to resent you for disturbing them when you do so there are long periods of time up to 4 hours between meals where no drinks are served on most other long haul airlines the cabin crew will walk the aisles to pass around cups of water every few hours it took almost two hours to remove the meal trays from the seats they seem to keep the cabin quite war which makes the lack of water problem much more acute
4941,avelo airlines,3,still a very bad experience,travelled to and from new haven to ft myers on avelo never again a neighbor recommended them new haven is reasonably close so we tried it big problems at new haven airport not much parking and expensive no real gates you stand out in the cold for 1015 minutes boarding the jet from the ground the planes are fine standard boeing 737s the airfare itself is relatively low cost but the add ons are very high 45 per carryon or checked bag each way 180 for checked bags for 2 persons rt add 130 for seat assignment rt you pay 2737 for a seat assignment they also demanded i remove a standard phillips electric toothbrush from my checked bag ridiculous in 25 years of flying all over the world only avelo has forced me to remove a toothbrush from my checked bag they said was fine to carry it onboard in my carryon bag go figure incompetence the website is also very confusing the site caused me to double book and double pay for my checked bags i had to request a refund due to the confusion online when i checked in all in all a very negative experience they dont even offer any water on their flights at all 3 hour flight tweed new haven is definitely not ready for prime time they have limited parking no gates not enough room for waiting passengers a very bad experience if you have elderly or wheel chair passenger definitely do not fly with avelo or thru new haven they will freeze on the ground tarmac boarding or trying to board their flight the price for a professionally run airline like american jetblue or southwest is really not much higher maybe even less and they fly out of real airports like bdl jfk laguardia and white plains no drink no food no wifi nada i tried them once but i will not fly them again the flights themselves were actual ok the flight attendants also were friendlyok though they clearly have almost nothing to do in the air no service flights just 1hour late but still a very bad experience a mistake

148,aegean airlines,5,i had to pay 50 euros more,i showed them my ticket to board on the plane they thought my suitcase was big then weighed it and also found my bagpack too big they never showed me the number shown on the weight scale or informed me about why my bagpack was considered too big instead they were rude after me insisting on knowing how many kilos my suitcase was they told me it was 9 kilos instead of 8 for which i had to pay 50 euros more i feel that economy class passengers are treated with no respect in the airport and aegean attempts to take more money from them making their life difficult in their airport i would not recommend flying with aegean a sandwich and a cup of coffee on the airplane is not worthy of such bad customer service
17706,scoot,2,flight was delayed for 5 hours,my flight in february was delayed for 5 hours it was a morning flight and they sent an email during midnight 3am telling me that flight been changed to noon but when i was in airport the flight was further delayed for another hour i boarded and the plane went on circling for another 1 hour flight attendees were rude to me scoot gave me a 30 voucher during the flight delay probably the only slight saving grace however the staff at the counter was just playing her phone texting zero regards about customer service or much known to the delay i bought the wifi it was not even working despite trying countless times it was not an entirely cheap flight either like those promotion deals got it at 250

4956,avelo airlines,3,customer service is terrible,avelos customer service is terrible hold times greater than an hour our plane had a technical issue which can happen but we were left in the dark relative to what was going on very poor communication our departure time was supposed to be 630 pm and we ended up leaving at 130 am apparently the needed plane repair parts were in new haven so they flew a plane to charleston with the parts and took us back to new haven on the return flight if that wasnt the case im not sure what we would have done the airport closed at 430 am there was no guidance from avelo they need to do better

8232,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,flew with eastern nclsvg as they offered more suitable schedule over widere who i would normally fly with tiny j41 with 18 passengers for the 1h30 flight hand baggage had to be surrendered at aircraft steps as limited space onboard bag was laptop bag size so keep hand baggage to a minimum if you really want it in the cabin 2 cups of tea shortbread hot towel and sweets before takeoff and landing all complimentary made such a difference to the flight flight attended very friendly and welcoming and flight deck kept you well updated on arrival time and weather would fly eastern again however price can be very steep so book as soon as you know the dates of your holiday it pays off to book early

19757,tame,9,great customer service,guayaquil to baltra i wish to say a few positive words to review my trip to galapagos with this nice airline which proved to be punctual reliable and with great customer service i had to anticipate my return flight from baltra to guayaquil so i decided to call the customer service on their international line i was a bit scared as reding the previous reviews i was expecting the worse actually the customer assistant on the phone not only spoke perfect english but also managed to help me with the change easily and at no additional cost in few minutes the new ticket was delivered to my email together with all the information regarding the entrance requirements to galapagos the whole checkinboarding process was easy and quite fast both ways and departure and arrival time perfectly punctual the plane was probably a bit outofdate but the crew and the pilots did their best to make the flight as pleasant as possible drinks and a snack were served during both flights and we got lots of announcements from the cockpit smooth takeoff and landing completed the journeys so overall a nice experience and nothing to complain i have to say that i travelled much better than with other airline companies
11995,jet airways,3,staff borderline rude,dubai to hong kong via mumbai cheap flight tickets but you understand why old aircraft no entertainment on flight screens dont work dodgy seats all this to arrive in mumbai to discover our flight was delayed 2h with no warning or compensation like a lounge access for example airport staff borderline rude and sleeping at the desk really showing their annoyance when you approach them flights delayed both on our way to and from hong kong cheap yes but at your own risk
1582,air europa,1,its even worse than ryanair,worst company ever worst customer service ever always late dont give you any information make you wait for hours for nothing my flight got cancelled and i had to struggle for months to get the eu legal compensation they do not answer your messages their flight are always latecancelled and good luck for the wait and get the compensation cause it will never come a company to flee from never take this company really its even worse than ryanair
6901,china airlines,3,not fly china airlines anymore,jakarta to taipei the flight was supposed to depart at 1410 from jakarta to taipei but it was delayed for 1 hour 40 minutes due to technical problem no reconciliation provided by the airline for this delay to the passengers our first time to fly china airlines and disappointing they shall not fly problematic aircraft unless that is all they can afford will not fly china airlines anymore
21313,united airlines,2,seats did not recline,paid to upgrade our seats and felt like we got a downgrade because our seats did not recline supposed to have been electronic device charging stations between the seats and there werent any on the plane at all one of your flight attendants was very rude will never fly this airline again there was also supposed to be onboard wifi and it wouldnt work either
4330,american eagle,6,service was adequate,the service was adequate food beef salad was adequate equipment old and tired cabin crew friendly however there appears to be something jinxed about this flight second time in 18 months we have flown this route and both times significant delays this time it was 90 minutes the frustrating aspect was the number of gate changes six of them three of them in the last 60 minutes before departure the same number as the last time
18035,silkair,4,silkair is really very ordinary,cochin to singapore the positive is that we left and arrived in good time however the price does not justify what you actually get premium price very old plane with no personal screens note you can download their app to watch a variety the food was dreadful served at something like midnight i opened the foil and recoiled it was that bad fortunately i kept dropping off to sleep which helped the flight pass faster overall if i was choosing this route in future i would just go with the cheapest option as silkair is really very ordinary
22280,vlm airlines,4,vlm airlines customer review,lcyamslcy on codeshare with klm cityjet on rj85s both flights on time outbound flight nearly empty return flight full on both flights a drink and a good sandwich were offered although as the outbound flight was mid morning breakfast may have been more appropriate cabin crew attentive on both flights though they were rushed to serve all passengers on the return flight given the heavy loading
7712,croatia airlines,4,croatia airlines customer review,lgwzagskp on older a319 first sector delayed about 20 minutes but made up time in the air ordered a gluten intolerant meal on the croatia airlines website no gluten intolerant meal available on flight second sector delayed about 30 minutes no gluten intolerant meal available again landed at skp late and sat on taxiway for 20 minutes with no explanation given
1050,air berlin,8,the airline looks better,berlin tegel to bucharest i would start my review with the regret that air berlin has stopped flying to bucharest and those were one of the last flights operated by them i know it is tough to keep pace with ryanair but since air berlin has moved towards a quality service experience for its customers maybe it would have been nice to get this experience on this route too i must say that since i fly air berlin and that is a lot of time i only had once or twice that my flight was delayed and those flights tofrom bucharest were both ahead of schedule i have read it is not always the case but from my experience and point of view i was really impressed to see so many flights on time the aircrafts they are flying are new i suppose the kept only the new ones in their fleet after the restructuring last year and as a topbonus platinum i always get a seat with extra legroom which makes flying with them a joyful experience there are some things that are disturbing the inflight entertainment system only shows ads of air berlin and their partners together with their destinations over and over again this becomes too much after some time and they never change they have an app which you can use on your own device for wifi and entertainment but for my surprise you had to pay for watching tvseries as well not only for using the wifi they are many airlines which offer this service for free another thing that i find not right are the prices for the inflight snacks and drinks i understand that this is a new market strategy is it really part of that high quality experience they are talking about but there are operators offering decent prices not 35 for a mineral water and the coffee was really bad a bag exactly like tea infused in hot water i would expect more quality from their famous signature coffee i think things are changing and the airline looks better like it used to be some years ago the cabin crew members are more friendly but there is still much to do many people say it has the corporation mentality and they attention for client is low and that is partially true i think being closer to the client in any way will make this airline better
22503,volotea,9,friendliness of the company,highlight the friendliness of the company the good price ratio mainly on domestic flights and the customer service that for me is very important to talk to people and not machines it does not charge hand luggage it allows you to check it in for free and if you are a priority you can take it in the cabin i recommend it to my friends
12112,jet2com,9,cant fault them,i cannot believe some of the reviews on here we have flown with jet2 on a flight only basis also the last time on a package to menorca cant fault them service excellent plane good and the amount of staff to see you through check in etc was brilliant and very helpful recently returned from turkey with tui hotel very good however tui changed our flight to a smartlynx flight that was rubbish it was so cramped i am 5 foot and was so glad had an aisle seat the 2 tui staff on board were not the best for customer service would i go with tui again no would i fly with jet2 again yes in fact flying with them again in november
20893,transavia,2,disgrace and very rude,im calling the airline just now had to wait 45 minutes asked about the pcr test operator acts as if he never heard about it i say you sell trips to greece so you must know what are the conditions and he hangs up the phone for weeks on end there are waiting lines for 5060 minutes and they never fix it disgrace and very rude customer unfriendly
19907,thai airasia,6,incredibly cheap,the flatbed advertised and paid for was not available on this particular aircraft however had a row to myself food surprisingly good very good cabin service and check in main criticism is whilst a tired interior acceptable being filthy is not 9 hours long way without in flight entertainment and no internet connectivity available but incredibly cheap
5234,bahamasair,8,i feel very safe with them,freeport to nassau i see a lot of negative reviews and im really not sure why ive flown bahamasair my whole life and while theyre not the best in the world i feel very safe with them i experienced a slight delay my last time flying but i trust every delay with any airline is for a reason and put my safety above impatience ive only flown on their newer aircrafts within the past 6 months ive been flying more frequently so i cant really remember what the older planes are like but the new ones are great clean and bright on the inside the crew are kind as most bahamians are the flights i take are always under 45 mins and completely stressfree like i said i dont remember what the old planes are like so i only speak for the new planes but i prefer them to a lot of other airlines ive been on including american ones i know bahamasair pilots to be very talented fliers and thats whats most important to me its just a plus that the interior looks nicer now and since i dont experience any extreme delays i really have nothing to complain about
18700,south african airways,3,not even an apology since,on flight sa203 to jfk new york 21 june 2018 the entertainment etc was not working not only our family of five but all the passengers on the flight the staff did not know how to resolve the problem served dinner and vanished leaving one staff member in the galley who i did not see once came round to offer water the staff emerged again for breakfast service and advised us to take the matter further with customer services from saa we reported the incident got a reference number and not even an apology since
1618,air europa,5,the service was very poor,i flew in december to london to bogota in business class the staff was amazing and food and all the others service was excellent but i return on friday arriving yesterday afternoon to london in economy class and the service was very poor we were offered just one meal in the night of the departure and for the rest of the trip we had to paid the other meal as i know the other airlines are offering two meals when the journey is long making us to pay the other meal and we have to pay for the headphones while other airlines offer this service free
4960,avelo airlines,6,pay extra for the carry on bag,so far i flied twice thru avelo airline this year i didnt not have much other problems with this airline except their bag policy i thought the airfare was pretty cheap when i made the reservation thru online but when i got to the airport to check in at the desk the employee said i may have to pay extra for the carry on bag their policy said i can take the bag in the plane as long as the size of the bag is under their required size i didnt pay for the bag that time but he said i have to pay from next time
6776,cebu pacific,7,for short flights its okay,bangkok to manila in november 2019 as this is a lowcost airline the service is nofrills nevertheless the ground service is good not the best but i suggest more checkin counters the flight departed on time and arrived on time while this may not be the same on other flights they are improving on their ontime performance cost for money is good considering i only paid half of what i would usually pay if i chose a fullservice carrier for this route the legroom was a little bit crampy but you get what you paid for this a330 operated by cebu pacific is infamous for its cramped seating configuration i wouldnt recommend this for a longhaul flight but for short flights its okay you get to your destination on the cheapest price while the product quality is still there
1761,air france,6,never encountered such incompetence,shame on air france for its disgraceful performance and for doing nothing thus far to settle a claim for clothes and incidentals i had to buy after my luggage was delayed last december when returning from guinea to washington dc in business class i must have now called air france a dozen times to find out the status of my claim each time i get bounced around from one agent to another each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever one agent today told me that the only way to communicate with af is via social media and suggested i try twitter and facebook ive already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response ive now escalated the matter with my firm and with amex which did the booking as my companys corporate travel partner shame on air france ive never encountered such incompetence
4521,arik air,9,arik air customer review,i have just returned from a trip to lagos nigeria in economy class from heathrow i can not fault the aeroplane there was lots of leg room and my partner and i are not short at 5ft10 and 6ft2 good entertainment selection and plenty of food and drink throughout the journey all the staff were welcoming and the plane was clean my only complaint would be that both food options on the way out were spicy nigerian dishes but this is only because i am fussy if you like spicy food you will love the selection however on the way back there was a non spicy dish which was lovely i would not hesitate to fly with arik again
21835,virgin america,6,virgin america customer review,when i flew with vx i was impressed however there were a few problems my screen froze a lot and my seat barely reclined i did like that there was a good selection of music and that you could watch live tv overall the flight was great
9229,eva air,9,one of the finest business class,tokyo to toronto via taipei i must say this is one of the finest business class i had the pleasure to fly in flight attendants on both flights were excellent service quick and accommodating food was great the flight attendants all had been extremely polite and always inquiring if they can be of assistance the in charge came around and introduces herself to all the business passengers plane was extremely clean on both flights washroom was obviously was continually cleaned during the flight i would fly this airline again and would highly recommend eva air
5212,ba cityflyer,8,ba cityflyer customer review,lcyglalcy return new embraer 170 excellent and comfortable flight heavy fog caused flight to be diverted to london stansted on return trip obviously outside airlines control but meant long delay in waiting for coach transfer back to london city everything well organised although we had to wait for passengers from a second diverted flight to also arrive and join the coach transfer across town whilst inconvenient there was realistically nothing that airline could have done about the situation flights good transfer a bit slow
12613,jetstar pacific,5,jetstar pacific customer review,after reading all of the reviews warning us of delays and cancelled flights we opted to fly jetstar pacific from hcm to danang fully aware of the ramifications for our actions the price was too good to resist and we couldnt see the point of paying triple that with vietnam airlines check in was a slight issue with flights being cancelled left right and centre the poor staff did their best to deal with an array of angry and difficult customers but what do you expect for the money you paid our flight was delayed 10 hours but staff were lovely and moved us to an earlier flight so we only had to wait 5 hours in saying this we noticed all of the vietnam airlines flights were delayed as well due to weather or late aircrafts i was happy we hadnt paid an excessive amount to still be sitting around at the airport if you want to fly out of hcm i would recommend jetstar for their excellent prices however next time i would opt to get the bus and avoid delays altogether
8174,druk air,7,druk air customer review,i was impressed by druk air though admittedly we were business class good food very comfortable seats 2x2 and professional friendly informative staff we flew delhi khtamandu paro and the meal was excellent on board sit on the left for the omost amazing view of 8 of the 10 highest mountains in the world helpfully pointed out by the pilots commentry a319s modern comfortable well maintained and toilets clean business class is definately worth the small supplement exceptional helpfulness of the airline when we were stranded by bad weather in paro
7497,copa airlines,3,avoid if you can,leaving from san jose to panama city my flight was delayed there was much confusion and delay in updating the screens of letting the passengers know they didnt have any satisfying or complete answers concerning any of us being able to get help in panama with our missed layover to lax the flight crew in the cabin did admirably and only gave other passengers seemingly trivial problems from panama city to lax we had to wait hours after flying in to panama before even knowing if wed have flights or where people would be going before reaching their destination the ground service was laughable it was one man trying his best albeit not even close to being able to handle the situation with another service member focused on the next flight for the area sometimes both of them were preoccupied with making announcements or just repeating details to passengers instead of helping us with our issue of being delayed take that as you will others were upset that they would not even adhere to their policies and just intended to let people out to dry due to delays they were not taking any responsibility for the situation would not put people up in hotels anymore or give them shuttles or any similar accommodation because as i was told this was ceased since covid and thats part of their new restrictions allow people to just congest the airport due to delays while also having all over the airport you cant sit or lay down on carpet due to covid safety guidelines it was so contradicting and beyond that they charged for wifi past 30m unless you paid to stay in an overpriced lounge for 8 hours that i heard from a lady you couldnt even sleep in and theyd keep waking you up to prevent it those last two parts are more on the airport than airline but the entire thing was a grossly obvious shakedown copa is just aiding and abetting by stranding passengers there instead of helping them all that being considered after waiting for hours i talked to a man that while he gave me questionable reasons for why they couldnt do much and arent responsible nor had anything else to do than the bare minimum i was not worried about these other issues as much i was quite happy he was able to give me a boarding pass for the following morning for my next 2 connections i was going from sjo to panama city to lax and had my last layover there before finally one additional flight that was with another airline fortunately and he checked all the other flights at my behest to see if i could find something faster or more reasonable there wasnt but i appreciated the effort and in the specific time frame i was talking to him the speed of getting me what i needed and answering my questions though i was prepared all in all they acted in a way that the idea of a delay was foreign to them they didnt have any standard procedures to handle it they had no sufficient answers and generally no answers to your questions unless you knew what to ask be it about luggage flights where to stay or what to do they gave no thought to our situation besides getting us on the next available flight in my case i had been up for a very long time and was hellbent on getting to the us so i didnt have much in terms of complaints and found the bare minimum acceptable in my case but i sympathized with all the others that got completely fd over neve rmind reviews cant contain profanity in effort to censor opinions avoid if you can at all reasonable costs
4605,asiana airlines,7,did not load my luggage,new york to osaka via seoul i like asiana airlines in general their planes are new and they provide reliable service they dont always give a professional impression but i think they still provide a high level service i was disappointed this time as they did not load my luggage and i had to spend three days without it they acted as if they bore no blame at all i hope they improve customer service to the same level as their other aspects
18862,spicejet,5,the service was what was expected,i had booked this flight a month before flying as it came at a very cheap and reasonable rate the web check in for the flight was fine and i had opted for the auto seat selection without getting charged a fare for seat selection so the boarding pass was given to me 12 hours before departure the check in and baggage drop was smooth the boarding started a bit late but we made up for that en route noted that i was flying on a 737 max 8 type aircraft which had much bigger overhead storage bins and the seat pitch on board was on the generous side which was appreciated also the plane was much quieter however when boarding most of the flying attendants were busy working in the galleys and were not wishing the passengers which was rather unusual also it was observed that in the back of my seat pocket the safety card was not present which was not good at all as this document is very necessary the safety instructions and general service also seemed to be rushed on board the cabin it felt as though the staff just wanted to get things through perhaps these factors along with the lack of staff friendliness highlight the issues that the airline is going through at the moment it is to be noted that there is an onboard wifi named spicescreen which one can connect to their mobile devices free of charge it had a decent selection of movies podcasts magazines which was much appreciated the flight landed on time and baggage collection was done appropriately on the whole for the cheap fare that was paid the service was what was expected and its true that even though the airline is going through challenges there are definitely aspects that should be taken care of
18199,silver airways,2,they are very disorganized the most basic airline,we flew direct from key west to tampa my fianc and i checked 2 bags identical bags we get to tampa and only his bag is there we find some lady that nonchalantly tells us to go to the ticket counter we tell the guy our bag didnt arrive he asks for my id and phone number gives it back and says nothing else so i say after a minute or two can we have an update he says hes waiting to hear back from his supervisor we go sit down and wait 45 minutes later he comes back and says they dont know where my bag is and they are waiting to hear from key west he said you can leave and ill call you when he hears back 5 hours later no one has called so i scour the internet looking for a number that actually works for the tampa silver counter finally get someone to pick up and they still havent located my bag 1 hour later someone calls me saying it got left in key west and will be to tampa by 830 i say so do i just go to the belt he goes no come to the ticket counter with your id so i go back at 830 theres a sign saying the ticket counter is closed for the night i roll my eyes and go down to the belt and thankfully its there i emailed customer relations and he said my bag didnt make the flight because of weight restrictions which is fine but why did no one tell me and it took 6 hours to locate my bag they are very disorganized the most basic airline no wifi no tvs no drink service no ramp to the plane you have to walk outside forever just not worth it and the flights were 400 a piece the company is low budget all around
13668,level,3,utter lack of customer service,boston to barcelona because level is a subsidiary company if an issue arises that needs an immediate resolution for the customer it will go unresolved because level customer support is nonexistent and communication with iberia has to go through the customer himherself and across separate computer systems critical information is lost in translation i was prevented from boarding due to an issue of dates in the passport before expiry on the same flight another family was sent home without help for the same reason and a solo passenger was left unhelped due to a 1 lettermismatch between the name he entered online when reserving his ticket and the name in his id no ground staff was able to help him the level manager on shift was verbally hostile and offered no resolution no way of communicating with iberia to look into flight change or other solutions and no alternative options only the window clerk offered sheepishly a personal suggestion and gave me a phone number to contact iberia when my cell phone had connectivity issues in that particular part of the airport i was informed that level had no phone line i could use instead to speak with iberia i had to borrow a cell phone from another passenger to call iberia then i was told the only option was to change my flight which the level staff could not do with their laptops so for that the level manager had to enter a note in the system confirming i had shown up for checkin by that time the manager had left for the gate before even all passengers had checked in in other words checkin and boarding functions overlap in time and only 1 manager covers both the checkin clerk tried to enter a note in the computer system despite not having the credentials for that type of annotation in the system but that did not get registered on the iberia end as a consequence iberia was unable to change my flight despite having telephone record of me having shown up for checkin and i lost the ticket this illustrates that despite the convenience of pricing there is a risk of lost fights should any issue arise due to the utter lack of customer service
6848,china airlines,7,an inconsistent experience,los angeles to denpasar via taipei checkin at lax was smooth they gave us a transfer sleeve to store boarding passes for later segment which was a nice touch we had a remote gate far away and had to be shuttled by bus that experience wasnt very pleasant as we had to wait inside the bus for a very long time despite having reservation for four seats traveling as a family there was no available overhead storage all four of us had requested special meals but the flight attendants started serving us regular meal it was only after we showed them our boarding passes that they served our special meals the overall ambiance seating comfort and ife were excellent both b777300er and a330300 were tastefully decorated the service between taipei and bali segment was far superior to what we experience between la and taipei the service on our final segment from tpe to lax fell below the mark the flight attendants serving us in economy didnt smile and were quite rude while interacting with us so while friendly service was absent in tpelax segment the wifi worked well on b777300er overall china airlines offered an inconsistent experience where the positives outweighed the negatives so we will still fly with them again
6543,cathay dragon,7,inflight meal has deteriorated,hong kong to changsa check in was relatively quick this flight was operated by cathay dragon a320200 boarding for cathay dragon narrow body aircraft are either at north satellite concourse terminal or outside parking bay this flight was at the north satellite concourse airport bus was used to transfer from main terminal to north satellite concourse terminal marco polo member can board the aircraft at a special lane for frequent flyers cabin crew welcome once boarded this aircraft has been refurbished with new cabin painted with new livery ife is only available by mobile device or smart gadgets by downloading ka studio apps soon after take off the cabin crew distribute paper bag which contains pastry and a packet of lemon tea hot meal was not available for economy class passengers as the load for this flight was light cabin crew spent most of the time at the galley soon after they collected the rubbish i noticed cathay dragon in flight meal has deteriorated over the past few years meal portion for instance is getting smaller overall cabin service is satisfactory though there are still room for improvement
22619,wamos air,7,the staff were so great,gatwick to denver i was placed on a wamos flight by norwegian and almost cancelled due to all the terrible reviews but i didnt find it that bad at all we brought our own movies to watch and our own food which i normally do on a flight anyway as i like healthy stuff ive had worse legroom on other flights and the staff were more friendly and helpful than many others ive known and i fly a lot the plane was pretty old but perfectly functional the staff were so great that i told them id write a review because i felt that the pasting theyre getting online is unfair and makes us travellers look rather spoilt to be honest
8787,estonian air,6,estonian air customer review,arntllarn flew from the uk via stockholm on an sas ticket the leg from arn was with estonian air on a new crj900 economy cabin only has foodsnacks for purchase i did not partake so cannot comment upon the choice the flight itself was ontime both ways with clear announcements inn estonianrussianenglish the flight was less than an hour so no need for any inflight entertainment but an interesting multilingual airline magazine was provided along with a choice of some newspapers in various languages airline has some codeshares with other carriers in the region and provides a good connection to other scandinavianbaltic destinations
2176,air malta,2,would not recommend this airline,first time flying with air malta from frankfurt to malta and malta to berlin txl using their old a320 and a319 i would say this airline is worse than lowcost airlines serving the same route my both flights delayed about 20 minutes nevertheless they arrived intime as scheduled what i have paid for the ticket was not equal to the service which i got drinks and snacks for the economy passengers are for a fee the seats were dirty i assume as their airbus was a lease plane hence i would not recommend this airline to fly to malta better to have a stopover but good services
20884,transavia,4,there were so many other passengers not wearing their masks properly,this is the third time i have flown transavia since covid entered our world twice round trip pariscrete and recently from paris to tivat montenegro each time despite making repeated announcements in various languages about how mask wearing is mandatory the stewardsesses walk by the people with masks around their necks or their noses out and dont say a word the photos below are the men across from me at the start of the flight and towards the end as you can see no change over a 25 hour journey and these photos are the ones i managed to take discretely there were so many other passengers not wearing their masks properly
1024,air berlin,4,need a better terminal,san francisco to berlin was good attentive staff the arrival in berlin was dismal baggage was slow even with priority the plane lands and a bus takes you to the terminal the trip from berlin to paris scheduled for noon or so was resceduled to 6pm for unknown reasons since they dont tell you so i requested and got a flight for the next day arriving at the same terminal the route to the gate was up 30 feet of stairs into an upstairs tunnel down 30 feet back to the terminal without conveniences but lots of duty tree then back into a bus carry bags onto the plane this time with bags because i assume luggage service at cdg equally bad they need a better terminal
309,aeroflot russian airlines,8,service was entirely satisfactory,the premium economy service was entirely satisfactory the seat doesnt have a lot of recline but the legroom was fine for a 61 185 cm person and i was comfortable for the whole eighthour trip i liked the food well enough and appreciated having actual metal cutlery though serving wine in a paper cup seemed a bit dclass the entertainment system had quite a wide variety of both movies and music there was only one wc for a cabin of 50 passengers which is the only notable demerit that i found price was acceptable for a lastminute trip purchased six hours before departure the online purchasing was simple and efficient
22979,xiamen airlines,5,most of the crew were pleasant,flew hangzhou to singapore with xiamen airlines for a chinese airline i was rather pleased that the plane departed on time most of the crew were pleasant but one or two stewardess did not have a smile on their faces food was served and was pleasant enough we were also given a packet of nuts and a bottle of water 23 into our flight i wouldnt mind taking this flight again although there was one issue that perplexed me apparently ipads laptops tablets could be used during the flight but mobile phones were not allowed i honestly think this is rather stupid since a mobile phone works just like an ipadtablet the inflight entertainment is but a pathetic small tv that one can barely see what is being shown and only chinese movies were played
9564,firefly,5,firefly customer review,szb lankawi return and szb penang return subang airport is peaceful quiet efficient and close to kuala lumpur check in swift and boarding seamless as seat numbers assigned and the planes are small fokker 50s the flights were very comfortable former mas seating not budget with friendly flight attendants proper assignation of seat numbers makes such a difference compared to the shambolic scrum at lcc terminal i hope they expand and operate many more routes from szb
14145,lufthansa,5,pay for food in a premium airline,tried for the first time the pay for food option on this airline which claims to be a premium airline basically the same experience as on a low cost with the difference it takes ages to have processed finding the ordered products and payment what you want to consume clearly cabin crew is still not accustomed with the concept still not getting used to having to pay for food in a premium airline
4045,allegiant air,1,terrible experience,ill preface this by saying the crew was fantastic unfortunately thats the only positive first they charge 50 bucks for carry on i got that free on the flight to austin with alaska then a gate agent called too many zones at once and it turned into a big mess onboard it was cramped and the seats are just metal with fabric my back is feeling it today and there is no wifi nor even a tiny snack or cup of water available even water is pay only terrible experience shouldnt exist as an airline
3321,airasia india,2,arrival was not on time,guwahati to delhi the flight arrival was not on time they said there are weather issues as reason for delay which there was not normal weather outside at time of landing booked cabs missed reached home late was veryhungry and tired i requested a window seat but they denied that as well
4610,asiana airlines,6,good amount of space,tokyo to seoul comfortable seat and good amount of space however needed to ask for drink before take off and was told that the champagne was frozen so that we could not have any got some eventually korean menu was good quality bimibap but wine selection was atrocious fas seemed to disappear and not very attentive was okay as a short 25 hour flight but expected better
1221,air canada,4,inside the airport was a complete screwup,i didnt mind flying air canada we went from kamloops to toronto to cancun the problem was that you have to buy everything you dont get anything free except for a drink water or juice or pop which is fine but four hours from kamloops to vancouver and buy a bag of peanuts for six dollars is not acceptable then we flew from toronto to cancun but we didnt get a chance to buy anything much in toronto because we arrived at 530 am and there was nothing really open we had a really bad experience in toronto on the way back no air canada representatives would help us we just got sent in circles continually my friend was trying to put her vanilla for a checked bag but all they did was make us go through security three times send us upstairs downstairs and when they did we had nowhere to go to check her bag we almost missed our flight but by the grace of god we caught it and air canada held the flight only because there was a maintenance issue no signage nobody to help nobody directing us nobody guiding us nobody taking us to where we needed to go to check the bag there is only two lovely ladies that helped us and nobody else did nobody was at the customer service desk downstairs some lady was standing there for 15 minutes waiting for somebody and nobody was there me and my friend would like to be compensated for the hour running we had to do going up and down three times through security through the gates back through security back through the gates and for her loss of her 50 in american dollars there needs to be better service i appreciate all the flight attendants all the people at the gates all the people that helped because they did their job but when we got to the airport inside the airport was a complete screwup
12140,jet2com,3,what a waste of time,east midlands to alicante we thought we would give them a try as never flown with them before what a waste of time everyone checked in at the airport in alicante waiting for a flight and announce 1 and half hour delay why no explanation too late to go out of airport now just stuck here
14174,lufthansa,3,seating is well below industry standard,business class seating is well below industry standard finding yourself with feetlegs essentially on your neighbor wifi doesnt work overcrowded lounge in mia left baggage in frankfurt and would only deliver them next day even if they arrive on a flight 2h later
4333,american eagle,8,was good value for money,short american eagle flight from washington ronald regan to chicago ohare it wasnt perfect the boarding gates were hidden downstairs we were transported to the bus via bus which was waiting definitely too long from the other hand the plane was small so it surely wasnt priority crew was okay nonalcoholic drinks were served comfort was acceptable for the price i paid 70usd it was good value for money
9382,fiji airways,6,lot better than i expected,sydney to nadi in fiji airways business class only problem i had is that i booked qantas ticket qf391 paid qantas and as a gold air berlin sapphire oneworld i tried to get into the qantas lounge i could but i could not take my partner as they would not except my air berlin as i was not travelling on qantas aircraft the lady at qantas lounge even said that i do not earn status credit or miles flying fiji airways i had to correct her and show her the qantas ff page very sad that qantas lounge staff dont know about their own loyalty program i was very concerned about my upcoming flight on fiji airways due to bad reviews i found the airline fine not fancy but they are trying and seams from previous reviews that it is improving slowly boarding was easy business was before children they way it should be the crew were friendly warm welcome at the door and nice pre departure cocktail when i purchased the ticket on qantas web page it was for the airbus but when i arrived at the gate i noticed it was the boeing 737 big difference in product but seat was still comfortable cocktails were served about 50min after take off a nice range of red and white wines and spirits lunch was a nice spicy chicken vegetable and rice it was very spicy and for the first time i have eaten the entire meal on a plane of course i had another scotch the flight attendants were very attentive coming around refilling drinks until 30 min before landing overall not a bad flight a lot better than i expected and i would do it again would like to try the airbus product
17087,royal jordanian airlines,2,one of my worst airline experiences,return trip from london to kuwait turned into a complete farce connecting flight in amman was cancelled and new flight was announced as 24 hours later about 2 hour wait at the airport followed by another 34 hour wait at the amman airport hotel a 2 star facility at best in the middle of the night to get a room key for room arranged by airline complete chaos at the hotel with no airline representative present and the airline had also forgotten to provide vouchers before shipping passengers from 3 different cancelled flights to the hotel airline also stamped a very restrictive transit visa on everyones passport which forbade leaving the hotel or getting a different hotel on own expense i qualified for a tourist visa on arrival but was not informed i would have gladly paid for my own accommodation in a different hotel but was informed that i couldnt leave i was literally in a jail room was a shambles with no towels dirty floors broken furniture other flights cancelled too with families with children in poor state with not even water offered to them one of my worst airline experiences in 40 years of air travel and my first and last time on this airline im an emerald highest tier member on one world and booked on rj as theyre a one world airline does one world have any basic standards of membership seems not my sincere advice to everyone is to avoid this airline flight cancellations do occur but airlines dont abandon and disrespect their passengers like this airline did
8864,ethiopian airlines,1,claimed my visa was not valid,i was denied boarding by a gate agent in cotonou the agent could not read english and claimed my visa was not valid checkin staff later admitted that it was valid after i had been denied boarding and had missed my flight ground staff was unwilling to help and issue a new ticket the call centre ethiopian airlines is thoroughly unhelpful as well they either keep you waiting for hours or claim there is nothing they can do
8215,eastern airways,3,eastern airways customer review,punctual generally reliable and a good selection of routes around the uk fares are extortionate planes very uncomfortable and noisy cabin staff tend to be rude and abrupt they need to remember we are paying customers and deserve a little courtesy not just being barked at in a bad tempered way a bit of customer service training wouldnt go a miss
1873,air india,1,never flying air india again,probably the worst airline i flew from the milan airport to new delhi the aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets we noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door our seats were broken as the recliner didnt work in addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didnt work we spent 8 hours staring at air india logo on the screen the croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible on a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional never flying air india again
3976,alitalia,9,a very comfortable way to fly,alitalias premium economy is a very comfortable way to fly on our recent trip from amsterdam to cape town we booked premium economy and good to know unlike others alitalia will put you in business class on connecting flights that dont have premium economy a huge step up from many of the other airlines that will seat you in economy so those flights come with complimentary lounge access lounge in amsterdam provided by klm which is just ok business class on board alitalia is pretty standard but seats do have adjustable armrest that create a slightly wider seat ample pitch and a little table in between seats that folds down i was quite impressed with the catering a traditional set up with a good pasta salad and dessert service was fine connection in rome is really easy as you are leaving the eu no security our flight to joburg left on time with an early arrival this is important because if the flight is late it will be handled at a remote stand which easily adds 30 minutes to getting through the arrival process alitalias premium economy is wonderful really comfy seats with great recline quite adequate for sleeping avoid the first row because leg space is really reduced there seats are in a 232 arrangement with 2 rows on the side and 3 in the middle second window row is really the best a nice amenity kit was handed out pre departure bubbles in plastic cups meal service was upgraded and somewhere in between economy and business class proper linens china and silverware were used i had a great sleep on this flight breakfast was very basic service from the staff could be warmer but nothing to get upset about arrival in joburg was okay with a short wait at immigration alitalia sells a connection to cape town which we took on saa but they dont partner which means if anything happens that will make you miss your connection they will point fingers to each other we made our connection but trying to make some sort of a change in the trip was impossible because of this
16644,ravn alaska,6,delayed with no explanation,anchorage to homer last 4 times i have flown with ravn alaska my flights been delayed with no explanation given at any point starting to think maybe ravn alaska just doesnt know how fast their planes go other than that i have no issues but waiting an extra hour or more every time i fly is getting old
2876,air seychelles,6,air seychelles customer review,cdgsezcdg overall average airline that left me with mixed feelings outward flight delayed by 2 hours due to technical failure with chaotic or no information given af staff and aeroport de paris are responsible inward flight was on time smily and efficient crew on outward flight versus grumpy and unfriendly crew on inward flight on both flights business class seats show their age and very old concept no lie flat no electrical control ife is a joke not on demand personal screens show only two channels but crew can provide on request some dvd like personal readers with a limited choice 5 movies that are on demand aircraft are old but food choice of international and creole and wines 1 champagne 2 red and 2 white wines were good with a nice service of cheese and desserts unfortunately absolutely no service between meals on inward day flight beverages had to be negotiated with crew in the galley lounges good but af at cdg to sum up decent aircraft with modern cabins are needed and some cabin crew need to improve their attitude
3459,airasia x,1,charge extra for everything,gold coast to kuala lumpur no inflight entertainment seats are rock hard and sit too upright absolutely freezing so make sure you bring a coat as they charge you for a blanket they entice you into a flight with great prices to realise they charge extra for everything a full service airline give you as standard
3947,alitalia,5,very different flight experiences,bari to london via rome and had 2 very different flight experiences i booked my flights several months ahead of travel for my summer holiday and found the alitalia site to be very efficient and user friendly alitalia emailed me a reminder to checkin online and so that side of things proved to be impressive and reliable checkin at bari was quick and the gentleman who checked me in made pleasant small talk and was very polite the flight from bari to rome was on an a320 the aircraft was clean and the interior well presented boarding was well managed and the flight departed slightly early and reached rome 10 mins ahead of schedule during this short flight the friendly and well turned out crew served drinks and were a great credit to their company disembarkation was most efficient and orderly i transferred from the domestic terminal to terminal e for the flight to london this flight was on a clearly older a320 boarding was not orderly as too many passengers had far too much hand luggage the flight was delayed for over 90 minutes on the runway and no announcements were made by the captain at all most of the cabin crew disappeared and left one lady to try and answer questions from worried passengers one passenger was told that storms over london had caused the delay and another person said there was power failure at heathrow this was all hearsay and not at all beneficial to passengers i noted how a captain from another airline was treated like a king by the cabin crew he was placed by the emergency seat and another passenger moved to enable this two mexican ladies sat next to me and were concerned about missing their flight to mexico city the same cabin crew member who fussed over the captain waved her hands at the mexicans and said it was not her job to know about connecting flights during this flight a small drink was served and a snack consisting of a micro packet of biscuits when i arrived at heathrow i found that my case had been broken i had to find a place to report this and was assisted by a young man who was clearly not coping well apparently quite a few bags on the flight did not even arrive in london i shall hesitate to use alitalia for international flights but should i need a domestic flight i shall consider them the poor communication was a great concern and the indifferent staff on the rome to london flight were a cause for concern
4174,american airlines,2,will never fly american again,first off i paid for a first class ticket a lot of money i fly monthly and i always fly first class when i got to the airport i went to scan my eticket which clearly showed i have a first class seat the machine said i was too late to check luggage it didnt make sense i was 2 hours early a very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage and i got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority when i went to check in at the gate i was told to step aside a female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass so she asked a male agent to assist me he was extremely mean and rude he said i wasnt on the flight i showed him my confirmation email my eticket that showed my seat number and he said it didnt matter i dont exist in in the system he then assigned me a new seat in economy i told him i paid for a first class ticket he said you didnt tell me that ask for a refund had he actually looked at my ticket he wouldve seen that i was first class i didnt want to make scene so i moved on when i passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty i do not know if it filled after but i was one of the last ones on the plane i imagine it went empty i probably should have just showed my e ticket and i could have sat down but honestly i was so taken back by the way i was just treated i wasnt thinking i have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how i can get a refund of the difference i fly first class because i fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings i spend a lot of my hard earned money i was treated horribly by the agent at the gate i do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business i can tell you i will absolutely never fly american airlines ever again and i will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip i dont appreciate being treated so badly there was no cause for him to be this way other than he enjoyed pushing his weight around so american airlines you lost a customer
20793,transaero airlines,3,transaero airlines customer review,night dmekjadme 5hourflight got a web checkin with the boarding pass sent to the mobile however still had to rush about the airport looking to print out the paper pass as there were no electronic boarding pass procedure at the airport not even a way to print it out quickly at the checkin kiosks after the registration was closed was registered 10 hours before the flight inflight service was slow and poorly organized it would make more sense on a night flight to start and finish the flight service during the first part of the flight to let people rest rather than drag it out through the whole flight seat comfort was close to nothing literally no leg room i am 180 cm511 its a shame to pay normal price for a lowcost service
19635,tag airlines,6,decent flight of 115 hour,cancun to guatemala decent flight of 115 hour nothing special all went well except for a delay of 4 hours flight attendant was friendly
15273,norwegian,3,a cheap flight i suppose its great,miami to london gatwick first time flying with norwegian i was very unimpressed how they weigh your carry ons i had a small pull along suitcase full of my babies essentials for the flight and was told it was too heavy and i would have to pay 15 a kilo my suitcase was over by 3 kilos also and the lady serving us just grunted pointed to the left and shouted go go come back when you sort the flight was ok the seats were comfy the tv was actually pretty snazzy and cool but on a long haul flight i was shocked that food is not included free this is a company that does not strive for positive customer feedback they offer cheap flights and its a take it or leave it scenario if you need a cheap flight i suppose its great however if your looking to start your holiday off cheery and happy i suggest flying with someone else
7817,csa czech airlines,2,maximum occupancy and minimum legroom,boarding process borderline rude with boarding announcement focused around the warning that carryons will be checked for size and weight boarding personnel obviously trained to police and enforce rather than to serve this is now part and parcel of the standard csa travel experience since they began luring leisure travellers on rockbottom fares with steep surcharges for checkedin baggage to what used to be business clientelle flights with decent levels of service for highprice flexible tickets early morning to western europe late evening back without warning the flight was not operated by their own a319 providing decent seating comfort instead they used their parent companys b737 configured for maximum occupancy and minimum legroom with my 5 11 182 cm i had a choice between sitting with my legs spread apart or massaging the bottom of the passenger before me with my knees btw their parent company is the lowcost travel servicesmartwings a czech and chineseowned business and one of only two carriers in europe with twostar rating from skytrax avoid if you can
5669,blue air,1,has very bad services,bucharest to paris blue air is a low cost company which has very bad services online checkin boarding baggage attendants flight attendants etc i do not recommend this company and i will never use again
2605,air niugini,3,seat pitch is ridiculously tight,sydney to port moresby air niugini use a remote hard stand for boarding in sydney passengers can expect to catch a bus to take them to the aeroplane economy class seat 12b the seat pitch on the boeing 737700 is ridiculously tight and is much much less than their 767s which i fly very often i use qantas 737800s every 12 weeks and they offer a much better seat pitch i am 189cm and my knees were jammed against the seat in front on the air niugini 737700 the seat cushioning and lumbar support is near nonexistent and passengers should expect to have back and leg pain on arrival the 767 is the same the seats fail to lock up right and recline on takeoff my seat gradually reclined to the full reclined position on its on which severely impacts the limited space for the person seated behind you the ife on their boeing fleet 767 and 737 has issues the touchscreens rarely work and register phantom touches consistently throughout the flight these either sequence the exit movie button or turn the volume to max the passenger in the seat next to me screens orientation was upside down the food is relatively good for an economy flight general condition of the aeroplanes are showing their age
21063,tuifly,4,tuifly customer review,berlin txl to cairo and back for the low price service was good seat pitch acceptable the meals came in a cheap paper box but were quite tasty plenty of rounds with free non alcoholic drinks newspapers pillows and blankets and comfy leather seats toilets were a little bit old and smelly but not dirty the flight attendants were efficient but not so very patient with some of the non german passengers i had the impression that they were not used to communicate with a multi national mix of passengers and got easily annoyed to explain things twice however these were excellent flights at a very reasonable price
6884,china airlines,6,lounges are notoriously bleak,san francisco to bangkok via taipei the seats on their 777300 and a350 are excellent wide and full lieflat and decent blanket the seats are sturdy so you cant feel movement by other passengers in neighboring seats getting up and down amenities are decent and the cabin staff is attentive overall though this is at best a middling businessclass product unlike other airlines you dont get champagne before departure just a choice of apple juice orange juice or water inflight entertainment options are quite limited with many movies and tv shows available only in chinese the food tends to be merely edible and seldom appetizing or enjoyable its beyond me why they charge business class passengers for wifi theres nothing like paying upwards of 5000 for a single ticket trying to log on to wifi and finding that you need to pay extra for wifi access as for ground service china airlines lounges are notoriously bleak theyre often quite crowded and the food and beverage choices are ridiculously limited in taipei for example they have 45 dim sum varieties on offer some congee and a couple of other chinese offerings such as a cabbage stirfry dish at the sfo lounge the choices are vastly more limited youll get far better food outside in the terminal the functionality of the china airlines website is primitive at best i have yet to find out how to pull up my itinerary without trying to check in
19715,tam airlines,7,tam airlines customer review,im a lufthansa frequent flyer on the sao paulofrankfurt route but this time i decided to give tam a try equipment was a boeing 773 seat factor something between 95 and 100 mainly brazilians onboard was pretty much impressed with the large quantity of movies and films available on the ife cabin crew friendly did speak good english but i do agree with some previous reviews too much talking and gossiping among them food quality was in my opinion better than lufthansa but what a small portion i got for dinner good breakfast but no tea available i found the seat more comfortable than lh did especially appreciate the footrest each seat has a small amenity kit was also a nice touch at the end i have to say i was satisfied but lufthansa will still be my first choice
9839,flynas,3,the food on this airline is the absolute worst,the food on this airline is the absolute worst i purchased a sandwich and it was cream cheese on a dry spongy flat hotdog roll i wouldnt feed an animal the staff are sour the plane has never left on time and i have flown them 8 times they also falsely advertise their holiday destinations for sarajevo they have a photo of mostar expensive for the level they are

21333,united airlines,2,customer service noticeably bad,united is the worst airline i am super positive person and from the moment i was getting my bag tags the customer service not for myself but for others was noticeably bad imagine flying an airline like southwest its cheap you expect it to suck to an extent united is a little more expensive but not by much now the difference is the people working at united answer all your questions with a matter of fact tone to it thats the only difference uniteds seats all look like hot trash nothing is new they dont have anything special they got a 2 because they had buffalo trace whiskey nothing more
8396,edelweiss air,6,edelweiss air customer review,cape town to zurich my experience did not start very well because i could not do the online checkin so i when to the airport cpt very early for checkin ground service was very disorganized when ground staff arrived there was some people queueing but the staff ignored those people and organized the queue has people was not there confusing between passengers occurred just because the staff did not made a small effort when i got to the checkin desk the staff did not make any effort to get me a better seat as asked after spending a couple of hours waiting we board on time when i was getting in the plane my seat was changed and it was changed for a window seat that i do not like i look to my original seat and there was not even children involved in the changing no reason was gave to me if they mess up with something they should had changed me to a better seat not a worst seat confort was not good legs space was small food was just ok and entertainment was very good
9763,flydubai,4,i froze from the cold,in one week i had four flights with fly dubai bucharestmale velana airportmaldives and return in every flight i froze from the cold the ventilation was very strong and all the passengers asked the flight attendants to reduce the ventilation or make it warmer unfortunately they did absolutely nothing and we stayed with jackets and hats on our heads the food is of poor quality the coffeebetter not serve it anymore in conclusion qualityprice 4

10689,gulf air,7,we were able to change seats,i appreciate that the boarding was organized based on zones which made it very smooth and ensured everyone had enough space in the overhead compartments it was not a full flight so we were able to change seats and get more comfortable spots the first supper meal was just sandwiches which i skipped and the breakfast was pretty good with an omelette and sausage the airline needs to work on the infotainment the highlight is the reasonably priced falcon wifi which was very efficient and helped me stay in touch with my friends and family back home
2716,air serbia,2,delayed flights lost luggage,delayed flights lost luggage and when they located it they said i would have to go back to the airport to pick it up they dont even send it never again

2679,air nostrum,5,air nostrum customer review,madtoumad on crj 900 the flight attendants provided a very good service even though the flight only lasted 50 minutes they did their very best on this time the only bad thing was the announcements the flight attendant who was in charge didnt spoke french maybe in flights that go to france they should speak a bit of french
14990,nepal airlines,8,service was okay,bangalore to kathmandu the ground staff was not friendly but inflight the crew and service was okay the food and the drink was excellent with the good cabin crew hospitality there was no entertainment for the 3 hours flight i didnt like the attitude of the ground service
466,aerolineas argentinas,3,business class seats old,rosario to barcelona via buenos aires with aerolineas argentinas horrible airplane no plug in for the laptop unacceptable in business class food was horrible awful croissant and roll not eatable business class seats old not possible to lay flat completely it was possible to sleep therefore with this respect ok no airshow it was frozen after 30 minutes flight and it wasnt reset even after flight attendants were notified no chance to know where we are
9984,flysafair,1,staff on board was rude,first of all the front desk ladies were very sweet and helpful i can not complain about them now lets start the staff on board were rude and did not seem bothered with the clients at all after the safety instructions were done they simply went and buckled themselves in not one of them came by and checked to see if any of the passengers were buckled in when we arrived my sons car seat was booked in as special baggage well thank you for breaking the chair into two pieces the car seat was thrown on the floor in the middle of the conveyors where you collect your bags we asked the people at the kiosk where we should collect the special baggage they simply pointed to stuff thrown on the floor and there was where my sons car seat was thrown when we flew with mango on the 4th they brought my sons car seat to us to the kiosk on a trolley as it should be but to throw someones baggage like it garbage is disgusting staff have no personality no drive and no respect for your clients goods when we flew with mango again on the 4th of feb the pilots were excellent they kept telling us and informing us where we were but the pilots of flysafair did none of that i regret not flying with mango again and regret that i used your services i will never be you client again and i advise anyone not to make use of your services
16559,qatar airways,5,my seat was uncomfortable,the aircraft was very old the screen tv was blurred and not working and my seat was uncomfortable no wifi unfortunately the cabin crew were nice respectful and helpful
18519,smartlynx airlines,7,low end budget fashion,operated on behalf of easyjet bit of a mixed bag over an hour late staff appeared a little disinterested but were just about polite but spent most of the flight behind the curtain at the front no welcome or comms from the flight deck at anytime during the flight plane was tired all a bit retro but smooth ride and got us home if in rather obvious low end budget fashion
17381,s7 siberia airlines,8,comfortable time of departure,yekaterinburg to moscow domodedovo the main advantages for me comfortable time of departure at 610 from yekaterinburg 640 arrival in domodedovo punctuality and flexible prices i dont need luggage so i appreciate that i dont have to pay for it however i buy priority seats usually they are free at that time so i get the whole row for myself the flight lasts less than 2 hours but s7 provides food sandwiches with chicken or vegetables and new press unfortunately they have the flight back too early in the evening so i have to choose other airlines what becomes a pity every time because in the qualityprice ratio of s7 seem to be one of the best in the market
19991,thai airasia,2,last 2 flights have not been on time,bangkok don muang to chiang mai flight booking for 940 instead they changed my flight to 1020 and from cnx to dmk from 1545 again they changed to 1645 these are not the first time because last year i bought 5 flights for this year with them and so far the last 2 flights that i flew with them have not been on time as well being a budget airline does not mean you can ignore being on time
7040,china southern airlines,9,seats on the plane are very comfortable,although their flights decreased a lot due to the epidemic it had no impact on their quality service maybe there are fewer flights and fewer people at the airport but the staff at the checkin counter are more careful than before boarding is also very smooth the seats on the plane are very comfortable the greetings from the flight attendants make me feel great
5548,belavia,6,working to improve its position,amsterdam to minsk return with belavia a renewed fleet and improved service seems to be the goal but for now beware of the inconsistencies as of 2017 belavia serves hot meals on all flights more than 15 hours on flight to minsk meal of chicken veggies and bulgur was healthy and good on return flight not the case at all 95 potatoes with congealed cheese and bacon with a dry muffin so cross fingers and hope for the best aircraft are very old or very new seat comfort varies quite a bit however both flights were on time and staff efficient if a bit duteous though as another reviewer has stated the standard working presumption seems to be that everyone speaks russian online checkin didnt work for unknown reason but kiosk checkin at amsterdam and minsk was easy and allowed plenty of seat options busboarding in minsk is annoying given what appear to be empty airbridges but it is what it is in short belavia is working to improve its position and image but inconsistency in execution remains however they seem to be on the right track which is more than can be said for some of the other flagship carriers in europe interesting to see where belavia goes with the new 5day visafree entry in belarus which is hassleless
4703,atlantic airways,9,very pleasant,copenhagen to vagar faroe islands and the atlantic airways a319 was still quite new and had the feature of mood lighting which you dont see on many european short haul aircraft the cabin layout was very nice the food was simple but good a nice little wrap salad with fresh salmon bread and little minirittersport chocolate very surprised that only 45 minutes after the meals drinks service they did a second drink service a full aircraft on a 205hr flight the service was friendly and the lady who served me was most charming a simple short haul flight but very pleasant
5534,belavia,8,this flight was rather nice,moscow domodedovo to minsk my previous experience with this airline was quite negative but this time there were almost nothing critical to complain on the procedure of online booking and check in was smooth and quick recently belavia introduced lowcost tariffs without checked baggage etc which allowed to make prices more reasonable ground procedures in domodedovo were rather slow but this is not an airlines fail onboard experience was great i was lucky to get modern aircraft because belavia still operates some ancient boeing 737 classic but this time it was a new b738 instead cabin crew were awesome there was even a meal service hamcheese sandwiches despite the flight is just 1h long what was rather disappointing bussing to terminal instead of jet bridge both in dme and msq maybe they have a reason for this but in both airports i saw a lot of vacant jet bridges also cabin was very cramped like in lowcost carriers possibly they are managing to cut costs in such a way i criticize belavia often for cosmic prices on european destinations for old aircraft for monopoly on flying to msq from several destinations especially european for sovietstyle of management that one can face sometimes but this particular flight was rather nice
17928,shenzhen airlines,8,the flight was a bargain,london to hanoi via shenzhen boarding was a little prolonged and we were called to the gate much earlier than needed on the london shenzhen leg both of my flights left slightly late the crew were friendly seat was comfortable and food was surprisingly good considering we had two full meals and drinks on the first leg and a snack box on the second the entertainment on the london shenzhen leg had enough options to satisfy me though far fewer than other airlines the system was modern and worked well the shenzhen hanoi leg had no entertainment crew announcements were hard to hear and very brief in english transiting in shenzhen was as chaotic as expected but took around an hour in total i had to follow signs to domestic transfers wait in a holding area to fill in some forms through immigration then headed upstairs to departures of my own volition my checked bag went all the way without having to collect in shenzhen the flight was a bargain and i definitely would use again
16103,play,2,passive aggressive and sarcastic,bought 2 tickets one person couldnt make it so i changed the name of the passenger for 190 the second passenger couldnt make it for the same ticket so the ticket was cancelled play kept the ticket fare for the cancelled ticket however refused to refund the name change fee for a ticket nobody used when complained they stated this is their terms and conditions refused to give rationale for their costs and the person dealing with it was passive aggressive and sarcastic when you insure your tickets read the small print there arent many circumstances when youll get your money back
11148,iberia,5,id recommend not purchasing anything extra,flight was fine made good time annoying captain interruptions every 30 mins unnecessarily fasten seatbelts for first 23 hrs again very little turbulence for 20 mins after takeoff that would give it 4 stars out of 5 but i paid for extra leg room and my seat wasnt saved i had a normal seat my return trip had the correct seat this happened to another women beside me as well even though i had already paid 200 approximately for the leg room they try to sell it to you again once you have your boarding pass the night before im sure theyd gladly take your money 35xs and not give you the services they dont care about you when you call they agree they messed up and they tell you to fill out a complaint form why so it can sit there in cyber space im sure theyd get right on getting your money back to you yeah right i told the lady on the phone to get lost my credit card will get it back for me id recommend not purchasing anything extra you probably wont get it
14860,monarch airlines,8,monarch airlines customer review,zb238239 3rd10th january i have flown monarch 4x times this year and have to write as they have improved immensely in the past 12 months the checkin facility at gatwick is now excellent the standard of the refurbished cabins with the new slim back seating is so much better than any comparable airline there is a real sense of space and no need to pay for extra legroom i am 6ft the foodsnack choice is more than acceptable and for the first time in a long time their crew seem to be genuinely trained in customer service whats more no delays this year i hope these new changes are here to stay
5205,ba cityflyer,5,ba cityflyer customer review,fralcy took off nearly an hour late in frankfurt due to weather flight uneventful until about 10 mins before landing had to do a missed approach due to bad fog had to divert to bhx and waited an hour for a coach to lcy arriving at 1230am when we should have arrived at 640pm very frustrating although not ba cityflyers fault its put me off using lcy as an airport due to its small size and how the weather affects it
20068,thai airways,4,service attitude lacking,no lounge access at mumbai even for business class only tg class does not provide this all other airlines provide no amenities no even a pair or socks no champagne they did offer a cheap and disgusting prosecco no food or drink menus just a verbal and mechanical choice provided service attitude lacking big time cabin condition left a lot to be desired not going to fly tg business class unless i have no other option
14853,monarch airlines,2,monarch airlines customer review,i have just returned from alicante airport with monarch i was a saga passenger in my sixties and needed a wheelchair normally we are allowed on first when there is more space and time to get seated with help i was shocked last night when we had to wait till the end and then face no baggage space and a delay being seated it was very difficult and painful as i had to wait in a queue on the plane i will have to consider not booking with monarch if this should happen again i hope this was a one off we had no problem flying out from manchester i think the lax attitude of some of the staff was the problem
17500,sata air azores,4,do not get any upgrades with them,i had to change my original flight due to a cancellation from wpb to boston on a separate airline at that point i called the main number to rebook for another date they were accommodating and helpful when we checked in our luggage they wanted to charge us for the extra that we had already paid for in advance because the attendant did no see a record of the prepaid baggage of course at that point we just paid for it again which cost us an additional 160also originally we had paid for seat upgrade 60 each 2 did not want to argue or dispute at that moment but visited the sata agency in ponta delgada to tell them what happened needless to say this was a long visit back and forth with supervisors needed to verify my ticket stubs and they wanted the actual baggage tickets to verify all of this needless to say this went on for over 1 month and they would not refund the upgrade in seats that we originally paid for and that someone else paid so sata made out with the price of these seats and if this happened to us most likely it has happened to many more people they did however refund for the extra luggage that we had already paid for moral of the story do not get any upgrades with them and make sure you get printed receipts for everything you purchasethey are not a responsible airlines and take no responsibility for their actions i fly with them as there are no other options in the azores but as soon as there are other airlines flying between islands or boston to azores they will loose a customer
17011,royal brunei airlines,4,wouldnt travel this airline again,this flight was sold to us as one stop however there were in fact 2 stops london heathrow to bandar seri begawan stopping in dubai and we later connected to bali this should have been sold as 2 stops as it is misleading to say its one and very wrong we wouldnt have bought this flight if we had known brunei bwn airport has nothing in it we had an 11 hour stop over which was torture there are no restaurants or bars in the departures lounge and the whole airport smells of urine partly due to the revolting toilets onboard the flights the evening meals were tasty choice of chicken or beef chicken lasagne stir fry ginger beef chicken chausseur beef biriyani lunch was a disgusting and sour lemon chicken wrap that repeated on you breakfast was disgusting chicken sausage or beef sausage with a vile baked egg style thing due to being an airline based in a muslim country this is a dry airline and all food is halal a 2 minute long prayer is said before each take off which is quite in your face for people that dont follow islam seats are reasonably comfy ok leg room in flight entertainment was good quite recent films the cabin crew were very attentive and polite i wouldnt travel with this airline again
23074,xl airways france,8,xl airways france customer review,i just come back from a trip to the west coast cdgsfocdg for the first time i flew on xlairways the checkin was quite good however the boarding was a little bit of a mess in paris there were mothers with babies who had not been even taken care of during the flight the kindness of the crew was quite good and its efficiency too seats would have leant a bit more you could have thought you were in business class
20502,thomson airways,6,service was not bad,flight out on thomson airways from london to jamaica was ok despite being delayed on the aircraft for an hour by a passenger who was throwing a strop because he wanted a window seat service was not bad free drink and wine with the usual standard meal unfortunately on the way back despite having paid for a seat my partner had to move due to the excessively large person sitting next to her taking up most of her seat as well as his own airlines really need to address this growing problem if you are too big to fit in one seat pay for two
23090,yangon airways,7,yangon airways customer review,rgnmdl on atr we were a bit sceptical when our travel agency booked on air yangon because we couldnt find much about this airline in skytrax the plane left twenty minutes earlier than in our tickets stated so do reconfirm the day before no hassle with luggage and weight security checks as in the whole country very relaxed but efficient comfortable seating on this short trip little snack for those who are extremely hungry friendly staff clean plane and very pleasant flight we felt safe and would fly with them again
3771,akasa air,8,cabin service is good,pleasant journey with akasa their cabin service is good and travel was on time they crew did a decent job of keeping everyone comfortable will recommend others to try
16864,royal air maroc,6,check in counter is slow in dubai,the check in counter is slow in dubai the flight was also delayed the food portions are really good although you might find the bread hard the cabin crew didnt answer call bells they would turn it off cleverly while passing by
359,aeroflot russian airlines,6,leg room was very good,barnaul to vienna via moscow it was the first routing on aeroflot for me in many years and i was keen to see if and how their product has changed over time i had flown the route viesvobax a week before as well all sectors were operated by boeing 737800 aircraft and the planes seemed to be in very good condition from outside and in the cabin leg room was very good for economy class the flight attendants were helpful and service was done in a professional manner on the flight from moscow to vienna several passengers who were influenced by alcohol already when they boarded became a nuisance to all others they disturbed other guests and started to threaten their neighbours after landing in vienna the crew did not react to this and even sold alcohol to them this event had a negative impact to my personal feeling of safety
5784,blue panorama airlines,4,cabin crew friendly and professional,mxphav return in y class boeing 763er was in good condition and quite confortable i chose for poltronissima air that indicates the possibility to be assigned a seat in the emergency exit row larger than others by paying 50 at checkin desk and overall was pretty good allowing me to stretch my legs cabin crew friendly and professional passing around with water trolleys through all the flight both flights arrived at destination before the time scheduled
11247,iberia express,7,a nice experience,stuttgart to las palmas via madrid before the flight i needed to contact their hotline the german hotline is a total disaster even after having tries it for more than 20 times it was impossible to reach someone you are redirected from one announcement to another and at the end you get kicked out unacceptable and unprofessional finally i called iberia in spain and to my surprise not only did i reach someone just after three attempts my problem was solve immediately by a friendly and competent employee due to the bad experience with the german hotline we had very limited expectations regarding the flights but to our surprise again all flights were quite enjoyable nice staff good food decent space and all flights were on time it is not a real business class but very good value for money overall a nice experience and nothing to complain about but iberia badly needs to improve their german service hotline
21009,tui airways,9,a really good airline,departure airport firstly an overview of the airport we were checked in for our flight so quickly as we were called to an empty lane at cmf their queues work differently there the staff were chatty and friendly you are advised to go through security once called as there is not much on the other side the queue was a bit long but we got moving within half an hour after boarding we had 20 minutes to relax until pushback the flight took off and it was only five minutes late rare that a tui flight i go on is on time the cabin service soon followed but the rear trolley had to return to the galley as we had a lot of turbulence for the first half an hour we descended and that turbulence went the back trolley was back in service and we ordered our food unfortunately they only had a bacon baguette or a ham and cheese toastie in small numbers luckily we were able to get two bacon baguettes they were yummy but a bit expensive after that there were final checks for the descent into manchester we were served well by the crew arrival airport we landed nice and punctual but a little bottleneck happened as it said all bags will be delivered before 1450 well a little lie there as i only had one of my three bags by 1450 the belt stopped and started again and we finally got all our bags around half an hour later all in all a really good airline would fly again but side note they removed the seatback pockets and made this little storage area behind the tray table when you see the photo below youll understand what i mean where they put all the magazines and safety card
18471,skywest airlines,6,delayed because of mechanical issues,both times delayed because of mechanical issues very frustrating from now on direct flights only i dont understand how the same airline can have mechanical issues before take off so often
21621,v air,2,not be flying v air again,i booked a group of 11 passengers on a flight from don mueang to taipei the flight was scheduled to leave at approximately 130am for some reason the flight was delayed for well over 2 hours not much of an explanation was provided due to the flight delay our group missed their connecting flight in taipei had the flight left on time we had 4 hours to make our connecting flight with the extensive flight delay we were unable to make that connection the v air staff were not very helpful at all in trying to contact our connecting flight airline to see how we might be able to make our connection their customer service response to a request for an explanation on what happened and why more assistance wasnt provided was useless i have pasted their response below dear tim according to our policy vair has no compensation for flight delay less than 4 hours apologize for any inconvenience caused sincerely yours v bear not very helpful at all i certainly will not be flying with v air ever again in the future
22325,volaris,2,avoid at all cost,horrible flight i got a cancelled flight during thanksgiving okay thats fine i didnt get compensated but i can handle it then in february my flight got delayed by 5 hours late at night 10pm flight turns to a 230am flight how do they repay us giving us a 150 pesos 7 usd to wings a very overpriced food place food is like 210 and they charge us ridiculous overpriced food it took them one hour to even get our order 30 minutes to give us the food and another hour to get the check actually we were tired of waiting and when we were about to walk out is when they wanted to suddenly serve us we have to pay an extra 188 pesos because the food is way more than the 150 voucher after that horrible restaurant experience we are still waiting for our flight avoid at all cost
5155,ba cityflyer,6,could be a quality carrier,london city to granada ba cityflyer still feels like it could be a quality carrier worth paying for if only details were paid closer attention to london city is a delight to fly through even though it was a bit overcrowded and the fact checkin staff were directly employed by ba really paid off as they were warm welcoming and friendly e190 is a pleasure to fly the legroom is fantastic and the 22 seating is fantastic for couples travelling as we were the inclusion of complimentary food and drinks with a full bar service that includes alcohol and quality fever tree tonic is appreciated quickly off in small but perfectly formed and clean granada was also a nice end to the flight with luggage out immediately unfortunately these positives are really cut with some quite prominent negatives that are very noticeable the plane was not clean secondly the crew some of these really shouldnt be working in a customer facing environment lastly the food while complimentary is of poor quality
4925,avelo airlines,6,you get what you pay for,you do not get refreshments and inflight amenities youre getting what you pay for affordable transportation avelo flies to and from small regional airports that arent serviced or are under serviced by larger carriers and do not have daily service checkin was easy on the website i did elect to pay for seat selection and the 14 was worth have a row to myself the incoming flight from new haven was late so boarding was delayed but the flight itself was not quick turnaround time by the staff the plane is an older 737 the planes do have different cabin configurations this one had the smaller and harder seats still better than spirit but a similar quality took off without issue the flight itself was uneventful unfortunately the weather in ct did not agree with this it was incredibly windy with a pretty severe amount of turbulence we had two missed approached and held over the lis for about an hour the pilots informed us what was going on after the second attempt when we entered the holding pattern unfortunately that was not a particularly fun hour with the turbulence over the water i fly often and am not a particularly nervuous flier but i was not comfortable be advised at new haven we had airstairs and had to walk off the ramp and i did not check luggage but luggage claim at tweed if outside traffic at tweed was horrendous and the airport itself needs to address that if theyre going to have commercial flights you get what you pay for extremely economic transportation in and out of rarely serviced airports would fly again
9543,firefly,9,firefly customer review,singapore to ipoh using firefly its good value for money despite the airline having a monopoly on this route i was impressed with the web checkin facility and the direct debit facility that is now available and makes booking a ticket convenient the stewardesses onboard were professional
2656,air nostrum,8,cabin staff very kind,flew air nostrum from melilla to madrid was a business flexible ticket quality price excellent ground service in melilla is nothing special for business flyers just a different row for checkin the seat comfort for a short flight less than 2 hours was ok even though for a business class you could expect more breakfast is served for free for business class giving two or three menus i had fruit and it was very well served with yoghurt cheese the quality was excelent i asked for kosher food and this wasnt given they said they do not have kosher menu but suddenly on my way back they brought me kosher food no entertainment on board bathroom without hand towel cabin staff very kind
8924,etihad airways,5,the flight was pleasant,the flight was awesome and amazing crew should improve their behavior little bit we loved the flight meal was also average tv was also big enough and the flight was pleasant
19348,sunwing airlines,4,sunwing doesnt much care for you,last minute notification that instead of 8am ottawa direct departure departure it would be 1230 early afternoon and then stopping in toronto first this meant a total day of travel arriving at destination 10 pm this is most times the case and shameful that sunwing doesnt advise you of this calling sunwing is the worst they have no idea how to communicate and treat you as stupid systems are always down and please call again another time they rate a 1 out of ten for every call made to customer service the only pleasant people at sunwing are the booking agents use another all inclusive if you can sunwing doesnt much care for you after they have your money
21115,tunisair,5,tunisair customer review,very bad service frequent delays very unfriendly hostesses definitely not worth the money but forced to fly with them because there are no other companies offering the same trajectory bcntun
21130,tunisair,8,tunisair customer review,mxptun mirfco check in easy on both routes there are crew to greet you at the door but they do not smile crew service good but will assume you speak arabic meal on outbound flight was delicious meal on rome sector was cold and disgusting but only an hour flight both flights on time and even early into tunis
19605,taag angola airlines,8,pleasantly surprised with taag,i was pleasantly surprised with taag flying return from cape town to lisbon via luanda the aircraft was clean the meals very good though the presentation and accompaniments were on the cheap side seats were comfortable and the 3x3x3 seating feeling much more spacious than the 3x4x3 found many airlines 777s ground staff in cape town were pleasant and the crew pleasant throughout luanda airport could be vastly improved by offering clean toilets otherwise it is ok luanda airport also has a boneyard of abandoned aircraft some interesting specimens while only using the flight tracking on the in flight entertainment it seemed to have a selection of films and shows considering the price speed and great route from south africa to portugal there is no competition and i am already booked for my next flight with them
5160,ba cityflyer,8,excellent airline,due to my work i was required to travel to london however as no airline offered cheap prices on such short notice i decided to travel with ba cityflyer from rotterdam to london city traveling to rotterdam the haque airport is pretty doable by public transport from rotterdam central station or the hague central station by bus andor underground once arrived i went straight to checkin my luggage which was fast and efficient as there was literally no queuing time after passing the usual struggle at security i had a hour left before boarding starts due to work in progress on rotterdams terminal there wasnt much to do wifi was fast and constant though with lots of seating areas boarding was done in a nice and efficient way however what do you expect of only boarding approximately thirty people the cabin was comfortable plenty of legroom leather seats and a good view in front of the wing however id like to note that it would have been better if they actually replaced their magazine and safety card by a new one as the current one was in a very very poor state departed on time it was a pretty short and straight leg with the pilot informing us several times with departure arrival and weather information and 15 minutes into flight the flight attendants served us a pretty limited service for british airways terms might had to do with a short flight of only 55 minutes which included a drink of choice and a biscuit or chips once arrived with a not so smooth landing the plane was quickly parked and deboarding started within a few minutes walk to customs in peak this is terrible and baggage dropoff was just a few minutes ba cityflyer is an excellent airline providing you with plenty of legroom and friendly staff however i still found it very pricey and catering could have been improved
19909,thai airasia,8,high service level,dmkdps thai air asia has a daily direct flight between bangkok and bali at good time leave at 615 am and arrives at 1130 am so our flight is full with tourists mostly backpackers and families many of them has little to no traveling experience so starting from boarding was a challenge since many of them didnt know that we are boarding based on zones on board the fas were very polite and patient when handling these passengers and making sure they know the basic rules of flying like how to stow their luggage properly this was a full flight so it takes time to get everything taken care of and we left around 30 minutes behind schedule but we arrived only around 10 minutes late flight time is almost 4 hours so the fas have ample time to hand out preordered food and beverages we ordered two items each and they all come with drinks and the fas were so kind to hand our orders two at a time and came back to give us our second order around 15 hours before we land the fas on this flight were also wearing their masks all the time as was with other thai air asia flights but it didnt hide the genuine courtesy and kindness in their service this is a very good flight and we see that the high service level is similar throughout all thai air asia flights regardless of their flight duration or their flight time
19167,sriwijaya air,6,this new route is promising,tanjung karang to yogyakarta is actually a new route i was required to fly from bandung to yogyakarta but as an aviation geek of course i wanted to fly the longest and farthest i found that an early flight to tanjung karang from bandung is possible to be connected with sriwijaya airs flight to yogyakarta so i booked it how was my flight departure time was 1520 lt but when i arrived at 1320 lt to secure my favorite seat emergency exit window i was told that there would be a delay i was expected to fly at 1700 lt i didnt mind especially as beside me there were 150 passengers of lion air who were supposed to fly at 0800 lt to jakarta but still stranded at the airport a 1 hour 40 minutes of delay for me was fine check in went smoothly i got my favorite seat the ground crew gave me snacks for the delay compensation i boarded first the flight went okay the food was nice a cup of water and a slice of cheese bun getting my baggage was another story the conveyor belt was merged with nam airs flight from jakarta it took 35 minutes for me to grab my luggage overall this new route is promising
4315,american eagle,3,worst experience ever,ft walton to albany via washington the attitude of the person at the desk was inapproprate the airline overbooked the flight and was asking for a person to come forward and take a later flight why airlines overbook ill never know but his attitude was really nasty he said in an annoyed voice that if no one came forward it will delay the flight and everyone would miss there connecting flight sounded like a threat to me and many other people secondly to make your connecting flight you have to be bused from the plane to a waiting area and then bused back people wind up standing on the bus both ways in the waiting area etc i fortunately had check my bag at ft walton but those that did not have to get their luggage and bring it on the bus both ways what a mess will never fly american again worst experience ever and i fly quite often
3338,airasia philippines,3,need to try and up their game,hopeless airline for advance planning and reserving hotels etc twice now i have booked airasia from clark to catilclan and both times they have changed the flight dates with only one month before flying for boracay it is a requirement to have prebooked hotel accommodation so this now has to be changed assuming we can last time we had to book an extra night in caticlan as the flight date and flight time were changed why are they so useless at planning their schedules trying to book and then change hotel dates is a nightmare with air asia flights they need to sort out their schedules in advance and stop being unprofessional i know they are a budget airline but they need to try and up their game and stop behaving like one
8894,ethiopian airlines,1,refused to respond to my refund request,i booked a flight and ethiopian airlines issued a ticket after a day i heard from a friend that this airline was banned by dubai from flying passengers from uganda because they carried 9 passengers with expired covid19 results i reached out to the airline and all they had to say is we dont have flights to dubai why did they issue the tickets worst of all on the flight date 17102021 i received an email from the airline that the flight has operated a day before i received an email from their airport office that the flight will not operate and they are unresponsive they are giving different information and have refused to respond to my refund request if they cannot take me to dubai
5411,bangkok airways,4,all passengers was squeezed next to each other,flew bangkok to phuket i fly around 300000 miles a year and i have now had 2 flights with bangkok airways the service is friendly and the airplane was in good condition there was no delay during the last 3 flights complaints during online checkin the airline blocked almost all seatselections and gave you a choice of a max of 4 selections i cant tolerate such issues especially when the aircraft is 2535 booked or less all 3 flights also the ground personal would not change my seat to my desired selection with the explanation that it was not possible because we need to balance out the aircraft there were multiple empty rows and all passengers was squeezed next to each other
14369,mahan air,9,best airline in iran,tehran to dubai mahan air is the best airline in iran the business class is convenient with a variety of dishes the quality of food in this airline is great stewardess are very affable and responsible in the longterm flights the amenity kit will be given to you generally the flight will be satisfied
7293,cobalt,6,greek language is a must,larnaca to athens my first flight on this new airline based in cyprus the a320 was perfect looked clean and new departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule flight was excellent with a constant updating on the route both in greek and english all in all a great flight but flight attendants did not even speak greek and some passengers had a problem in getting service from the hostess the inflight magazine torn apart and overused was only in english even safety instructions were only in english this airline seems to ignore or avoid the greek language being a low cost airline goodies on sale were at a high price fully recommended as an airline but they should realise that greek language is a must expecially in case of emergency not to mention out of respect
22811,wow air,8,i had a good experience,after reading lots of reviews i was really sceptical about flying with wow air i still went ahead and booked my ticket to detroit as it was the cheapest option for a one way and i had to book last minute which is always more expensive i decided to pay for selected seats up the front with extra leg room on both flights and got really lucky with having no one in my row for the first flight the second flight i chose a seat with no middle seat and was really happy with this decision as its a cheap airline a lot of people do not pay for the seat upgrade its really not expensive to purchase the extra leg room and well worth it for the comfort plus you will likely not have many people around the food and drink on board is very expensive but as i knew this beforehand i purchased food and water at the airport to take on the flight with me i think i was lucky with the reliability of both my flights taking off on time as this was the one thing i was worried about the seats are very dirty front seat pocket but all airlines are usually quite unhygienic so this was to be expected the service on board i thought was great very friendly staff and attentive overall i would say you get what you pay for and you are taking a risk booking with wow air but lucky for me i had a good experience with them and would book again
5883,boutique air,1,an awful experience,cortez to denver my flight was cancelled 26 hours ago there was no customer service available at the gate as of 26 hours later no one answers their phone number or my emails nor returns any of my messages i was unable to rebook my flight take my trip or even speak with anyone and they still have my money this is an awful experience
16825,rossiya airlines,6,decent service for such a price,simferopol to moscow vnukovo was very surprised when saw aircraft type boeing 747400 while booking and actually it was which happens rather rarely for a 2h flight booking and online registration were done via aeroflot interface and were quick and efficient ground staff were a bit annoyed but not rude simferopol airport doesnt have a possibility to serve widebody aircraft near the terminal building so we had to get to the plane by bus and it took a long time the aircraft was a bit tired but nevertheless convenient also i have no complaints for the cabin staff food including a cup of waterteacoffee and a sandwich didnt look appetizing the cabin is equipped by an ancient ife system but its not working for now came to moscow in time no delays i managed to book this ticket rather cheaply 90 ow with baggage so this is a decent service level for such a price ok for short flights but i consider that travelling this airline on longhaul routes may be bothersome
8743,emirates,5,has been quite disappointing,my recent experience with them has been quite disappointing the cabin crew are less friendly than i remember them to be years back especially the male crew i experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey they felt like more of bouncers ie the men as they didnt smile werent friendly or approachable and instead of telling me this way please as i have always been used to during boarding one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction without uttering a word i found this to be a bit rude to add to this some crew members on various legs of my trip didnt offer me a beverage during snacktime while they offered my neighbours some and its not because i had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested they glanced at me and somehow decided i wouldnt be interested in a cuppa this happened three different times i will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices however i do hope to see friendlier faces in future
22902,wow air,4,seats were incredibly cramped,berlin to chicago via keflavik a pretty good airline that tries to be stylish and relatable to customers the biggest problem everyone had with this airline is that they dont provide water on the flight even if it is 7 hours long you ask for water they say you must buy a bottle for 3 euros seats were also incredibly cramped and uncomfortable there are thankfully charging ports onboard so you can use your tablet
14345,lynx air,3,it is definitely an affordable airline,it is definitely an affordable airline and i did get from point a to b but thats about it the airline was over an hour late for both my to and from flights the staff on the plane was amazing but the staff in charge of getting people onto the plane were disorganized and confusing if considering some of the lower budget options for flights i would recommend swoop or flair over this airline any day
1821,air india,2,cabin crew not arrived,we at 645 am are still waiting for the cabin crew to arrive for the flight which was supposed to board by 510 am the cabin crew not arrived yet this has caused a suffering to so many passengers all of us are stuck because of the captain and his crew members can the air india never improve
6584,cathay pacific airways,8,great value for money,the legroom was good seat was comfortable with good recline meals were tasty and inflight entertainment was exceptional the cabin crew were better than in 2019 they were pleasant helpful and efficient the 8hour flight between perth and hong kong was perfect the 15hour flight between hong kong and toronto was better than in 2019 thanks to a new a3501000 aircraft however there are still only two meal services on this very long flight which is not enough there really needs to be a third service with a proper snack box at the very least unfortunately the toilets were not well maintained if at all and the cabin crew need to clean them every hour or two particularly on such a long flight but overall i was very happy with this trip and pleased to see some improvements since 2019 it was great value for money
16610,qatar airways,4,ignored my complaint,the flight from bne to doh in november 2022 was very pleasant in qsuite and with an amazing staff and great food i was very happy the flight from doh to zrh on the other hand was on a very old plane and staff didnt seem motivated my virgin australia flight from mel to bne got cancelled and qatar did give me the choice to go without that leg or cancel the entire flight i had to organise the rebooking myself and they kept sending me emails about cancelled flights which every time i had to investigate to find out that there were no cancellations the customer service of qatar ignored my complaint and did not respond
14552,malindo air,2,worse airline ive experienced,kota kinabalu to kuala lumpur this is the worse airline ive experienced i wanted to changecancel my flight called the service centre but it seems she was no help she made matter more confusing and she gave me the wrong info but to make matter worse i got my luggage damage try to file a complain but they said i got no insurance so nothing cant be done i understand that part but i had to travel far back and forth to the lost and found department holding my heavy luggage without any offer to help me carry them
12648,jin air,5,website crashed while paying,seoul to jeju actually i had quite good experience with service and seats but three times i booked a jin air flight and two times the website crashed while paying i didnt even receive a ticket via mail but they took my money after several calls and being on hold for like 20 minutes i finally got my ticket just now it happened again and i have to call them again so thats pretty bad dont know if ill book there again but they have the cheapest flights and the staff was really friendly
10106,frontier airlines,1,garbage with a capital g,garbage with a capital g actually make it all capital letters and bolded i always want to give airlines a chance and this is my 2nd time with frontier and once again it reminded me why i shouldnt fly this airline they delayed my flight twice and claimed that my pocket on my small purse was touching their bin where they measure bags so they charged me 100 this ridiculous if you can afford a better airline or maybe save a bit more for a different airline then do it i have been so stressed out with this airline that i literally have a migraine they claim that your bag needs to be a certain measurement but what they really mean is make sure your bag slides in the bin and theres plenty of room around without even letting the slightest piece of your luggage touch the bin i hate this airline
9682,fly540com,9,fly540com customer review,i flew with fly540 from to nairobi to eldoret and back to nairobi and the service was great from the flight to the cabin crew highly recommended timing for departure and arrival to the minute
1225,air canada,3,treated rudely in security,we had a slight delay at the beginning which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control on the flight my wife became extremely sick we pressed the button to call for an attendant no one ever came to check on us when we landed we had a substantial delay which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control we were late to our connecting flight while in security the first person yelled at us for being late we were treated rudely in security we got to our gate 10 minutes before departure none of the attendants at the gate would talk to us we waited several minutes and then left to find customer service instead the customer service clerk was helpful and quickly scheduled us to the next flight to our city
21470,us airways,4,us airways customer review,the checkin process was good flight on time comfortable seats my major concern was the flight attendants we encountered out of four flights on this trip we only had one attendant that we did not overhear complain about the airline we sat in exit rows on all the flights and in seats that allowed conversation with them we specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row the attendant told us we were wrong so we made the move per request then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along the attendant apologized but didnt ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat my husband had circulation problems so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room when the beverage cart came by we did ask for a complementary rum and coke to compensate us which we did receive i would have to think twice before flying with us airways again
46,adria airways,4,adria airways customer review,wawskj economy no free snacks or drinks on this star alliance partner just full legacy carrier fares for basically a budget airline flying out of poland had no euros or usd on me i was thirsty and asked to purchase a bottle of water the stewardess said that i could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency when i pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be difficult she never offered me a tiny cup of water on the way back i switched to turkish airlines via ist and got a free 3 course meal on both segments and friendly service
644,afriqiyah airways,9,afriqiyah airways customer review,i have used afriqiyah airways for four return trips gatwick accra over the last 14 months treatment has been unfailingly good yes there have been delays but informed of the reasons for the delays and on one occasion we were given drinks while we waited to go into the airport the cabin crew are excellent and value for money is good
9251,ravn alaska,4,never be using ravn again,ravn alaska is so frustrating first off your carryon items will all pretty much have to be checked unless theyre tiny so my husband and i shortchecked our carryon bags to our next airline since the next airline we transferred to would have enough room to stow them overhead then we took this tiny 19seater plane which once boarding was finished started up the engines only to have them shut off three times before the stewardess announced something is wrong the pilots are going to try fix it thats comforting and gave out cookies to passengers to shift focus finally we were told by the pilots that there was a technical issue that could be deferred for now and once they get paperwork done then we can take off at one point early on we were told it would be about 15 more minutes then about half an hour later they said itll be about 10 more minutes until takeoff overall we were delayed in the plane sitting there prerunway for an hour and our next layover was 1 hr 20 min so when we arrived at the next airport we had literally 10 minutes until the next plane terminal would close the gate to deplane get our bags from baggage claim go through security and run to our next gate upon deplaning we asked the ground crew if we could just grab our shortchecked bags right there on the tarmac they said no we were told the baggage claim was close by which it wasnt my husband and i ran not a good idea when youre 7 months pregnant and not a runner by nature he ran to baggage claim to get our bags while i ran to our next gate to try keep the door open until my husband arrived with our bags as soon as i arrived i was told to get onboard right now and when i begged them to wait just a couple minutes for my husband who was running up as we spoke they said they could not and closed the door right in front of me thanks a lot ravn for making us shortcheck our appropriately sized carryons having technically unsound planes being untruthful about how much more time wed be delayed on the tarmac not letting us grab our shortchecked bags after deplaning and not apparently notifying the next gate that multiple passengers including us were delayed and on their way running to he gate it ruined our night and our trip home and we felt so ripped off by this airline we will certainly never be using ravn again and have let our friends know to avoid this airline as well
13179,kuwait airways,1,my ticket had been canceled,paris to manila via kuwait my story is not common but will prove the incompetence of this company in early january i wrote a message about whatsapp to the airline wanting information on the cancellation conditions because i was not sure i could honor my flight the person who answered me was very responsive told me that i had until 24 hours before my flight to cancel that i would have 200 euros penalty etc the message ended on the fact that if i wanted to cancel my ticket i had to send an email very clear on january 26th i went to the checkin counter at roissy airport to go to manila in the philippines to my surprise i learned that my ticket had been canceled due to this whatsapp conversation namely that i have not received any notification by mail or even by message of any cancellation i transferred the conversation to the ground manager who contacted them because he did not understand why such a decision especially that on the messages i had no mention of any cancellation the manager at the airport of paris cdg despite having seen that i suffered the incompetence of the company for which he works asked me to contact them of course i did not get any answer he took my file very lightly it works at the head of the customer from what i understood on the spot he had the power to press a button and resolve the situation to let me ship but he did nothing good it was that my head did not pass he told me that the staff on the other side of the phone did not find the person responsible for this error so i had a refusal to board and that the flight was complete my friend was there there were free places so i suffered the incompetence of their staff by their fault i had to buy a plane ticket one way paris manila to 570 with another company to join my friend who had to leave without me i sent emails to the company kuwait i received after 10 days a file number fr mon histoire nest pas commune mais vous prouvera de lincomptence de cette compagnie dbut janvier jai crit un message sur whatsapp la compagnie arienne voulant des renseignements sur les conditions dannulation car je ntais pas certaine de pouvoir honorer mon vol la personne qui ma rpondu a t trs ractive ma dit que javais jusqu 24h avant mon vol pour annuler que jaurais 200 euros de pnalit etc le message sest termin sur le fait que si je voulais annuler mon ticket je devais envoyer un mail trs clair le 26 janvier je me suis prsente au guichet denregistrement laroport de roissy pour me rendre manille aux philippines ma grande surprise jai appris que mon ticket avait t annul suite cette conversation whatsapp savoir que je nai reu aucune notification par mail ni mme par message dune quelconque annulation jai transfr la conversation au responsable au sol qui les a contact car il na pas compris pourquoi une telle dcision surtout que sur les messages je nai eu aucune mention dune quelconque annulation le responsable laroport de paris cdg malgr quil a vu que je subissais lincomptence de la compagnie pour laquelle il travaille ma demand de les contacter bien videmment je nai obtenu aucune rponse il a prit mon dossier trs la lgre il fonctionne la tte du client daprs ce que jai compris sur place quil avait le pouvoir dappuyer sur un bouton et de rgler la situation pour me laisser embarquer mais il na rien fait bon cest que ma tte ne passait pas il ma dit que le personnel de lautre ct du tlphone ne trouvait pas le responsable de cette erreur donc javais un refus dembarquer et que de plus le vol tait complet mon ami y tait il y avait des places de libres jai donc subit lincomptence de leur personnel par leur faute jai du racheter un billet davion aller simple paris manille a 570 avec une autre compagnie afin de rejoindre mon ami qui a du partir sans moi jai envoy des mails la compagnie kuwait jai reu aprs 10 jours un numro de dossier
2842,air seychelles,9,air seychelles customer review,in october this year i flew auhhkgauh hm86 and hm87 although slightly late leaving abu dhabi due to a catering issue the entire experience with air seychelles was brilliant although they were not particularly new a330200 aircrafts and the entertainment system a bit old and limited i found the cabin crew quite possibly the best in the business they were an energetic and enthusiastic crew working hard to give excellent customer service to passengers the flights were not full on either sector so having 2 seats to myself was great and comfortable after friendly chats about the airline with some of the crew in the galley i was brought champagne and chocolates to my seat a lovely gesture air seychelles was a stark contrast to their partner airline etihad
4787,austrian airlines,3,austrian should have done differently,a year ago i took the same flight and i was very satisfied on all accounts this year i repeated the flight and probably it was the last one with austrian my ticket states clearly meal standard as the last year what i got was a miserable half dry half wet roll of bread with some yellow cheese that half was melted inside the bag half a tomato slice and a napkin i was flying to a connection flight without food to add insult to injury at 1000 sharp when we landed all the food stands were closed at least out of consideration for those going on another flight without anything to put in the mouth austrian should have done differently
16634,qatar airways,2,seats were not comfortable,you have to watch a lot of advertising about qatar during the flight the seats were not comfortable the flight attendants were friendly but overchallenged with the service i had to wait more than half an hour to get a can of beer they wouldnt give me enough water my request for any snacks was friendly denied two times in a row i cannot recommend this airline
2301,air mauritius,7,very good experience,mauritius to beijing with air mauritius very smooth checkin immigration and security procedures at mru airport the a340 aircraft was a bit old but comfortable enough extremely good service by staff onboard and discrete meals onflight entertainment system could be improved but overall a very good experience
21520,us airways,6,us airways customer review,reasonable experience on recent flight from philiadelphia to miami oneworld emerald member so used the lounge which was actually quite good flights on time aircraft clean and crew attentive inflight meal ok cannot believe that us airways does not have inflight entertainment come on its prehistoric my other slight annoyance was that when i enquired if i could catch an earlier flight checked in very early i was told that would be 75 my flight was full but the earlier one was less fulljust appears to be cheap especially as my luggage caught the earlier flight and i thought airlines tried to avoid unaccompanied luggage
13230,la compagnie,9,great value for the price,i have flown 3 times on la companie so far and could not be happier it makes me laugh to see complaints about ground accommodations and old planes etc this is an airline that flies to a manageable airport orly with lower taxes than for example cdg it is a boutique operation with limited flights and proposes business class flights rt for as low as 1500 vs 5000 on poorer major airlines it is great value for the price and grumpy people can still spend their 1500 on a coach ticket booked on united coping with the cdg mess and see if they are offered hot towels full meal champagne and most importantly business class seats with better air quality
20628,tigerair,3,tigerair customer review,we travelled to and from chennai indiasingapore on 9th june and 16th june 2014 flight was not at all comfortable take off and landing were bumpy its accepted that flight is one of the cheapest for asia pacific region but they could at least serve a glass of water for free on a flight of 4 hours all drinks including water cost 4 s space between seats is too small to be comfortable
6363,cape air,1,take a rental car,booked the flight online with this being the last of a connecting flight no ticket able to print and no check in time listed just showed 1015am no one at the service desk upon arrival from connecting flight check back a couple of times came at 1015am and i was told we missed the flight it was sitting on the tarmac maybe give a checkin in time especially when you have no attendants its thanksgiving attendant didnt try to reach the pilot its a 68 passenger plane going to the middle of nowhere they could have stopped worst ever in 25 years of flying take a rental car
14152,lufthansa,3,the first and last time,lufthansa allows a standard hand luggage 55cm 8kg plus 1 item laptop bag no weight requirement entering the plane there was no space at all to place a hand luggage in the cabin overhead bin that was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items jackets etc i informed a flight attendant about this she apologetically told me i know but now it is difficult to fix this an attitude i respected although the problem was not fixed a bit later another flight attendant tried to help me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag then i told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit he just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg which is a cheap lie according to the official website of lufthansa and everyone has done the same here that is rudeness at a different level ive never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically 1st time flying with lufthansa though maybe thats the problem here he also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat that sounded so ridiculous all in all instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft i have never seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights ive been present to the contrary all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting i will certainly never use lufthansa again it was the first and last time i did and i would discourage anyone using this airline that does not care about customer service at all
6996,china eastern airlines,9,all the bells and whistles,flew business class between kunming and shangrila excellent 55 minute flight i had lounge access in kmg and was the sole passenger on the kmgdig flight coffee nescafe gold was quite good for inflight coffee the flight attendant kept me up to date with arrival times and pointing out interesting scenery along the way the plane itself was a brandnew b737 with all of the bells and whistles i was surprised to find it on an intraprovincial leisure route j seating is generous 22
15213,norwegian,3,often delayed at least 1h,evening flights between krk and cph are often delayed at least 1h just because the plane did not make it on time from the previous route poor logistics of the company move the landing time of the delayed flights to eg 2 am which causes sleep deprivation of the traveller and greatly increases the cost of the trip as often the only option to get home at this hour is to take a taxi
11024,hong kong airlines,4,quite low price we paid,bangkok to los angeles via hong kong first of all the hong kong airlines website is really clunky and bad the error messages are cryptic and useless at best we were not able to check in online and got different error messages each time we purchased vip lounge passes but only received 1 via emailtext and was unable to attach them to our itinerary or my frequent flier account i was unable to make an ff account for my wife again useless error messages check in lines were pretty long and boarding was poorly managed we paid extra for the extra legroom seats for the hkg to lax and return and if those have 3 extra legroom id hate to sit in a normal seat the seats were also hard and uncomfortable i have flown a number of other asian carriers singapore eva korean primarily and all had much more comfortable normal seats the food was poor and very little choice no selfserve snacks no menu provided only chinesestyle food and it just wasnt that good there was limited waterjuice service throughout the flight considering the quite low price we paid it was reasonable but if you look at other seasons the prices are not even competitive with airlines with better service i think our fare was somewhat of a fluke
5260,bahamasair,1,bahamasair customer review,my girlfriend and i flew round trip from nassau to cuba our return home was delayed for three days due to incompetence and failure to follow up on promises on the way back the flight was oversold and we were bumped off in havana there was no call for volunteers and no consideration of priority for those with connecting flights in nassau or nowhere else to go in havana according to local staff this had never happened before and they were completely unprepared to deal with it they were eventually coaxed into arranging a hotel and were great about it very embarrassed that it had happened etc it still took around five hours of messing about in the airport however we had very little cash left because we thought we were about to leave and as us credit cards dont work in cuba we were pretty much stuck and were not even able to contact the other airline that was getting us home from nassau a vp from bahamasair got involved he told us to ask for him when we got to nassau and he would sort everything out when we got there he was unavailable and neither he nor anyone else had done anything at all as a result we wasted most of the day in nassau airport then got stuck for another night in miami before finally making it home 3 days late to add insult to injury the complaint process is absurd after more than four months bahamasair eventually offered us a pittance for compensation in travel vouchers which i am unlikely to use as i will not subject myself to their appalling service again 110 rating may seem harsh as they did provide us with accommodation and limited meals for part of our delay also the people we actually dealt with facetoface were great however the utterly incompetent way they handled everything pretty much trumps any positive aspects
20845,transavia,1,i will never travel with them again,my flight was cancelled on the day before departure from copenhagen i was given no other option than getting a voucher or a refund since transavia did not have any other flights within the next 3 days now i am left with the expense of a alternative ticket and transavia which refuses to cover anything having at no time documented any of their claims transavia is an airline which cannot be trusted and i will never travel with them again advising anyone reading not to do so either
19149,sriwijaya air,5,flights are outdated,sorong to makassar this month i flew four times with this airline and and all four times we started late the delay was on average one hour the flights are outdated and the food was not good either
10445,germanwings,6,germanwings customer review,cgntxl a319 evening service after cologne carnival parade lots of passengers and even captain disguised accordingly boarding delayed due to late arrival from previous flight but crew managed to catch up departure on time arrival 10 min early crew quite neutral whereas captain made funny announcements in view of the carnival seat comfort is okay for such a short hop only buyonboard program with relatively high pricing compared to quantity of products so i opted for nothing germanwings is low cost and you practically pay for everything you want extra besides the seat germanwings has taken over complete service from lufthansa on that particular route being star alliance silverftl at lufthansa means nothing if you fly on germanwings a 100 lufthansa subsidiary some weeks ago in 2012 when lh still served the sector ftls were allowed to use the lh business lounge now they offer you lounge access for an insignificant fee of 25 what a joke
17131,royal jordanian airlines,6,food wasnt good,flew rj bkk to hkg last year and now to kul had a terrible checkin agent last time but a better lady now although quite slow boarding procedure was so annoying as monitors showed final call but the boarding hadnt even started could have spent more time in lounge i think i had the same fantastic fa last time she is really great the food wasnt good but the same chablis as last time was flowing with a big smile
609,aeromexico,5,disappointing on all fronts,disappointing on all fronts they offer online checkin but there is no bag drop line which means despite having checked in in advance i still had to wait in the same line as people that didnt even have boarding passes furthermore the check in agent informed me that my electronic boarding pass would not work so he issued me a new paper boarding pass the boarding process in yul was chaotic and disorganized i had to connect in mex and luckily i had plenty of time as there was no gate information available not on the boards in the airport not on the app not on the website the aircraft were underwhelming uncomfortable and the service subpar i wont be taking aeromexico again unless absolutely necessary
14382,mahan air,9,mahan air customer review,tehran iran to almaty kazakhstan on a relatively clean airbus a310 the flight was delayed due to airport closure in almaty nevertheless the lounge at ika was well equipped onboard the food was superb and the crew were very polite and friendly ife definitely needs improvement the inflight magazine was more like a classifieds section out of a newspaper with full pages of advertisements and not enough reading material all in all it was a very good experience
5398,bangkok airways,5,attentive crew smooth flight,siem reap to bangkok suvarnabhumi overall comfortable flight pros attentive crew smooth flight decent food you actually reach a real person if you call customer service cons flight did not leave on time web app is not easy to use when booking i wanted to book a flight from bangkok to siem reap and tried 4 times each time i got to the payment page the app would crash i finally called the customer service no on the morning of my planned departure but by that time the good airfare was gone i ended up flying with airasia which i would not recommend to anyone
6231,buddha air,6,buddha air customer review,i have flown with them three times now and they are always late sometimes due to weather and are small planes so i understand meant to fly from pokhara to kathmandu on 18th but cancelled due to storm the staff are so disorganised you have to fight through the nepalese to get to the desk chaos but flew out the next morning which was late of course staff are always lovely
18043,silkair,4,the service is satisfied,singapore to wuhan in general the service is satisfied however i cant agree that its value of money the price level of silkair is almost as its parent company singapore airline but the cabin service is too far away from what its price suggests i ordered noodle in this flight and the taste was plain the only memorable thing was they do serve icecream and the seat space was as narrow as budget airline i couldnt believe thats what a singapore airline full service subsidiary looks like
8332,easyjet,1,gave me absolutely zero alternative options,flight was delayed 25hrs there was a multiple car crash enroute to the airport so my 30min drive turned into 25hrs but i left early enough that i wasnt worried and that was for the nondelayed flight i arrived 9 minutes after checkin they wouldnt let me in and gave me absolutely zero alternative options as i frantically searched other flights i found my easyjet flight was 2 hrs delayed so again tried to get on my flight was told that apparently i missed baggage drop by half an hour this was 15hrs after the check in i had modestly missed sorry 14hr as i was 9 mins late for a flight that was 2 hrs delayed
15704,pacific airlines,5,seats very hard,this is a low cost carrier code shared with vietnam airlines who own 98 of it it used to be jetstar we paid for a full service flight with vietnam but got this instead bit of a con no inflight entertainment no service except for pay to buy seats very hard glad it was only a 2 hour flight got us there at least full flight but uneventful
8058,dragonair,5,i would not fly dragonair again,my experience with dragonair is mixed our flight from kempegowda international airport bangalore blr to hong kong international airport hkia was pleasantly good the one from hong kong to bangalore was very dysfunctional our flight was continuously postponed 9pm to 1210am to 230am to 340am and later to 420am reason still unknown later we were given coupons to eat from the airport food court this was given after some airgeek rebuked them to follow the rules of flight delay and all that what i heard later on was that it was a trick played by dragonair to cancel the flight for 24 hours and make some savings and amendments frustrated american held a revolt and the dragonair flying to chennai was cancelled and we finally reached bangalore airport at around 78 in the morning the food sucks by the way we have no vegan or vegetarian option everything has egg or fish oil in it the airhostesses were rude and would rebuke in chinese it was so confusing i would not fly dragonair again
2578,air new zealand,9,great service,lovely cabin crew great service seat is good for a short 50min flight like this but not for a longhaul everyone followed the mask regulations food cookies or lollies were served at the end of flight due to covid restrictions
15496,oman air,1,appalling customer service,dubai to nairobi via muscat appalling customer service when other airlines are trying to help customers oman air are not interested rude staff on telephone charging for rebooking after saying they wont refusing to refund they are so busy on facebook telling everyone how great they are but when it comes to after they have taken your money they are not interested i will never use them again
7065,china southern airlines,6,ridiculous for this intense process,my flight supposed departure time is dec 7th 1230 at noon i arrived guangzhou airport at 10am it took me too long time on checkin waiting line before departure there is no notice board what passenger need to prepare for check in except a reminder of china customs health declaration form after 2030 mins waiting i came to check in counter and show every document requested to ground crew of airline ipavisa vaccination report covid19 test results report international travel health certificate and sg airport pcr test reservation everything was fine except my covid19 test report that was written by both english and chinese and provided by formal hospital of liaoning however it was refused as informal certificate then i showed my international travel health certificate which was also not recognized as valid document the clock went to 1120 that time and ground crew requested me to ask a new covid19 report from hospital and find a printer to print every document out the scene was a mess disaster that time the time is tight i was not informed the priority of doing all these things and i was unclear would those document use for boarding the airplane or enter sg customs is that necessary to print all these out at the final time ground crew gave me a declaimer form to sign then they can allow me to board i didnt print documents for tight time my new covid19 test report as requested it has my passport number and date of birth came to me when i was on the flight before i arrived sg however the most dramatic scene is sg customs didnt look my new covid19 test report at all they just checked my international travel health certificate eversion on my phone then let me pass i feel ridiculous for this intense process
5200,ba cityflyer,8,ba cityflyer customer review,london city to mahon and madrid back into city no delay at check in and a breeze through security 15 mins delayed departing lcy with no explanation from ground staff who just seemed slow an ok hot breakfast and tea coffee was welcome though i was surprised that there was no bar service after the meal was served return from madrid was delayed an hour due to the flight deck walk around finding a scrape which needed checking out a drink from the bar was fine but a 18 gram bag of savoury snacks is an insult city flyer remains superior to flying ba from heathrow mainly due to the e190 being a spacious and new plane however with a bit of effort ba could achieve a better level of service especially around catering
9956,flysafair,2,the plane was delayed,i booked my daughter on the flysafair flight sa161 durban to cape town when she checked in this morning she received an sms to tell her the plane was delayed the flight was due to depart at 0930 the revised departure time was 1530 she was advised that she could book another flight with another airline and flysafair would refund us within 14 to 21 working days the knock on effect is that we have to try and arrange new lifts and her meeting at the university would be postponed how is flysafair rated the most on time airline in south africa from now on i will book my daughter on british airways as i travel almost weekly for business and the longest delay has been 15 mins
975,air bagan,5,air bagan customer review,took two domestic flights on air bagan one from yangon to bagan and another mandalay to yangon both flights were with atr72 aircraft the interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space the aircraft definitely showed its old age the flight from mandalay to yangon was free seated and flight was completely full the inflight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy for both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail air bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today
15070,nok air,4,baggage was missing the lock,flight was 20 minutes delayed at phuket airport they have a huge single check in line for all the flights it doesnt matter if you do the online check in it takes a long time you cannot eat your own food on the plane when we arrived to bangkok my checked baggage was missing the lock i asked customer service why they removed the lock and if they could give me the lock back and they said that the lock was not found but they didnt understand our english we decided to go and leave it like that
19181,sriwijaya air,7,sriwijaya air customer review,plmcgk with boeing 737500 the flight was on time good ticket prices no ife but it was fair enough for a 50 minute flight they provided a bread and a cup of mineral water during flight the cabin staff were friendly enough
11548,interjet,1,cannot be trusted,el salvador to mexico city i flew with interjet a week ago i had some luggage vandalised and destroyed with a sharp object i reported the incident immediately at airport a report was taken when i contacted staff of interjet not a single person wanted to help on the phone they hung up at the airport they sent me to another city to report on email they only say automated polite response they stop responding and never helped this is the worst airline no customer service no support do not fly with them worst experience the flights were cancelled they had no airplane for us had to wait an entire day cannot be trusted
4100,allegiant air,6,better than i expected,i flew from austin to orange county ca via allegiant and had a seamless experience after reading all the bad reviews i was nervous but it turns out i was one of the lucky ones my flight had a departure time of 150pm and the gate was in the south terminal away from the main austin terminal about a 12 min drive to the other side my flight started boarding at 105 tsa was easy to get through although they do not have a separate line for tsa precheck after walking up the aircraft i was surprised to see a spacious walking aisle and more legroom than i was expecting the seats are stiff and do not recline but you have lots of room for your legs in standard economy i had a middle seat and was fine definitely bring your own entertainment as there is no wifi or movies available on board also bring snacks and a refillable water bottle filled from the airport for a 120 last minute ticket this was better than i expected we left and landed at the exact time listed i would recommend
21732,vietnam airlines,6,i think it is worth the money,melbourne to ho chi minh city ground service depends which airport your in with melbourne its just average with ho chi minh it could be really slow or really fast i think it is worth the money because when i looked it was about the 2nd cheapest airline and with my point of view that is were it should be seat was pretty comfortable for a domestic and 12 hour flight i wouldnt recommend for any longer flight the food was okay but only had a very small choice for my flight only fish and fried noodles but they had a large variety of drinks the inflight entertainment the screen was only touch screen and they only had wifi connectivity on the new aircraft
2049,air koryo,7,air koryo customer review,pekfnj on their brandnew antonov an148 courteous and professional cabin crew served a lavish hot meal with several different savoury items in little plastic dishes fish chicken salad plus a main of chicken curry plus dessert bread roll tea cider or beer landed on time and formalities to enter north korea went very quickly fnjprk on their tupolev tu204100 wasnt as smooth boarding started early but a small hitch checking in a passenger with an oversize bag halted check in for over half an hour while staff dithered this resulted in a departure an hour late which wasnt made up in the air and i missed my connection to the us necessitating a 24h stay in beijing since i was originally only going to be in transit and not enter china air koryos pek staff had to rebook me before i could enter china which took about an hour the change fee i incurred on my flight to the us was 300 of which air koryo contributed 100 delays happen but this one was so easily avoided will definitely fly air koryo again as they are a very interesting airline compared to the competition air china and have a vastly better onboard product but will be prepared for the odd burst of eccentric behaviour such as this
20120,thai lion air,1,no money and no more contact,flight of march 2020 was logically cancelled we requested a refund which the system said was being processed and could take up to 45 days since then no money and no more contact phoned multiple times waiting time up to an hour and when finally in the call being pressed away again
5327,bangkok airways,9,a very good product for the price,as others have noted the airline is very good when it comes to being on time which is a rarity in thai society and life in general in the kingdom both cabin and ground staff conducted themselves professionally unlike several other shorthaul carriers and its easy to see why bangkok airways stands out among them in a positive light somehow the aircraft was configured in a singleclass configuration so everyone rode in coach legroom seemed to have diminished from the last time i flew with them 5 years back so that was one sore point still a very good product for the price which is just a few pennies more than what other airlines are charging
12481,jetstar asia,5,i was a bit disappointed,i booked this return flight from singapore to kuala lumpur as part of another booking so i didnt choose jetstar it is a discount airline with all of their features the crew were fine and the seat was ok as my ticket was codeshared they offered me extra legroom and more luggage allowance my ticket noted that i was entitled to a lunch but surprisingly i was literally thrown a muffin and a bottle of water i was a bit disappointed because if i had booked with a discount airline i would have expected it
18562,smartwings,5,waived my overweight bags,gatwick to prague they waived my overweight bags because i understood that i could take up to 23 kg without paying and i felt good that they trusted me and said that theyll waive my bags usually you can only take up to 15 kg free my flight was delayed with two hours which is a common occurrence by smartwings as i see in other reviews but it was value for money as i only paid 52 pounds for the ticket same day that i actually am flying we didnt yet fly and i hope all will end well
4764,aurigny air,4,aurigny air customer review,lgwgci used the new online checkin which was simple and saved a lot of time at the airport itself walking out to the aircraft wouldnt be fantastic on a rainy day flight time was just 40 minutes the first impression of the atr72 was that it was quite old and worn and noisy loads very low with 7 free rows in front of me and many behind too staff werent unpleasant but i cant say they were particularly great either just average free drinks and arrival was especially easy we were outside the terminal at guernsey within 5 minutes of the engines being shut down
19394,sunwing airlines,4,knew what to expect with a budget flight,we have flown sunwing before so knew what to expect with a budget flighthotel package to huatulco from vancouver i opt for the premium seats paying an extra 50 each way which gives a bit of legroom in the bulkhead and to be near the washroom but be warned that if you have an aisle seat you will be constantly jostled by people using the facilities if you get a window seat you have to climb over your seat mates and hope they are nice people who dont get annoyed at you stepping on toes banging knees or doing some creative choreography to not end up in their laps facing them and then you have to go through the tiny galley where the flight attendants are scrambling with meal and drink service lets face it this is a flying sardine tin and changing in the tiny closet of a bathroom in or out of weatherappropriate clothing requires the skills of houdini my husband quipped not enough room to change your mind let alone clothes on this trip home we had to drop off passengers in victoria before a very quick flight to our final destination vancouver 11oo pm 100 am huatulco time when landed the passenger count was off for some reason and had to be recounted about 4 times flight attendant was snarky when i asked if a resolution was being worked out and that she didnt have an answer and i should take my seat we missed our takeoff slot during this mishap so what should have been an expedient unloading of victoria passengers and very quick flight home landed us in our airport hotel about 200 am 4 am huatulco time not terrible in comparison to other delays im reading about with this airline they need a major improvement on their menu and execution of said menu my husband was sitting across from the child from hell and his parents this kid had screamed his way through the airport prior to boarding and they wound up on our flight my sympathy for the parents dissolved when a passenger and the dad almost came to blows before the flight attendant intervened later upon take off and landing dad refused to buckle the 4 yr old into his seat and got into an argument with the flight attendant who technically could have thrown them off the plane and wish she would have the kid calmed down for the most part for the rest of the flight however when we were delayed in victoria my husband moved up to sit with me and chat when he returned to his seat the child was sitting in it the child had smeared gum under my husbands shoe and it was ground into the carpet no doubt under the watchful blind eye of his parents i realized in the end that the flight attendants patience had been wearing thin all along and bear her no ill will i also realized that the crews start to christmas day wasnt ideal either then our luggage was delayed my conclusions 1 flying during the busy holiday season can be less than perfect things that cause delays are somewhat mysterious to us civilians and may be based on facts that we arent privy toalthough they could keep us better informed 2 wider aisles and wider seats are desirable but if you buy a bargain package dont expect luxury 3 passenger behaviour and personal foulups may also be the cause of delays
11888,jazeera airways,5,flight staff is very nice and helpful,the flight staff is very nice and helpful airplane is pretty clean barely any delays very cheap they need to improve their online customer service i called them and messaged them on whatsapp many times in a week but they only attended my call once at the very end international calling wasted a lot of my money their part of the kuwait airport is very claustrophobic its very boring because it was very limited on stores and snacks and fast food was very expensive they dont serve snacks i shouldnt complain about this because the flight being cheap makes up for it you have to order food for the flight 24 hours before the flight with money they have something called jazeerascreens which is a flight entertainment website that you can access with their on plane wifi awesome replacement to save money but it only works on phones and didnt work on my laptop
8163,druk air,7,druk air customer review,kathmanduthimpu may 15 thimpubangkok may 20 both 2014 got to see mount everest on first flight in a smallish jetprop plane on second flight i found the meal to be indigestible
21079,tunisair,2,extremely impolite and disrespectful,nouakchott to paris via tunis my first trip was 2 hours late so that i could not get my connection in tunis any more i thought that this was not a big deal but from there on the experience became more and more terrible i was scheduled for another flight 3 hours later but each time the boarding time approached the flight was rescheduled even more the tunisair staff was extremely impolite and disrespectful they would turn away from me in the middle of a sentence not inform me properly on the actual situation and not even try to find solutions in my interest altogether i had a delay of 10 hours the food and water that was provided during this delay were ridiculous once arrived in paris my two bags were missing they were delivered to my hotel 30 hours later tunisair may be the cheapest but the next time i will be willing to spend the double just to avoid them
2486,air new zealand,6,flights on this trip were late,all anz flights on this trip were late this one in particular nz8 was delayed for an hour with no announcements no explanation no plan for customers who would miss connecting flights unacceptable skycouch is a nice product but super expensive at 1000 each way when occupied by one person it works well for 2 children or an adult with 1 child but is too small for 2 adults food and what service there is is the same as the rest of economy the wifi while free did not work
18034,silkair,6,was not really comfortable,singapore to kuala lumpur boeing 737s are always a bad plane to board so this wasnt comfortable but this is the same for every 737 flight boarding was very strange we were asked taken to board via bus but oh my how we were packed in flight was not really comfortable as the plane did not cool down enough drink service only coffee tea juice or water good that it is such a short flight though
22819,wow air,1,disputing the amount i paid,los angeles to keflavik i purchased a flight in may of 2018 for a flight in march 2019 i have been checking periodically to see if the seats are filling up i purchased through a third party vendor and apparently it is only for the economy fare so no luggage or seats so i have been watching to see if i need to purchase them early i havent been able to see the seats since november so in february i emailed customer service to ask why they told me because my flight was cancelled i guess they do not fly out of los angeles anymore much to my surprise because my flight is in 3 weeks no one ever emailed me or called me to notify me i would have been at the airport and had a big surprise now i am trying to get a refund and they are disputing the amount i paid they do not want to pay me approx 300 even though i have sent over screen shots of my credit card showing i paid a total of 1300 it is ridiculous
1144,air cairo,7,air cairo customer review,istanbul to sharm el sheikh and cairo to istanbul the planes were new clean airbus 320 they didnt serve us a hot meal only refreshments butter cookies and a drink even the flights have been delayed for 2 hours on both ways i recommend air cairo
12171,jetairfly,5,we had a 14 hour delay,brussels to cancun with jetairfly booked 4 days before the flight and didnt know what to expect tickets were quite cheap less then 400 we knew there was very strict security so we arrived at the airport 4 hours before takeoff we queued for almost 2 hours we took off on time but there were some gear problems and we had to make an emergency landing after we landed we had to stay in the plane for 1 hour when we finally got out they gave us a voucher for food and told us to come back to the gate at 130 pm when we came back a few hours later the plane still wasnt fixed and again they gave a voucher for food and told us to come back at 530 pm when we came back at 530 pm there was no one from jetairfly who could help us after 1 hour finally someone came and he told us there was another plane who would take us to cancun because it was a new plane we had to get new boarding passes it took them quite a while to do this this was 815 pm unfortunately the boarding system was also broken so they had to manually process everyone by 830 pm we were the first on the plane and after 1 hour we finally took off the new plane didnt have entertainment but because we flew by night that was not a big issue i know jetairfly couldnt do anything about the airplane being broken but when you tell your passengers to be at the gate at 530 pm there has to be at least 1 person available and that was not the case this time after all we had a 14 hour delay the good thing the return flight was much better and we got some money back
19169,sriwijaya air,6,price is quite affordable,i had a flight last week from yogyakarta to jakarta with sriwijaya air check in staff are very friendly i asked where the airplane coming from and she replied with a smile the flight was delayed about 10 or 15 minutes due the traffic congestion in yogya with an hour flight i got a tango snack and a cup of mineral water the seat was good and the airplane little bit hot at that time my main criticism is to their cabin crew which is not quite friendly enough one of the staff doing the safety demonstration did not have any smile or attract any attention from the passengers i think they should smile a lot during the flight overall the flight is good and the price is quite affordable
4780,austrian airlines,8,the crew was very nice,the cabin of austrian was quite a shock as totally outdated no privacy for most seats no direct access to corridor for many seats near the windows and a miserable toilet kit food was excellent wines as well with a very nationalistic touch as only austrian wines the crew was very nice very attentive flight was on time and loading well organised
402,aerolineas argentinas,2,nonexistent catering,nonexistent catering lousy coffee a glass of water in plastic elements nonexistent entertainment and aircraft without usb chargers the chaotic checkin and staff with rude appearances el catering inexistente un cafe malsimo un vaso de agua en elementos de plstico entretenimiento inexistente y las aeronaves sin cargadores de usb el chekin caotico y personal con unas apariencias maleducados
2303,air mauritius,7,its fairly comfortable,mumbai to mauritius return with air mauritius somewhat dated aircraft with very sad ife the flights were on time seats were comfortable food was decent and they still hand out amenity kits not exactly fabulous but its fairly comfortable wouldnt mind flying with them again if they ramp up their frequencies up a bit
7002,china eastern airlines,7,flight was overall fine,flew on china eastern from hong kong to shanghai pudong in october the flight was overall fine and i didnt really have a reason to complain the food was average nothing to win prizes with but given that they offer a full service on a two hours flight that was competitively priced i assume this is not a drawback seat pitch appeared to be above average on this airplane as well would fly them again
951,air austral,8,air austral customer review,mrurunsydnou return high level of service across the board no difference between flying on an atr 72500 and a b777300 the crew were well groomed polite and efficient great creole cuisine with a french savoir fare hot meals for the main services and good open sandwiches in between on demand entertainment system worked well with plenty of choices international magazines available clean lavatories

7706,croatia airlines,6,croatia airlines customer review,lhrzaglhr tried checking in online and twice it crashed at heathrow i asked the check in agent for an empty row in economy as i had seen there were several he sort of grunted and sure enough i was sat in a row with another people so moved to an empty row once the doors closed not sure what the dish was it was a cold croatian pastry filled with cheese not really to my taste immigration in zagreb was disorganised with passengers queuing but those with transfer flights moving to the front so it felt like constantly moving backwards bags took a long time to come out despite the fact only a few passengers had checked in return journey was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to business class lounge was compact and the food available were peanuts cake and canap sized bread that was it the catfish with cold bean salad was again not to my taste in london immigration was quick but we did have to wait 30 minutes plus for our bags it will be interesting to see if croatian improve the offering on this route with a rival airline launching lhrzag flights from december
8138,dragonair,5,dragonair customer review,flight from hkg to tpe december 19 2013 flight delayed by almost 1 hour boarding procedure is very slow aircraft used was an old a330 seats though wide and comfy for an economy is really old and needs upholstery food however is terrible and the worst ive seen in a full service airline
4576,asiana airlines,4,reassess their baggage policy,i recently flew with asiana airlines from almaty to sydney with my two young preschool children we arrived slightly late to the flight two of our checkin bags were slightly over the standard weight limit of 23 kilograms asiana airlines insisted that we either repack our bags to fit within the 23kilogram limit or pay a significant fee for the excess weight i requested an exception to be made based on our circumstances the regional manager exhibited rudeness and a lack of understanding this service was not only disappointing but also added unnecessary stress to an already challenging experience i urge asiana airlines to reassess their baggage policy to allow for reasonable flexibility
15482,oman air,2,refund my money after 1 year,our flight got canceled due to the covid 19 initially they promised to refund our money immediately refund form submit through travel agency after 90 days of refund request oman airlines advised that they have changed the policy and will refund my money after 1 year of the purchase date of my ticket we have spent 11000 a year go and still waiting for oman air to answer my phone calls air asia refunded our money after 3 months of refund request
4435,ana all nippon airways,4,the food was below average,flew ana from sydney to haneda economy and haneda to heathrow premium economy and same reverse premium economy was via a bid process flight for economy was reasonable for the cost while the premium economy wasnt as expected in that the degree of recline was less than i expected the range of movies on the vod system was very limited and the food was below average customer service from the fas was however excellent where they were very attentive and courteous immediatly offering eye masks and ear plugs on boarding
18715,south african airways,8,really impressive service,east london to london via johannesburg really impressive service on saa to deal with a late departure on a domestic flight by an hour with an already tight connection onto a long haul flight from johannesburg on boarding and making the cabin crew aware of my concern they smiled and reassured that i would make it no problem this was confirmed when the captain announced during his pretakeoff message that he was aware of a passenger connecting to london and some others onto munich that he had alerted this to the ground staff in johannesburg and that there would be staff waiting at the gate on arrival to whisk us through to the connecting flights exactly that happened it was a pleasure to see everything work as promised and took the stress out of a worrying situation saa must be commended somehow despite their near bankruptcy but that is another story for offering generous food and alcohol giving two bottles of wine instead of one two liqueur miniatures etc on their flights a notable contrast to their two competitors virgin and ba on this route where cost cutting is so obvious cooked breakfast and three dinner options still offered and flight attendants that enjoy their jobs and want to serve their customers only gripe was on boarding on the return at lhr five people were struggling to locate their seats a family had been split up across the totally full plane and no staff were present or visible to assist they all were in the galley before takeoff chatting and when i went back to let them know if someone could assist they looked irritated small blemish though on 4 very good flights my luggage on the return was not on the belt in johannesburg after a worrying 15 minutes the baggage enquiries desk confirmed it had mistakenly been transferred onto my next flight and it was there at my final destination keep in up saa
9449,finnair,4,like a budget long haul flight,first flight was poor seat backs were like bricks no food no viewing screens 3 hr flight second flight had a problem so had to get off the plane and wait on another 1st plane seat was good but when seated back on new aircraft same seat number it turned out to be a seat with no seat in front good some would say for leg room but the tray table did not fold and as im a large guy could not get it down there was no headphone for the screen which seemed odd the original girl beside me had switched with her husband and he being a large guy as well made the flight awkward he was much larger than me the best is the food piece of chicken with cauliflower and spinach not nice at all with a tiny bread bun salad bowl thing which i passed on and a chocolate wafer bar poor offerings and not plentiful at all landing was only an hour late so no worries but before we landed at 530 pm we were given a small box contain 2 wet hash browns and a few mushrooms with an omelette on more spinach breakfast the seats were fine the staff were nice but i really think this was like a budget long haul flight and i will not be flying with them again until people start raving about how good they are one more thing dublin had 2 of the worst and slowest check in staff out of 3 appalling how they did not show any interest in being professional
6456,caribbean airlines,8,caribbean airlines customer review,the lounge at jfk terminal 4 is well appointed and nicely laid out with a decent selection of drinks and food boarding was punctual we were seated in 1a and 1c a soft drink was offered before takeoff seats were leather and old style first class with adequate leg room shortly after takeoff we were offered drinks mot and chandon champagne and nuts caribbean airlines now offer you the chance to preorder your meal and i had chosen a tiger prawn masala with a vegetarian biryani for my partner without a doubt these were two of the best airline meals we have tasted drinks were topped up throughout the flight by crew who were delightful chatty pleasant and a pleasant change from the norm our saturday night flight landed 30 minutes early and we left relaxed and pleased with our choice
2642,air nostrum,5,disappointed with air nostrum,disappointed with air nostrum air nostrum said that due to a change of aircraft the crj 1000 instead of the atr 72 was not fit to land at san sebastian airport for technical reasons how come a bigger aircraft like the a319 of vueling can land in such airport they diverted us to pamplona the flight was delayed more than 2 hours finally in pamplona they took us in a bus to san sebastian but instead of using the shortest route by motorway the bus driver told us he was taking the longer route i reached my destination almost 3 hours later than i was supposed to
6790,cebu pacific,8,overall a good experience,manila to busuanga self checkin and dropoff of the case was quick and effective the aircraft made a wellmaintained impression the seat spacing was good the onboard staff were friendly and the food could be expanded against payment overall a good experience
10546,go first,4,get ready to face some surprises,airline dont care about passengers luggage you can see my luggage pictures attached this was brand new luggage only 10 days old when i checked in there was not a single spot on the bag and when received my luggage in amritsar it was hard for me to recognize my luggage it was full of oil stains and very dirty more over when i tried to complain to the go first staff instead admitting and finding the solution they were telling me this is not happened by them and cant do anything this is not oil stains and we dont know how and where your luggage get messed up i told them you check any footage you can find there was nothing wrong with my luggage but all that was wastage of time i have decided will never travel again in this airline and i will suggest every one else before you book on this airline get ready to face some surprises
3609,airbaltic,6,it wasnt that bad,st petersburg to prague via riga it wasnt that bad after all no cabin baggage weighing or measuring as mentioned in some reviews there was nice staff greeting us on board and the plane was clean ife consisted only from the inflight magazine but it was pretty thick enough reading for two hours flight no food snacks or water during the flight but you know that before taking the flight as the companys strategy is going lowcost
11167,iberia,9,iberia provided a good flight,iberia provided a good flight on time clean airplanes did not miss the connecting flight despite short time the boarding on the bombardiers is a bit messy all the people just standing on the tarmac leaving the suitcases unattended it is a nice carrier but it tends to overbook meet a few costumers that has that problem
4135,alliance airlines,6,seem to be doing acceptable job,gladstone to brisbane i booked this flight through virgin australia website but later i found out that virgin ceased his service for some cities and gave it over to a new commercial airline called alliance airlines the aircraft was a fokker 70 with old interior look the legroom was very tight the airlines magazine was the only entertainment on board which hadnt been prepared tastefully on the positive side the crew were the most friendly cabin crew ive seen in australian airlines the complimentary snack it was a 730am flight was better than what virgin used to offer however the only drink available was water it is expected for an airline to offer coffee and tea in the morning at least they can sell a few options on board the flight time was shorter than usual as it wasnt a propeller aircraft handling at both airport was done by virgin australia so it wasnt really related to this review generally its good that a new competitor is entering the market as a beginner in this sector they seem to be doing acceptable job but they should improve some issues to become a rival to other airlines in regional australia
7701,croatia airlines,8,croatia airlines customer review,we travelled on 4th september 2013 from lhr to rjk returning on 11th september both flights airbus 319 recaro seats comfortable enough for a 2hr flight aircraft clean stewardesses friendly light snack and drinks given flights on time pleasant experience
4735,aurigny air,5,aurigny air customer review,i flew from jersey to alderney via guernsey and experienced delays not really a problem as had been warned by telephone of the delay in guernsey and the fact that it happened in jersey was immaterial everyone was perfectly friendly and civilised however a few days later i flew from alderney to gatwick via guernsey and while the flight was fine and everything on time i found the ground and cabin staff to be offhand at the very least and was made to feel as if i was an idiot when i undid my seatbelt to pay for my drink and when i asked for information on arrival in guernsey i really think that as a small airline if they want to attract customers they should give their staff better training in their general approach just a smile and a pleasant way of speaking would be an improvement on a sigh and a grimace
373,aeroflot russian airlines,4,my luggage did not arrive,madrid to guangzhou via moscow i would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster a friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her she had given me a heads up that i would have to go from one end of the moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight she also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive she knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before i did the flight from madrid to moscow flight 2501 arrives at 550 pm at terminal d then you have to get though security to get to terminal f in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 705 pm from gate 57 at terminal f which is the second to the last gate i literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight if i had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line i would have missed my flight once i arrived in guangzhou i was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day so why have a route so tight that will cause passengers luggage to always arrive a day late if the airline is going to keep this schedule they need to at least warn passengers that their luggage will arrive late and warn them that if they want to make their connecting flight they need to run to make it on board why not make the layover time a bit longer and avoid so many problems
14231,luxair,4,luxair customer review,luxcdg on a erj and back on new q400 as always both flights arrived perfectly on time checkin in a rush but unfortunately the ground staff wasnt the friendliest seats very comfortable with plenty of legroom on both types but the best of all were the tasty snacks they served during the short flights a very pleasant experience
16137,play,6,play airlines is truly a budget ride,play airlines is truly a budget ride the seats are unpadded and thin everything has a charge carry on roller board or checked luggage etc the legroom is slightly more than an american carrier air is not exchanged very frequently and cabin pressure is not ideal my ears stayed tight for several days and i had difficulty hearing not what one wants when they are a musician baggage handling isnt good so dont take pricey luggage on the plus side the flights arrive either ahead of schedule or on time if you are looking for the cheapest travel option possible this is for you
8063,dragonair,9,cabin crew are very nice,dragonair is part of cathay pacific from hong kong to guangzhou is less than 100 miles but they provide an excellent service when on board cabin crew deliver a bottle of water and a cookie the cabin crew are very nice
5911,boutique air,3,refuse to provide adequate help,disgusted with this company i flew early december and my flight was canceled things happen i get it even though they strung us along at the airport postponing the flight for 4 hours before finally canceling it per their policy if the flight is canceled they will provide reimbursement with a variety of options ie mealsridesrental car up to a certain amount i was to be reimbursed for about 90 and sent in all my paperwork receipts etc it took 6 weeks to get a check that was not authorized meaning i couldnt cash it i called their customer service number which was an out of country call center and was promised a new check would be sent it never was i have made 45 calls every 4 weeks or so requesting a new check and have gotten no where on this issue some reps say it has not been processed through accounting some have said its been sent and itll be here soon but nothing its now midapril and i think its safe to say this company sucks and i will not see my reimbursement dont fly with this company they refuse to provide adequate help to their customers completely pathetic
18952,spirit airlines,1,a motive to harass the customers,i and my wife travelled on 9th july from las vegas to san jose discourteous in not serving a cup of water before boarding i asked air hostess a cup of water as i wanted to take medicines myself being a senior citizen she told that flight would take off no issue bur after flight take off no response from the air hostess however the male crew was bringing ordered food then i told him which was after half an hour take off then he arranged cup of water through air hostess by travelling in spirit airlines even the basic need for water in a cup is denied even after paying 30 dollars for checked in luggage we were asked to carry the luggage despite our difficulty in carrying it what is the purpose of collecting baggage charges does spirit airlines has a motive to harass the customers it is not the cheapest fare alone matters a minimum travel comfort and courtesy is expected
14133,lufthansa,2,they have practised cost cutting,lufthansa used to be a very good airline but in recent years they have practised cost cutting to a level that impacted customer experience food and service quality and is simply not acceptable anymore for a flag carrier i had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with lowcost airlines than during my last 8 or so lufthansa flights there seem to be barely any lh flights that leave and arrive on time in the last week i took five lh flights and every single one of them was delayed at this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and in addition there were no baggage handlers available so we finally took off 40 mins late i specifically booked a seat in the first row because i have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that lh changed my seat and i was bumped back a few rows as there was no change pf aircraft there must have been somebody more important than i which is not a good feeling i would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters so much about recognising loyalty which doesnt seem to have a significant role in lufthansas playbook anymore food portions were so small that i thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal over the last years the food at lh got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller the food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts no idea what kind of meat being german myself i do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country but i just dont see why people of cultural backgrounds other the german would eat this i suppose the food in business was not worth more than about 3 euros there is no free food or drink service in economy at all the only thing lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple no joke so heres the verdict with lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats at least not on short or medium distance flights there is no free food or drink service in exonomy class loyalty recognition is nonexistent food is terrible and comes in appetiser portions only i cant see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser but for the extra price of the premium ticket one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne
18363,sky airline,7,sky airline customer review,departure on time from santiago to punta arenas 2 stopovers are too many for such a flight in puerto montt and in balmaceda onboard service is fine we asked for a blanket without any problem food service ok snacks and beverage between each stopover cheep flights flight schedule respected i recommend it if you allow yourself an entire day to fly from santiago to punta arenas
22916,xiamen airlines,9,the seats are comfortable,xiamen to amsterdam the flight attendants are kind willing to assist with cabin luggage the english they speak is okay the seats are comfortable and stuff like long socks blankets earphones and pillows are offered most of the time i fly solo with xiamen airlines but this june when i flew with my partner german nationality they offered great help both by email and at the airport for my partners 144 hours transit visa free the food and beverages onboard is good for breakfast and dinner they have at least two options between chinese and western food the dishes taste good and the portion is big during late night they offer sandwiches and hand out some warm towels or tea before landing breakfast is offered the content of movies is a bit limiting for hollywood movies but theres a big collection of chinesejapanese and korean series and films
13686,level,9,recommend highly this airline,paris to montreal excellent brand new aircrafts very happy one of the best airlines i have seen even their safety movie is different fun and modern i recommend highly this airline

5222,bahamasair,3,worst communication ive seen from any airline,our flight from nassau to great exuma was delayed 1 hour then they changed the gate without letting anyone know almost half the plane was running to the gate for final boarding on the return from ggt to nassau we were delayed 2 hours with no explanation and no communication ive flown all around the world and this is the worst communication ive seen from any airline not run very well in my opinion management needs to look at improving themselves i would look at western air next time we come to bahamas
3484,airasia x,7,flight was not that full,auckland to kuala lumpur with a short stopover at gold coast the flight was not that full and the plane was able to depart 5 minutes early the flight was smooth all the way until a few hours before landing turbulence was evident but the captain was able to minimise it this time the food that i ordered roast chicken with stuffing and cranberry gravy was really dry and the accompanying vegetables were unpalatable landing at kul was a bit bumpy
10933,hawaiian airlines,6,such a bad customer service,kahului airport i was traveling with two kids and an infant we got our bag tagged and only seen my infants paper ticket upon checking in my bag and my daughters car seat the lady who assisted us kept yelling at me for a good 6 mins bc i didnt see my ticket printed and it dropped on the ground i was about to show her my eticket and she did not even bother and told me she didnt need that and she demanded the paper ticket she literally kept yelling at me trying to explain how she needed the ticket in order for her to scan she told me to go back to the self service to check if i dropped my ticket in which she could have just easily printed it herself because she had already verified my id i went back and grabbed my ticket from the floor and gave it to her she then told me she didnt need it because she will print a new set of tickets such a bad customer service rude and disrespectful af she shouldnt be in a customer service industry with that rude attitude of hers
19054,srilankan airlines,1,beyond shocking service,our flight from sri lanka ul225 was on 7 april at 625pm we arrived at the airport 3 hours before only to be told that the flight was delayed to 810pm we waited at the boarding gate until 9pm before being told it was delayed again until 10pm at 10pm we were told it was delayed until 7am the following day there was utter chaos and no one knew what was going on eventually we got told we would be put into a hotel for the night we only arrived at the hotel at 130am we were told we would be fetched at 4am for our 7am flight we woke up at 4am to find out we would now be fetched at 6am as our flight was delayed again until 915am eventually we got on the flight at 915am and took off the tvs werent working properly so we only had 1 movie option which wasnt in english and the seats were rock hard after 35 minutes of flying the captain made an announcement that the planes windscreen had cracked and we needed to make an emergency landing back in colombo on arrival at the airport we were informed that the flight has been cancelled they had no further information as to when we would be able to fly their next flight that night only had space for 30 people out of the hundreds on the flight we were last on the list to fly as we were not a family with children and were not fasting so we were told we would maybe fly on monday it was now saturday midday and we had already been at the airport for nearly 24 hours we asked if we could get a refund they said they could not guarantee anything we eventually had to book a one way flight to dubai that afternoon with another airline in order to get home which cost double what our return trip with sri lankan airways cost whether or not we will get refunded i dont know as they dont reply to your emails and on top of that we lost over 1000usd booking a new flight home for the 2 of us beyond shocking service will never ever recommend them to anyone
22527,vueling airlines,2,undermines trust and confidence,the vueling website has proven to be deceptive and misleading offering a false sense of economy during the ticket purchasing process this unsettling experience unfolds when customers are denied access to the cost of their hand luggage until after they have already made the payment for their ticket to their dismay they are then confronted with an additional charge of 45 euros for the privilege of bringing their hand luggage on board such practices are both disingenuous and unfair as customers should be provided with transparent and accurate information regarding all associated costs prior to committing to a purchase by intentionally withholding essential details until after payment vueling undermines the trust and confidence of its customers tarnishing the overall experience of using their services in an era where consumers expect honesty and integrity from companies this unfortunate incident highlights a severe lack of transparency on vuelings part to foster trust and maintain a reputable image it is crucial for businesses to prioritize open communication and upfront disclosure of all relevant fees and charges potential travelers must be made aware of the hidden costs of hand luggage from the outset allowing them to make informed decisions and avoid any unpleasant surprises by rectifying these misleading practices and adopting a more honest approach vueling would not only regain the trust of its customers but also ensure a more positive and respectful customer experience
1538,air dolomiti,6,air dolomiti customer review,frequently flown frankfurt to milan linatemalpensa or munich to milan malpensa airline is good and generally on schedule but to my utter disappointment the snack on the return leg frequently is only nonvegetarian planes are usually small so one can expect a bumpy flight
160,aegean airlines,7,service was good and attentive as always with this airline,early morning flight due to flight schedule changes three months in advance notice flight jmkath left early and arrived nearly 20 minutes ahead of schedule in athens despite a nearly 2 hour connection one of our priority tagged bags did not make it together with 30 other bags on the flight from ath to cph it is quite impressive that gold air handling missed a whole trolley of bags flight to cph was fine good service and quite nice new seats in business class empty middle seat breakfast ok not fantastic service was good and attentive as always with this airline bag trouble took 1 hour to register in cph friendly service but took a while one of our bags arrived on the wrong bag belt after us asking where it was the other bag was left in athens bag arrived following day late at night on a strange bag delivery service as i had to come down to the delivery truck and visually point at my bag strange and not very professional bottom line poor to lose a priority bag in a two hour connection and by the way i do not like the way this airline randomly pick on economy people to weigh their bags in my opinion is either all or none not some poor people who has to face a huge cost because of one kg overweight hand luggage what is really the point of upsetting people the airline should know that if they write max 5kg hand luggage people will bring 10 if they write 8 they will bring 12 build this in to the business model
677,air algerie,9,service onboard was excellent,london to algiers there was a slight delay but the service onboard was excellent clean very nice food and friendly personnel very pleased with the whole experience would fly air algerie again
16645,ravn alaska,4,never be using ravn again,ravn alaska is so frustrating first off your carryon items will all pretty much have to be checked unless theyre tiny so my husband and i shortchecked our carryon bags to our next airline since the next airline we transferred to would have enough room to stow them overhead then we took this tiny 19seater plane which once boarding was finished started up the engines only to have them shut off three times before the stewardess announced something is wrong the pilots are going to try fix it thats comforting and gave out cookies to passengers to shift focus finally we were told by the pilots that there was a technical issue that could be deferred for now and once they get paperwork done then we can take off at one point early on we were told it would be about 15 more minutes then about half an hour later they said itll be about 10 more minutes until takeoff overall we were delayed in the plane sitting there prerunway for an hour and our next layover was 1 hr 20 min so when we arrived at the next airport we had literally 10 minutes until the next plane terminal would close the gate to deplane get our bags from baggage claim go through security and run to our next gate upon deplaning we asked the ground crew if we could just grab our shortchecked bags right there on the tarmac they said no we were told the baggage claim was close by which it wasnt my husband and i ran not a good idea when youre 7 months pregnant and not a runner by nature he ran to baggage claim to get our bags while i ran to our next gate to try keep the door open until my husband arrived with our bags as soon as i arrived i was told to get onboard right now and when i begged them to wait just a couple minutes for my husband who was running up as we spoke they said they could not and closed the door right in front of me thanks a lot ravn for making us shortcheck our appropriately sized carryons having technically unsound planes being untruthful about how much more time wed be delayed on the tarmac not letting us grab our shortchecked bags after deplaning and not apparently notifying the next gate that multiple passengers including us were delayed and on their way running to he gate it ruined our night and our trip home and we felt so ripped off by this airline we will certainly never be using ravn again and have let our friends know to avoid this airline as well
11057,hong kong airlines,7,fraught with red tape,ground staff at osaka airport require more training my partner and i arrived in hong kong on 29 october we are both british passport holders although i also have a hong kong id card my partner has leave to stay in hong kong for 6 months and this is clearly stated on a slip attached to his passport we took a trip to kyoto via osaka for 6 days everything was fine on the outward journey but the return trip yesterday was fraught with red tape first despite having checked in online 48 hours before we had to get our boarding passes at the checkin desk at osaka airport it was really frustrating as we only had hand luggage we saw 5 members of the staff attending to one lady customer while the queue grew ever longer little did we know that we would have the same attention the girl at the counter asked my partner how long he waswould be staying in hong kong wanted to see his return ticket to england etc we pointed out the page where it stated that he could stay until april 2017 of he wanted but she sought advice from a colleague and then 4 more joined her we couldnt to get them to understand that he can stay in hk for 6 months eventually they asked my partner to sign a release of indemnity the process of queuing and grilling lasted from 1425 to 1550 they were all very polite and very apologetical in fact 2 gentlemen later saw us at the gate and apologised again for their lack of english but it was no less frustrating and annoying for us my partner could not have been the only british passport holder in this situation i think that with more training the checkin staff could have more confidence to deal with similar situations other than that we were happy flying with hong kong airlines on such short haul flights
13909,lion air,5,seats were not very well spaced out,the flight from berau to jakarta was in two parts we flew from berau to balikpapan on a atr 72500 of wings air which was quite comfortable since i got a first row seat and was thankfully on time since there is nothing to do at berau airport the check in process was smooth and hassle free the balikpapan to jakarta leg was delayed almost 2 hours thankfully i had planned a long gap before international connection to mumbai to singapore the lion air leg of the flight was relatively less comfortable and the seats were not very well spaced out so i would say it was ok but would definitely would not plan a flight with lion air if time is critical
4561,arkefly,8,arkefly customer review,curamscur premium comfort class worth the extra euro 200 2x3x2 seats configuration instead of 2x4x2 on b767 enough legroom only 5 rows with own cabin staff welcome drink 2 good meals snack alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks included one minus even though the distance between the seats is big the seats cannot recline any further than in the other classes
13393,lan peru,3,lan peru customer review,mexlimmex in business class the outward flight left at midnight with an arrival time of 530am approx this was too short a flight to catch up on much sleep although the plane was new or refurbished almost flat beds and a large screen with avod a full meal service was offered but i decided to get some shuteye instead and slept through until just before landing no breakfast or snack which would have been a nice alternative to the late night meal basic amenity kit no toothbrush and no hot towels prior to landing return flight on a shabby 767 with reclining seats but no avod plane in need of refurbishment with chipped paintwork and frayed carpets fas came round with a drink prior to takeoff and started taking orders for lunch soon after reaching cruising altitude lunch was adequate with an ok choice of chilean wines beers spirits etc the orange juice and coffee instant were undrinkable fas attentive and attempted to get my name right both flights were on time although there was a longish delay for baggage at mex on return caused by thorough checks by sniffer dogs probably to be expected on this route
17636,saudi arabian airlines,6,i would not recommend saudia,i flew from london to new delhi india with saudia on 23rd of september 2022 my layover at jeddah was changed from 12 to 24 hours and i am informed only a day before flying when i reach jeddah and ask if i am being accommodated in a hotel i am being told the airline is not responsible the staff was rude and impolite he told me to complain about the delay on the customer care as if writing at the last hour would solve my problem when he in person was not ready to entertain me they have all the time to send you emails regarding upgrades for business class but they dont have time to send you emails about the delay i was probably expected to take a transit visa and find a hotel somewhere in jeddah city which i have never visited and that also at night the airlines was least bothered about my safety and discomfort first they do not inform you about the delay on time and then put all the blame on you on top of that wifi at jeddah airport was not working what a bizarre situation i was in i would not recommend saudia if you have other options in hand though i have no complains about onboard facilities flying attendants were good the food was tasty with more options
19949,thai airasia,7,hot seat which was comfortable,cochin to bangkok departed cochin airport on time this time i booked their hot seat which was comfortable comparing to the standard seat the pre booked meal was ok will fly again with thai airasia in this sector
18222,singapore airlines,6,not as good i was expecting,i was looking forward very much to the experience on singapore airlines and even more so the a380 i was in the bulkhead seat in premium economy so the very first row on the lower level it was a nice smooth flight the ife was adequate but i was a little disappointed with the level of service ive always heard about how attentive the singapore girl ieflight attendants on sq were the service was far from the worst i have ever had on an airline but not as good as i anticipated maybe i was comparing it to the absolute best service i have ever had on an airline i flew on my last overseas flight a taipeibased airline dont get me wrong it was not bad at all just not as good i was expecting
16983,royal brunei airlines,5,horrific experience,london to melbourne via brunei horrific experience travelling solo with a 15month old i understand that he does not pay so doesnt automatically get a seat he sat on my lap for the first 15 hours staff offered no support with helping me with bags to entertain him while i needed the toilet etc they didnt provide a meal for him when i asked they told me i should have specially requested one i asked for them to do this for the second leg of the trip they didnt when asked if they could provide some fruit i was told by one staff member we only give it out at snack times to the adult passengers the nappy change table is a weird oval shape and the babies legs hang over setting the sensors for the tap off its hard enough changing in limited space but the nappy change table meant some creative yoga poses the second leg the flight was half empty my child was once again on my lap i asked if i could move to the row in front so he could lay on the spare seat and we could both get some sleep i was told no that those seats you have to pay more for they were identical to the one i was sitting on i asked to speak to someone more senior who then agreed there is no way ill be flying with brunei again for the poor service the airport is horrific nothing to do basically no food to purchase other than chocolate and crisps go with someone else
4727,aurigny air,5,aurigny air customer review,we had a weekend trip to guernsey from gatwick both flights were late on the return flight seated at the back of the aircraft i was subject to the flight attendants conversation grumbling about their job and their employer i feel a little put off from making future leisure trips to guernsey as this airline is quite expensive suffers delays and does not provide the warmest service
3600,airbaltic,3,better use ryanair or wizz air,riga to dsseldorf got charged 60 extra because my backpack was a bit too heavy for hand luggage so i had to check it in as a normal bag it costs 60 no debate i will try to prevent flying with airbaltic in the future better use ryanair or wizz air they dont try to charge you 60 extra for backpack that is a bit too heavy
13446,lao airlines,7,very friendly and efficient,flew with lao airlines from hanoi to vientiane in their a320 the aircraft is starting to show its age they have a ptv installed at each seat but it was not working no sign of the ptv controller to be seen too servicewise the whole crew was very young and all of them were very friendly and efficient a simple snack box consisting of a sandwich and water was distributed followed by a drink round the seat was okay and everything was good for this short flight of 50 minutes
22989,xiamen airlines,7,a mixed bag,xiamen to amsterdam bit of a mixed bag the food and seat comfort were quite decent but a few other issues would make me think before travelling with xiamen airlines again cabin crew had very limited english to the point they didnt understand the word vegetarian when they came around with the meal the cabin temperature fluctuated greatly on the flight and to make matters worse i was sat next to overweight passenger who smelt strongly of alcohol and had no concept of personal space after he had elbowed me for about the 10th time i decided to look for another seat but by now everyone was sleeping and simply decided to stick it out i could have asked one of the crew but given their level of english i thought better of it the economy seats have uk style power sockets so useful for laptops as the inflight entertainment is somewhat limited although the screen and entertainment system was quick with none of the usual lags i have experienced on other airlines
20728,tigerair australia,2,lived up to its reputation for unreliable service,coolangatta to melbourne tigerair is the most disorganised organisation i have dealt with my travel agent calls me following a notification they received 24 hours before my departure that my flight departure is no longer 335 pm but is 605 pm because of car hire i have to return to the airport at 330 pm or incur additional fees i check tigerair website on the morning of my departure and it says i am departing at the original time of 335pm confused i call a tigerair consultant you again tells me the departure time is 335 pm after checking the company website when i query that and tell them of the alert i had received about my flight being delayed the consultant makes a deeper investigation and then confirms the update is correct the departure time is 605 pm the fact the consultants depend on a website that is not properly maintained to give accurate information to travellers is maddening tigerair has lived up to its reputation for unreliable service and i will not be flying with them again
18364,sky airline,7,sky airline customer review,santiago to puerto montt return flights on time service efficient and polite although not over the top aged b737200 well over 20 years old but that is one of the reason i selected sky for the cost cant really go wrong and would recommend for anyone who either is price conscious or loves flying different aircraft
18411,sky express airlines,2,i have never seen anything like it,the organisation at athens airport was simply unbelievable inept i have never seen anything like it the airline was supposed to operate windows 5361 but the queues were enormous due to insufficient staffing and poor management of the huge queues we were nor the only ones who barely made our flight some did not we were in the queue for almost two hours having arrived to the airport 2hr 15min before the flight takeoff the crew on the plane were outstandingly good and deserve credit everything else requires improvement
16435,qantas airways,4,really downgraded the quality,qantas have really downgraded the quality of their international economy class service particularly the food offering this flight had 2 meals dinner and breakfast both of which were very basic compared to previously just a small foil covered tray of hot food and a single additional sweet item no salads bread sauces fruit etc my flight immediately before this one was jal from paris to tokyo the superiority of the jal economy service and product compared to qantas was huge jal had more leg room far greater food offering and far more attentive staff qantas and jal are both premium priced airlines unfortunately qantas no longer is providing a premium offering at least in economy class
22917,xiamen airlines,4,crew were really pleasant,dublin to xiamen via amsterdam the crew were really pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful very clean plane and comfortable seat the usual lie flat entertainment was so poor with a very small selection of movies maybe we expect more as the westernmideastern airlines give you a really decent selection the food was below par and no great shakes at all big nono they did not serve any vodka this is a very first for me on any airline worldwide and i fly 3040 times a year with gin is this possibly the worlds most popular white spirt i only drink an odd vodka and tonic so i went without however for the value and it was an offer i had to give 4 stars other airlines for my destination were 4500 more expensive and that is a big saving if the fare narrows to 2250 i would fly another
15322,nouvelair,3,nouvelair customer review,we left manchester 40 minutes late 020612 and were seated 1a 1b the aircraft was tsini the oldest of their fleet the cabin interior was tired and the seats were uncomfortable before departure the cabin crew did not come round to check everyone had their seat belts on bags stowed etc the safety demo was spoken in bad english the flight was very uneventful about an hour into the flight they started their one and only service for the flight which consisted of soft drinks and hot drinks sandwiches and beer they had very little stock no tax or duty free service on a couple of occasions the purser left the flight deck door wide open whist chatting to the captain 3 hours and 15 minutes we landed and we were all glad of it after speaking to some other passengers on the flight at our hotel there were a number of broken seats about half way down the aircraft on the return flight 16612 we were delayed approximately 60 minutes our aircraft was ts inl second oldest in their fleet our seats we 23c 23d and the aircraft looked in a better state of repair and the crew were much more helpful we had 1 drinksfood service and the only alcoholic drink they serve is beer they also did their tax and duty free service the crew were happy enough for you to purchase alcohol on this service and open the bottle to drink for your flight all in all i was pretty disappointed by thomas cook using this airline as were a lot of other people we spoke to there if you want any food or drink for your flights take it with you
4244,american airlines,2,everything with them is chaotic,chaotic everything with them is chaotic from ticketing to arrival checking in is chaotic dropping off bags chaotic they change gates seats sometimes arrive early others late from crew to ticketing agents all rude my flight just got confused and landed in dulles instead of dca so 1 hour late
6851,china airlines,3,worst flight ive ever been on,new york to taipei this is the worst flight ive ever been on in my life i got a discount on this flight and the stewardesses were nice everything else about was a nightmare i called a week in advance and had to pay for the desired seat i wanted for 30 extra because this airline doesnt let you choose your seat but they ended up giving me the wrong seat anyway rather than 40e which is larger they could not fix the issue on the plane so i was stuck with the tiny seat and wasted my 30 some seats can lift the armrest but the one i had to go to could not and was quite uncomfortable i then learned that this was the first flight ive been on that doesnt offer free wifi i had to pay 50 specifically 4390 to use their very bad wifi service the entertainment tablet doesnt work even if you rub it or clean it and theres nothing on there youve ever heard of anyway the food looked inedible but thats okay because i opted not to eat anyway it just sucks you have to pay for water since tsa obviously doesnt let you bring any liquids on guess i shouldve brought a bigger water bottle sixteen hours of this and they dont even offer you wifi or working power outlets though im surprised we even had those this airline just seems cheap even if their actual prices arent that cheap
2626,air niugini,1,air niugini customer review,i have the misfortune of using air niugini often through lack of choice most recent flight was pom sin return the airline is now leasing an aging white airlines a310 which is older than the previous b767 seats are appalling ife does not work and toilets are constantly unservicable the food is passable but really nothing special service is slow and cabin crew seem unable to deal with complaints or concerns raised by passengers overall air niugini is not deserving of a three star ranking a two star ranking would be more appropriate given the decline in the airlines international services
8027,delta air lines,3,horrible experience,i am pregnant and was cleared by my gynecologist to fly i had to use restroom while plane had few minutes to taxi i asked the crew if i can use restroom real quick as plane was delayed to take off on timethey said no and i went back to be seated when plane was landing at destination airport they had specific announcement that do not use restroom while landing because they have spacious ones at airport that was unnecessary as no one asked about it and not even going to use it and rude at the same time horrible experience they made me feel stupid about the situation
5859,bmi regional,6,chop and change routes,not a bad airline but there are certain things that people should be made aware about them they constantly chop and change routes meaning that you can book a flight thinking that you will be going a certain time but then emailed to tell you later that that flight no longer operates this happened to me i had to book a hotel and take a half day off work at the last minute simply because they had changed their route times staff are good planes comfortable if a little long in the tooth could do with some upgrading inside i used to fly with bmi many years ago on exact same planes they have not changed any at all snack and drink included but prices are not the cheapest and on some routes simply expensive all in decent airline had better though but also had worse
22841,wow air,2,not honour seating selection,baltimore to gatwick via keflavik be aware if you choose to book premium seating and change your flight after paying the penalty fee for changing flights wow air will not honour your previous seating selection even if it was prepaid on your previous booking
3382,airasia philippines,4,we find it affordable,we are frequent flyer of airasia philippines since we find it affordable and were comfortable with your company but theres a need to be calibrated when it comes to your hand carry bags requirements were able to fly from manila to tagbilaran via airasia on october 14with our backpacks as hand carry but when we were about to fly back they insist one of our backpacks to be checked in because of the size we asked them how airasia manila was able to allow us without checking it in and they are not they are not even accomodating to help us
16119,play,8,everything is by social media,the flight was on time the plane appeared new and clean a lot of space even in economy service was courteous and attentive overall a very pleasant surprise they charge for every single item but the total price was about 30 cheaper than the alternative the only negative is that they are not hooked into the tsapre system fairly minor point in baltimore somehow strange experience in that you have very little interaction with human employees in the process in keflavik you check in your own case scan it and put it on the conveyor belt yourself no telephone number to call everything is by social media they do not have inflight entertainment or wifi
11056,hong kong airlines,6,drink and hot snack are served free,hong kong to chengdu hong kong airlines is the low cost hong kong airline owned by hainam airlines it costs 13 flying them compared to cathay pacific so i shall have no complaints the seat pitch is tighter than cathay or other airlines it was a dinner time flight and drink and hot snack are served free no complaints as expectation was not high to be fair
16777,rex airlines,8,meal was fine for a short flight,i enjoyed the flight check in was very easy the service on the plane was very friendly and helpful the meal was fine for a short flight the wine served was excellent i hope rex is here to stay
21887,virgin australia,5,didnt provide us with a snack for free,i just paid 950 for a flight from perth to sydney its over 4 hour flight and they didnt even provide us with a snack for free i strongly believe they should provide passengers a meal on this long flight especially when you are over charging i will definitely be giving business to qantas who provide free meals on the longer flights in australia
22944,xiamen airlines,1,airline is the biggest scam,los angeles to bangkok via xiamen this airline is the biggest scam i booked a flight from los angeles to bangkok with three hours layover in xiamen city at the airport i was told that i cant use xiamen airlines because i dont have chinese transit visa xiamen airport does not have transit area for transit passengers so everyone has to go through customs get out of the airport and then walk back in to check in for the next flight be advised you cant get out of the airport unless you have chinese visa i have never heard that you need to get a transit visa for couple of hours layover i was told to cancel my round trip with xiamen airlines and get a refund after 67 hrs of phone calls with the airline i was issued 15 refund of the total cost the agent explained that somehow my outbound ticket was activated i flew with a different airline but they still activated my ticket and the activated ticket was 85 of the cost and im only getting 15 refund for the return flight dont be fulled by this airlines there is a reason they offer cheaper prices they will streal your money and you will end up paying double
23091,yemenia,6,yemenia customer review,beirut to sanaa on a330 yemenia offers a first and economy class no business odd concept as the first class hardly lives up to expectations pretake off juice offered this is a dry airline and a passable dinner with a choice of three dishes presented on a trolley limited ife mostly in arabic but not a problem for this 3 hrs flight took off and landed more or less on time and the ticket price was good usual scramble at sanaa airport
1080,air berlin,7,would use this carrier again,flew air berlin as a coshare with etihad out of abu dhabi to berlin slightly delayed departure time ab seat configuration 2 x 4 x 2 with seats 43hk noticeably down grade on this aircraft from the a380 more dated appearance and fitout but well maintained and clean seat spacing reduced and generally more cramped feel seat not particularly great or comfortable but bearable for 7hr flight would not like to do any longer plane was close to capacity flight was up to usual german expectations for efficiency and service ive noticed some general poor reviews for ab but not reflective of our experience several longshort haul the service onboard was very good and the food quality slightly better than the etihad offerings also noted 2 x meal services on 7 hr flight which was the same as etihad for 14hr flight cabin amenities well maintained in clean condition throughout the flight on board entertainment below other offerings and screen size a little on the small side to the more modern offerings but screen quality still good overall trip into tegal was smooth and hassle free still love tegal for its compactness and convenience to cbd disappointing to note ab no longer provide their welcome to berlin chocolate heart fassbender rauch on departing the plane really looked forward to this little parting treat would recommend and use this carrier again
7572,corendon airlines,8,i think its a good airline,i flew with corendon airlines on february 2022 from nuremberg to fuerteventura i think its a good airline without major disadvantages the staff was friendly i was able to buy good food on the board and everything was more or less good the flight was on time the plane is not new but good i would only recommend to fix all the fans above the passenger on the way back it was not possible to close it but all the rest is good
11162,iberia,6,honors its contract with passengers,overall the airline honors its contract with the passengers the seats are not comfortable and space and room falls short of expectations flight attendants do the necessary to accommodate passenger needs but they will not go out of their way to help you more that the square in which they are trained food is decent hydration also movie menu is good they keep to their schedule
1504,air dolomiti,8,pleasant flight and great meal,catania to munich overall a great flight experience the cabin crew is very attentive and the plane equipped with an excellent entertainment system that can be used with the onboard wifi on your smartphone all included in the ticket price pleasant flight and great meal
9746,flydubai,2,flydubai customer review,booked multi stop flights through an online search engine small notification stated that ktm dxb operated by fly dubai late take off which is normal from kathmandu service started and noticed the trolley was moving rather quickly through the cabin then i realised they were charging people for food and drink no inflight entertainment either and seats were uncomfortable online check in was hopeless no option to select a seat on 1 leg of return journey or to select veg meal emirates are a decent airline but low cost carriers shouldnt operate these flights if they cant provide at least a drink of water and a snack
5360,bangkok airways,5,flight was delayed by 2 hours,singapore to ko samui staff service and quality of food have never been an issue for me so this review doesnt reflect those my main grumble is the fact that the flight was delayed by 2 hours so this experience bangkok air is a negative one weather is not an issue according to the forecast so what excuse will you give us this time as a resident of samui i expect bettertime to reflect on what you are charging and providing for the ticket price
23118,yeti airlines,8,i would fly this airline again,pokhara to kathmandu i received very good service by yeti airlines at pokhara and kathmandu airport on 1st dec 2018 due to fog my flight was delayed i had a connecting flight to delhi from kathmandu to delhi at 1445 the staff at pokhara airport were very helpful to my request to advance my booking to an earlier flight and ensured my luggage was loaded in the cabin itself so that i could get it first when i landed at kathmandu at kathmandu the staff unloaded my luggage and took me in the small van to the terminal so i could leave the airport quickly i would rate this as excellent service on my next trek in nepal i would fly this airline again
23078,xl airways france,6,xl airways france customer review,my son and i have flown twice on xl mainly because we are on a budget to get to paris the seats are tiny and often the crew forget to translate what is being said into english the crew in the cabin are good considering the long flights the meals are horrible i recommend eating in the airport prior to boarding if you dont mind getting up and going to find the crew yes there is enough water i recommend you bring a big bottle the first time we flew the toilets backed up the second time no problems movies were in french only on 1st flight that was fixed on the second flight overall you get what you pay for so i will fly them again
14108,lufthansa,7,staff acted a bit uncoordinated,the checkin was a bit hesitant since the staff acted a bit uncoordinated and the staff were not well presorted by boarding numbers especially in a destination with a lot of older travelers not really well organized and prepared the flight and the aircraft used were in excellent condition and there were no complaints
20375,thomas cook airlines,5,extremely disappointed,zakynthos to newcastle outbound to zakynthos couldnt be faulted however on the route back we were delayed by 23 hours and not given any information for the majority of the 23 hours we slept on an airport floor for 10 hours with little money and food and the airport didnt offer a lot of food we arrived at the airport at 3am and werent put in accommodation or food until 4pm we then didnt get into an accommodation to sleep in till 8pm after being told we would be leaving at 6pm due to the delay we were told we would be given 400 compensation within 28 days it is now 56 days later and none of my party have received this compensation even after multiple phone calls to thomas cook extremely disappointed with this service
5806,blue1,4,blue1 customer review,lhrhel return aircraft an ex sas md90 aircraft and cabin interior was clean and tidy although a little dated seat pitch was good flight attendants friendly and information from the flight crew was good only tea coffee is free on board food has to be purchased flight to hel was on time return to lhr was one hour late overall no major complaints and good value for money usual good scandinavian hospitality
17115,royal jordanian airlines,2,staff at checkin would not let him board,my son and i took pcr tests on thursday afternoon for a saturday flight to dubai from chicago his negative pcr result lacked a time of day mine did not the rj staff at checkin would not let him board despite the fact that this test would have been within 72 hours no matter what time the test was taken on thursday we were offered no compensation nor any explanation where the rj or uae rules require a time of day stamp on the pcr test he was unable to come and we lost a few thousand dollars in a series of flights and other ticketed activities
14654,meridiana,2,not an airline i can recommend,i have flown with meridiana operated by air italy from milan to mauritius and back before the flight i tried several times to contact their call center to make a seat reservation their own call center told me several times that the flight is made by air italy and that they cannot reserve a seat in such case this is a lie they are the same company air italy is a subsidiary of meridiana and after several months of calling there i was able to make a seat reservation second impression i had was at my seat in the plane i couldnt believe that the right armrest of the seat is broken and taped up service during the flight was at beginning and before landing 015 dcl of water juice etc for a 11 hours flight a great deal they served also something what they call dinner i tried it taste was terrible service has been all the time very reserved without a indication of a smile or interest of passenger other thing is how they are dealing with the seat reservations shortly before the flight and onboard they have tried to change my paid seat to another but they didnt have any aisle seat available so i disagreed later on board i could see a big chaos because more than 20 people have had the same seats assigned this was probably caused by the fact that 80 have got the seat on madagaskar and the rest on mauritius plane was going through madagaskar to mauritius and in 2 hours back also thanks to this chaos we arrived back in milan with more than 1 hour delay overall not an airline i can recommend
22912,xiamen airlines,9,outstanding value for money,bangkok to los angeles via xiamen return everything was great checkin at suvarnabhumi airport was smooth and the flight from bangkok to xiamen was ontime and they served a tasty meal we noticed how friendly the cabin crew were r only downside about the 737 from bangkok is that theres no personal tv screen at xiamen airport for our 18hour layover immigration process was smooth we were eligible for a free transit visa we received a free accommodation voucher by xiamen air the hotel we were given was the airlines own xiamen air hotel in the heart of xiamen the room had two double beds and included a chinese buffet breakfast too xiamen to los angeles on boeing 7879 was better great onboard entertainment with plenty of hollywood movies to choose from we were served 3 meals and a snack on the 12hour journey to lax i applied for their free wifi in advance only 50 spots per flight which worked well you only get 3hours but it was free one thing that surprised me was the english proficiency of their crew an added bonus was the opportunity to visit the lovely chinese coastal city of xiamen the price we paid for our return journey from bkk to lax was almost half the price of a return ticket from bkk to syd at the time of our departure outstanding value for money
8135,dragonair,6,dragonair customer review,i travelled economy from bangalore to hong kong on christmas eve the flight was an a330300 departing blr at 3 am i found the seats a little uncomfortable especially because im above average height they were really hard to sleep on and i hardly slept a wink throughout the flight most of the crew were extremely professional moving quickly and efficiently throughout meal service except a few who seemed a little uptight the meal was decent they had pralines as an extra touch for christmas and i thought this was a nice addition i also found their ife system studio ka similar to cathays studio cx to be really good they had a wide range of programmes with recent movies and music the baggage claim was smooth with no problems overall the flight is okay to travel to hkg but it would be convenient if cathay took over considering it is a night flight of 5 and a half hours
7085,china southern airlines,9,kept inquiring about relevant information,our flight departed at 1230 in the evening on june 29 2021 we need to provide a valid pcr test report for 48 hours before boarding when we arrived at the airport to check in we were told that our test report might not meet new zealands entry requirements we were very frustrated fortunately staff from china southern airlines kept inquiring about relevant information for us finally with the help of staff we took the flight back to new zealand on time thank you for your quick accurate professional and solving problems for us
20527,tianjin airlines,9,tianjin airlines customer review,never heard of this airline until i flew in july on embraer 190 from tianjin to ningbo but impressed by service standards at the airport the check in and boarding was quick and efficient and fas were very attentive okay their english language skills need improving but never seen such an efficient and smiling set of fas seats comfortable for this quite short trip meals was also good lack of newspapers though will fly them again in september and would have no doubts about recommending them to others as a musttry airline
11332,icelandair,4,wouldnt select carrier again,fairly satisfactory east bound but delayed going out from zurich meal payment for first leg was put on second leg arrived late into iceland chaotic airport with numerous delays seat configuration changed to a 757 with more seats and i was put onto a mid seat sub par food aircraft full and air stagnant seats narrow and hard entertainment very limited overall wouldnt select carrier again
19313,sunwing airlines,6,plane was clean in both flights,flew yyzcun and cunyyz with sunwing as a part of a work trip the aircraft was a 16 year old boeing 737 for both flights oktvy yyzcun couldnt check in online so had to wait in line for around 45 minutes at yyz i was asked whether i wanted an aisle or a window seat boarding was fine pushback was around 15 minutes late but we landed on time we were served teacoffee twice during the 4 hour flight not too much legroom but not bad cunyyz also couldnt check in online waited for around 1 hour at cun i wasnt asked this time if i wanted an aisle or a window seat and i was randomly given 32e last row middle seat pushed back on time landed a couple of minutes early was served teacoffee twice during the 3 hour 20 minute flight my seat obviously didnt recline but the legroom was enough plane was clean in both flights
14034,lot polish airlines,3,had a very unpleasant trip,ive been travelling for the first time with lot polish airlines and i had a very unpleasant trip one of the flight attendants was very rude for no reason ive been in the flight with my toddler who is 2 years old and he was a very good boy all the flight sleeping ive been going to ask nice for some water so i can add in to the baby bottle and she looks very disturbed and just pointed me where the water was sitting without saying anything or trying to offer to help me after this i was just having my shoulder a little out of the chair and she came and screamed at me in polish i looked at her and i said sorry i dont speak polish what is happening and she started to yell at me oh of course you speak english i remember all i answered her back was to tell you can ask me nice not screaming or being mad
7805,csa czech airlines,2,operated by smartwings,barcelona to prague i bought ticket with czech airlines but the flight was operated by smartwings one of the worst airlines their boeings does not have much space for legs build for low cost company with this configuration
3050,air transat,3,options plus is not not worth one dime,paying for options plus is a scam you supposedly changed the rules of what you receive as a plus in toronto i was registering in economy and not options plus as no one was there for a flight that was leaving for 9am i was told to go to gate c2 for boarding my partner and i sat there for 2 hours and no one said that the gate was changed luckily we started to notice no one at our gate and checked the screen oh yes gate got changed there was no announcement what i am most shocked about is that on top of the fee that i was charged options plus i still had to pay another fee for seat selection in the past everything was included under options plus so im in the plane now and then find out that you dont get a meal with options plus or any of the other amenities any longer well let me tell you for the fee that you charged me for options plus is not not worth one dime now im in punta cana coming home and again it didnt matter if i was under options plus i could have been in the lineup for economy so the only benefit i found when you pay for options plus is that you get your baggage first thats it in total for 2 ppl 31600 was charged i have been flying with air transat since about 20082009 and this is now the last time in addition while staying at the bahia principe in punta cana and 3 days before we were returning to canada we could not locate the air transat rep to find out when the bus was picking us up for the airport all the other airline reps were there everyday except her representing air transat when she did finally show up she was rude that we were making her accountable for not being around then in speaking with the other ppl taking the same flight as us they had made comments that they couldnt find air transat rep at the same resort we were at anyway it is my fault for not checking that the amenities that were included under options plus no longer exists and i feel that i got so ripped off
22182,vivaaerobs,1,i am not at all impressed,as a travel agent i enjoy testing different airlines this is my first experience with viva aerobus and i have to say i am not at all impressed my flight houston to huatulco was changed by the airline to a flight it isnt even possible for me to make as i wont even land in houston until 3pm new flight at 10am after 3 customer service calls i ended up getting a voucher it wont be available to use for 3 days they could not rebook me houston monterrey huatulco even though there are flights available the usa customer service line does not work i had to call the mexico customer service line yes there is an english option they would not issue a refund even though this is a change they did they would only issue a voucher agent 2 said the voucher is good for a year agent 3 said the voucher is good for 120 days now i have to wait 3 days to use the voucher to do the houston to monterrey to huatulco
6445,caribbean airlines,9,attendants very accommodating,trinidad to new york return check in was quick with the flight leaving on time the cabin attendants were very accommodating food was very tasty the return trip was also excellent dinner onboard was excellent i recommend anyone to try caribbean airlines
17916,shanghai airlines,8,shanghai airlines customer review,tianjin to shanghai hongqi the flight and service itself was comparable to an australian domestic flight but what really impressed me was the effort and communication provided by the captain given the excessive delays that appear to be common place around beijing airspace
11601,iran air,9,a wonderful flight,a wonderful flight from tehran to paris with new a330 that was very modern good entertainment system but only a small number of film and music choices but a very good flight map the aircraft was very clean two meals were served first a very good breakfast and a snack later
16739,regional express,5,regional express customer review,melbourne to albury and return great flights both ways very comfortable middle sized twin turboprop saab 340 seating 11 rows of 12 pax leather seats very comfortable and mounted quite high giving you lots of legstretching room wide too compared to airbus a320 pleasant fas each time adequate snacks available only downside is that the taxes and fees more than double the cost of the fare so the choice between using this shorthaul route and hiring a car and just driving there is closer than it looks on first quote highly recommend rex if you dont mind flying in smaller aircraft than 737s or a320s
20809,transaero airlines,7,transaero airlines customer review,jfk to dme then to kazan overall the flight was enjoyable the food was much better than we received before from aeroflot the crew was nice and spoke mostly russian but did try to speak english on our way back from kazan to moscow dme they wanted to charge us extra for our baggage my wife tried to explain to them that this only one leg of an international flight to new york jfk after a while they waived the extra baggage weight fees overall i would rate transaero about a 7 out of a 10 we did have a 20 hour layover in moscow dme because not enough flights to america
14400,malawian airlines,1,never recommend this airline,johannesburg to blantyre they overbooked the flight still checked us in then made us wait almost 8 hours standing around the ticketing office with absolutely incompetent staff no one knew what was going on nor could assist us on top of that they have also lost our bags i could never recommend this airline to anyone to travel ever use another airline
7321,comair,7,a really nice experience,cape town to port elizabeth via johannesburg first time using comair domestically in south africa marketed as british airways check in at cpt quick and easy using my ba frequent flier status i was offered lounge access at the slow lounge which i must say is pretty good flight boarded on time a new boeing 737800 crew very polite and seating good with space a snack served on the 1 hr 50 min flight bags off quickly on landing jnbplz check in again very quick and polite again offered the use of the slow lounge which is one of the best ive been in boarding on to a pretty old 737400 not full so lots of room the aircraft kept clean and looked in good shape a small hot meal offered by a nice crew departed and arrived on time a really nice experience on both flights
18178,silver airways,1,total scam in my opinion,charleston to st petersburg total scam in my opinion we just spent over three hours on hold with them today because we couldnt transact via their website the help window on the site referred us to their call center however no one answers the phone there for hours this isnt the first time this has happened to us but it will be the last we have other flights booked in december and ill be switching to another airline and they delay flights which is why we had to cancel theyre not like the big guys they admitted to us that they didnt know why the flight was delayed or if it would even take off today therefore we had to cancel all the legs today and tomorrow our entire family vacation airfare just cost us double we had to rebook in order to guarantee making it to the cruise on time tomorrow morning and oh yeah no luggage refunds either even though this is all their fault and it cost us 50 cancel fee per ticket basically 100 bucks per ticket never again with these guys cant believe theyre still in business
21601,uzbekistan airways,5,uzbekistan airways customer review,tashkent to nukus domestic was scared to board the old tu 154 seemed to be patched up on the outside no one seems to acknowledge seat allocation and i think i caused an onboard fight by making this woman move from my seat who yelled at me and then the woman in her seat who took it out on the person in her seat and so on but they did move wasnt that cheap considering the plane we were in couldnt relax until we arrived had some peanuts and flavoured water served to us seats folded down forwards when we got off the plane security guards in the baggage collection area checking our tickets when we collected our bags still it beats the 14 hours train ride when youre on a tight schedule
15701,openskies,8,openskies customer review,oryiad first time on openskies good value business class with flat bed and business experience food amenities lounge etc but in a small aircraft this means cabin with more privacy and rapid boarding luggage delivery since openskiesis british airways subsidiary you can rely on british airways ground facilities and shared frequent flyer programme the b757 plane is retrofitted with former ba business seats somewhat old but acceptable entertainment system more privacy than air france food was good on this flight and by far better than british airways crew ok and more interaction in such cabin operating from orly also an advantage connecting from other countries is pretty smooth with orly connected to rer through main paris railway stations
8596,el al israel airlines,5,seats were not comfortable,tel aviv to vienna both flights were delayed only on our return flight an excuse and explanation was given both flights were oversold and especially in tlv they even tried to seperate groups which is in my opinion an absolute nogo the planes did not look very inviting cleaning was certainly reduced to a minimum crew was quite nice on the flight to tlv experienced and mature crew members but on the flight back there was not even a hint of a smile young ones but certainly with no motivation service was quite surprising somehow i thought on a 35 hours flight there would be offered a bar service or at least a possibility to purchase drinks but they only distributed mediumsize water bottles and an overheated sandwich which had no taste at all seats were not comfortable at all i assume for the chaos at the airport in tlv el al is not really responsible but the checkin area looked and felt extremely disorganized really feel sorry for those people who have to use it frequently
6109,british airways,9,i enjoyed my flight,i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only one downside when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t5 so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes i believe the heathrow t5 were having strike action that week
628,africa world airlines,6,call centre is so shocking,tamale to accra good onboard service juice snack and a meat pastry thing that let it down was pre flight experience their online card payment system for the flight never works it charged me twice for my flight and their customer service call centre is so shocking that after one month of trying they didnt refund had to do a charge back through my card they then cancelled my booking although i had still paid they didnt tell me they had cancelled it i luckily checked my booking 2 hours before the flight
18811,southwest airlines,6,eyeopening and frustrating,my wife and i have been traveling on southwest for nearly three decades and generally appreciate their service or that they do their best to be helpful when travel plans go sideways in fact we just had a trip through southwest vacations that was fantastic our latest experience with them however has been both eyeopening and frustrating we had booked flights for february 2nd from puerto vallarta to reno with a connection in phoenix we had flight 1299 from puerto vallarta to phoenix and then flight 547 from phoenix to reno we received an email from southwest notifying us that our flights were changed from puerto vallarta to denver and then denver to reno we had seen this denver connection when we were initially booking our trip however we did not want to fly from mexico to denver in the dead of the winter too much of a chance of being stuck in mexico i went on the southwest website and could see that our original flights through phoenix and on to reno were still there and they were still selling tickets for these flights i called southwest customer service and asked that our flights be changed back to our original flights the customer service representative changed us back to the original 1299 flight puerto vallarta to phoenix but informed us heres where things got wonky that we could no longer choose our original phoenix to reno flight 547 because the two flights were no longer linked in their system i asked her what she meant by that apparently southwest links certain flights together so when you search for a flight from a to b with a connection in between it will only show you these linked flights there may be other connecting flights that are departing earlier or later depending on your needs but you will not see them because they are not linked flights in their system so our original flights were linked when we booked them but were then unlinked and changed by southwest to denver and when i tried to change them back i was told that is no longer an option because those two flights are no longer linked the only linked flight through phoenix was a 5hour and 20 minute layover in phoenix and then a flight stopping in vegas and traveling on to reno i pointed out to southwest that there was an earlier flight 867 through vegas and on to reno with only a 2 hour and 10 minute layover i was told that was not an option because that was not a linked flight seriously you changed our flights you unlinked our original flights and refuse to do anything to restore our original flights or alleviate the lengthy delay you left us with cmon southwest you can do better at the end of most flights the flight attendant will say we know you have a choice in flying and we thank you for flying southwest and so my wife and i will spend our 5 hour and 20 minute layover contemplating our future travel plans and considering if its time to exercise that choice
5292,bamboo airways,4,staff on board were pleasant but extremely untrained and disorganised,disorganised poorly trained staff tiny portions of food check in at hanoi staff member at check in desk was uninterested sending messages on his phone the whole time he was serving me didnt ask security questions didnt give me a chance to explain that the contents of my luggage were fragile and didnt even offer a choice of seat food only 2 very very small meals on a 13 hour flight no vegetarian option no options to choose meal before flight portions were small so an hour after eating i was starving i weigh 50kg and do not eat much other passengers felt the same and staff made pot noodles when requested so most the flight was engulfed in that nasty pot noodle smell dinner was served unannounced an hour and a half after take off and then nothing until breakfast an hour and a half before landing service staff on board were pleasant but extremely untrained and disorganised they asked a few passengers to put phones away for take off but rule seemed to be arbitrarily applied same with seats in upright position half the cabin got offered eye shades the other half didnt some passengers were clearly drunk and kept calling cabin crew who succumbed to their every demand at the expense and discomfort of other passengers a circusjoke luggage items in my suitcase were damaged on arrival positives new aircraft
20760,titan airways,3,uncomfortable seats,gatwick to alicante booked as british airways and operated by titan airways horrible service i had booked through ba so was surprised to see a titan aircraft an old aircraft uncomfortable seats and rude abrupt crew definitely do not want another repeat experience
2407,air namibia,1,excellent from start to finish,we travelled on air namibia after our travel company arranged substitute flights to victoria falls due to our virgin atlantic plane being delayed from london resulting in us missing our connection virgin were very unhelpful offering a new flight 2 days later the trip with air namibia was excellent from start to finish the crew were very friendly on board the food was nice when we landed at windhoek the ground staff were very helpful ensuring our bags continued the journey and we were kept informed

15610,onur air,7,onur air customer review,doncaster to dalaman return flights on time both ways legroom was adequate staff were fine all in all much better than anticipated
19076,srilankan airlines,6,a comfortable cost effective journey,flew london to sydney via colombo there is a long wait in colombo however srilankan put me up in a pretty decent hotel right on the beach to wait out my 12 hours if you want a hotel you have to book it through reservations and once its done its a pretty straight forward process when you arrive in colombo so far as the flights a330300 has the herringbone layout with lay flat beds which were quite comfortable and i managed a good sleep on both legs inflight service wasnt outstanding was a bit hit and miss but was ok ife wasnt outstanding but had a reasonable selection of movies and tv shows sufficient for the journey overall although not high frills if you want a comfortable cost effective journey in a pretty reasonable business class give sri lankan a go i will fly with them again
5167,ba cityflyer,9,superior service to ba,edinburgh to london city and first time flying ba city flyer and enjoyed the service check in quick and polite security busy but quick too i had an hour in the galleries lounge which was okay for a coffee boarding via a8 and steps on to a nice looking clean e170 seat 1a very nice crew pretty chatty and funny actually departed on time one airborne a coffee and snack offered which apparantly ba proper can no longer afford on the edilhr service its my first time on ba cityflyer my first time on this type of aircraft and my first use of london city landed a few minutes early bags off quickly a great service i find bas franchises or subsidiary operated services such as comair in south africa or ba cityflyer normally operate a superior service to ba
21853,virgin australia,6,it was a pleasant flight,due to a departure delay with my sydney to melbourne flight this flight was delayed too nevertheless it was a pleasant flight staff were friendly and efficient and i did not have to wait long to collect my baggage
15254,norwegian,2,matter related to coronavirus,no meaningful customer service no reasonable accommodations for matter related to coronavirus took hours to get anyone on phone hung up on rather than connected 4 times agent knew nothing website unclear this is a discount operation in every meaningful way related to interfacing with the airline
14675,meridiana,7,would fly meridiana again,although meridiana is very basic we had great experiences flying new york jfk to naples and back a few weeks ago check in was quick and efficient at both airports and they let me check my somewhat large although within allowance carryon free of charge both ways the seats though are tiny im 510 and my boyfriend is 61 and if we had known we would have paid extra for the comfort seats with extra legroom for a long flight to italy this was not ideal but i should have done my homework so i cant blame the airline the plane was a boeing 767 both ways and was old and sort of dirty but quiet and it was a smooth flight both ways the food was fine on the way into naples but on the way home it was atrocious the flight crew is totally uninvolved and stays at the back of the plane for the duration of the flight but when they did come around for meals and beverages they were pleasant enough the movies were corny romantic comedies but dealable all in all i got what i paid for a 600 round trip ticket to italy is not something im going to complain about the trip there was better than the trip home but i would fly meridiana again in the future for the value alone
8668,emirates,8,lets see if the consistency improves,what a difference a crew makes flight from dubai was staffed by a really engaging crew for whom nothing was too much trouble seat was comfortable but you can tell this was one of the older a380 as part were looking a bit worse for wear food on this flight was among some of the best i have ever had lounge was busy but to be fair we sat close to the gate and didnt venture in boarding was separate to economy however we still had to wait 10 min even though when we tried it was already 10 min past the boarding time got the two return legs to go lets see if the consistency improves
8077,dragonair,6,would recommend dragonair,hong kong to shanghai flight was initially delayed from 1200 to 1340 but then we boarded around 1325 and sat on the aircraft not getting airborne until 1600 this was due to bad weather in shanghai although probably more likely the usual chinese air force airspace delays along this route which i am given to understand are almost constant i accept this is no fault of the airline however it might have been better to let us sit in the terminal rather than on the aircraft for so long they gave us our meals on the ground these were good the flight was good friendly staff dealing with loud and frustrated passengers well and spoke good english the seat was comfortable check in and ground staff were friendly and the aircraft was clean return flight to hong kong was cancelled this again due to bad weatherchinese airspace problems with every airline so not dragonair fault however two queues to ticket desk both massive when we arrived were for different things no one told us which queue to stand in so we split up and stood one in each eventually got a standby number came back 2 hours later and was put on a new flight this flight left very soon so were given priority security and baggage tags missed our connection in hkg but staff helped us get accommodation and a new flight in hkg staff at shanghai were slow didnt tell us which queue to be in or what was going on however check in clerk was helpful again not dragonair fault but couldve been handled much better 4 hours of queuing and then a sprint to security not fun flight itself was on a330 clean and had ife meals were good so were crew seats slightly dated but fine and aircraft clean would recommend dragonair they are a good airline and delays not their fault just staff in shanghai need more training at how to deal with this especially as it happens frequently they are excellent though when it comes to reorganising in hong kong and as sister airline to cathay pacific make connections to them as seamless and worry free as possible as you can make it all international flight and domestic flight connecting under one booking they will sort hotels and new flights if you miss connection so would recommend dragonair especially if you are doing international flight followed by domestic flights within china
8775,ernest airlines,1,cheap food prices,milan bergamo to tirana lot of comfort reclining seat big leg space cheap food prices on board cabin crew very professional flight on time
2911,air tahiti nui,4,cabin staff appeared only moderately trained,flew papeete to auckland with air tahiti nui the original plane we were to take had mechanical problems so we waited for 3 hours for another plane it appeared that there was quite a bit of confusion with this and whilst waiting we noticed the very slow boarding and taking off process of other planes when it came our turn whilst all were on board it still took over a half an hour to count and recount passengers the food on both flights to and from papeete was substandard and in two cases inedible the cabin staff appeared only moderately trained and made me wonder how they would perform if there was a problem tahiti and the surrounding islands and its people are wonderful on a return trip i would select another airline on arrival at auckland airport it took three hours to organise our accomodation due to missed connections
19733,tam airlines,5,tam airlines customer review,someone had mention in reviews that it was too cold during the flight well it should be an advantage our flight from london to sao paulo was a nightmare due to lack of air conditioning on i prefer to wrap in blankets and extra clothes rather than not having any air at all we asked staff several times to turn it on but nothing happened staff were very friendly though good entertainment panel
3034,air transat,1,unbelievably poor customer experience,air transat provides an unbelievably poor customer experience my flight was delayed by 3hr in gatwick resulting a missed connection and loss of baggage furthermore the check in staff at gatwick were aware i would miss my flight and were unable to rebook my itinerary really poor customer experience furthermore following the loss of my baggage the airline handed my luggage to a really poor no name courier firm at toronto who are seemingly unable to communicate again any other airline would use a reputable firm such as ups fedex or dhl finally the a321 provides a really poor experience flying transatlantic in total you are best spending your money on a full service airline such as british airways or lufthansa

4689,asky airlines,3,the worst experience,while in transit from lome to abuja on the 10th september we boarded the flight as one of the last passengers and traveling as a family we got a bad vibe from a particular staff on the flight that same staff and another staff due to the staff them not focusing on the job at hand she accused us of stealing a mug from the airline and she started causing drama saying all sorts of things in french which we could not understand we asked her to verify but she would not and just went on talking trash this is the worst experience i have ever had while traveling and after my return i hope to never fly with asky again unless an action is taken towards the behavior of their staff

17440,sa express,4,sa express customer review,jnb to richards bay return flight on friday 28 sep 12 flight was delayed by almost 30 min no reason given bad weather when we arrived at richards bay and after two attempts to land was diverted to dur landed safely in dur with the option of flying back to jnb and then out to richards bay the next day or we could travel back to richards bay at our own cost i was fortunate to get a vehicle after waiting an hour for one and travelled back at my own cost pity it is the only operator between jnb and richards bay
18445,sky express airlines,7,sky express airlines customer review,limnoslesvos on a bae jetstream a quick and friendly checkin no seats were allocated for this short flight we were bussed the 50 metres to the plane which took about a minute across an empty tarmac the seats were comfortable enough given the length of the flight though the aircraft interior looked quite worn the single crew member served a boiled sweet and a cold drink the flight operated on schedule
10305,georgian airways,3,strive mightily to avoid them,gatwick to tbilisi i purchases tickets in august for a november flight we were arriving from the us to gatwick and were to connect same day from gatwick to tbilisi georgian air decided sometime september october to change to a fall schedule which did not include a monday flight to tbilisi georgian air never emailed or called we learned approximately 3 weeks prior to our late november flight that we would be arriving in london on a monday but could not connect to tbilisi until wednesday georgian air never 1 attempted to place us on another carrier for same monday 2 offered a partial or full reimbursement for the flight or expenses or inconveniencenor 3 apologized at all georgian air placed me on the wed flight and said all is fine your flight is good for wed this cost me 2 hotel nights in london not cheap plus train tickets tofrom gatwick to hotel plus food for 2 days and we missed the business meeting that we were flying to anyway for a 5 hr flight they rattle around for the first 2 hrs then wake you more than an hour prior to landing for no apparent reason so dont plan on getting to sleep any significant amount the crew is friendly and seem very competent but the airline is apparently disorganized and has no idea how to compensate clients when they cost them unbudgeted funds i may have no options but this airline in the future but i will strive mightily to avoid them
20385,thomas cook airlines,6,thomas cook passed the buck,gatwick to orlando this is what checkin at gatwick airport looked like on wednesday july 19 hundreds of passengers in the queue one person at the counter we arrived early at 830 for an 1100 flight we waited almost 2 hours to checkin therefore we had to rush through the airport to make our flight bypassing any purchases we intended to make including food and dutyfree items and bathrooms we intended to visit was an explanation given only the comment that the checkin desk employees are not thomas cook employees so thomas cook airlines took no responsibility yes we were told that with the thomas cook airline banner over every desk thomas cook airlines passed the buck were any courtesies offered like a complementary beverage on the plane no a beautiful firsttime holiday in london capped off by an atrocious reception on our departure with all the competition for the travel dollar to great britain i would hope that thomas cook airlines improves and starts placing customer service highest of their priorities
18110,silkair,6,seats give adequate legroom,the silkair flight from singapore to hanoi was enjoyable however the distribution of meals was rather slow and unprofessional of the cabin crew the seats give adequate legroom but lack ptvs and there were only small dropdown screens from above the landing was really smooth though
4496,arik air,2,shabby and unprofessional,our arik air flight from lagos to london was originally supposed to depart at 1255 after checking in we we told that there would be a delay of about an hour just after about an hour and a few minutes a lady came to update us telling us that there would be further delays and she didnt really know when we would be leaving there was a lot of commotion and anger from the passengers at which she promised to do her best and while we waited we would be offered some refreshment which never came about 30 mins later we were told we could board the plane we were quite bemused as we all knew that they only boarded us that quickly to get out of the promise to give us refreshments as they should have we all settled into our seats and sat there for another 15hrs with no explanations from anyone as to why there was still a delay passengers became agitated angry and very upset we eventually left lagos at 4pm and got to london around 9pm the treatment of passengers on the flight was shabby and unprofessional to say the least and i will never recommend ark to anyone
15908,peruvian airlines,5,you get what you pay for,la paz to lima via cuzco its ironic that their slogan is punctuality is our thing while the only thing they can never get right is being on time so if you have a connection flight that same day avoid this airline in my case the flight was delayed only 1 hour so my connection with copa scheduled 6 hours after the scheduled arrival went without problems but as a regular user of la paz airport i have seen flights delayed up to 6 hourswich makes me a lucky man the planes are quite old and doesnt look much taken care of and the leg room is the smallest i have ever seen and that includes regional jets their staff are ok as long as you speak spanishwich can cause problems in the stop in cuzco and their crazy costums and inmigration proceedings and the onboard service is ok taking count the trips are just an hour long each leg maybe is a case of you get what you pay for as their fares are most of the time much cheaper than latam or avianca
911,air astana,5,they let me down real bad,astana to paris in general air astana offers decent service quality acceptable food entertainment on the board along with fairly new aircraft despite quite often being disproportionately expensive i flew many times with them and never had problems until two days ago when they let me down real bad when in the beginning of january they started offering promotion flights to several destination in march for their loyalty card holders me and my sister decided to take advantage of it and planned our trip to paris during nauryz 3 day national holiday in kazakhstan in advance however on monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 2103 to 2303 due to spring flight schedule corrections thus completely eliminating any chance of using these holidays for a trip these types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed before offering promotions on the dates upon contacting their cs they declined to change flights or to compensate internal tickets im deeply disappointed however considering their near monopoly status in kazakhstan i fear i cannot boycott them that easily shame on you air astana for scamming your frequent fliers
2975,air tahiti nui,3,air tahiti nui customer review,once on the plane it was great but ground team was horrible and inept we boarded at lax for cdg and were amazed at the lack of urgency or customer concern as the plane sat empty and the gate agent sat talking on her cell phone we all looked on amazed 45 minutes after we were scheduled to board she announced we would be boarding 15 minutes late due to the plane arriving late although it had been parked at the gate for hours as we waited clearly she had not looked at a clock this caused us to depart over an hour late unfortunately we were on this trip during the iceland volcano eruption air tahiti once again proved how little they cared i called the airlines 3 times about a flight only to be hung up on by the attendent once we had a flight we were told to be at the airport 4 hours ahead of time due to the challenge from the volcano we arrived 4 hours early but the agents did not we all 350 of us waited in line when they did show up it took them 45 minutes to get ready have coffee chat laugh joke and enjoy themselves all in front of us without any communication with us zero urgency or concern for all of us who had been waiting days to get on a plane once ticketed we went to the gate plane was there flight crew was there but not gate agents for hours we waited until they showed up and even longer while they organized themselves it was like a circus show watching them the whole ordeal was so ridiculous and unnecessary the ground team has no care or concern or urgency for the passenger i will never fly this airline again they didnt earn any stars with us
12111,jet2com,5,there are some good aspects,birmingham to palma there are some good aspects to this airline their check in is well staffed and staff usually pleasant the aircraft are standard 737s but have large overhead lockers we normally select extra legroom seats but on this occasion finished up in the centre of the aircraft as we booked a little late the seats are hard and non reclining and how anyone finds them ok i dont know they are typical low cost airline our flight was marred by a male stag party who were obnoxious throughout they were not well dealt with by the cabin staff who are admittedly in a difficult situation they were happily not present on the return leg one issue bemuses me i am aware of the red colour used in the airlines corporate logo but i can see no convincing reason why that should be echoed in the internal lighting its an airliner not a sex shop
9623,flair airlines,2,the customer service is awful,my luggage was lost for 4 days no communication from airlines in spite of numerous emails finally got the damaged bag and have had nothing but 2 to 3 months of automated replies asking for forms that they have already acknowledged receiving in previous emails and nothing else the customer service is awful
20003,thai airasia,7,thai airasia customer review,fd 3112 outgoing flight delayed for over 45 minutes without prior notice only display 20 minutes delay on screen before scheduled departure time aircraft clean enough but looked old with wear and tear seat tight and not so comfortable fd 3111 return flight boarded punctually but delayed with passengers carry on problem seemed as though everybody could bring on what they wanted their policy is not enforced whatsoever and that is very problematic cabin crew are polite efficient and try their best food sold on board was fairly priced generally a fair experience and acceptable standard
16804,rex airlines,1,the best customer service,rex airlines is super warm and friendly felt treated like a vip staff helping you when you arrive at the airport you will be approached by a real human rather than a cold machine in melbourne on the 29 march the staff member was ready to help the best customer service checked my suitcase in for me and told me where to go every step of the way great for a first time traveller with rex very impressed cabin clean tidy and covid safe great experience with rex will travel with them again
1064,air berlin,1,helpful friendly and professional crews,zrh to jfk via dus in c excellent c service and product on both legs as always arrival in jfk 20 minutes ahead of schedule after hundreds of short and longhaul flights in c and f with lh and lx i recently switched to air berlin for transatlantic flights after a satus macht from hon to ab platinum really like the ab business product a lot more 19 c seats only proper lie flat seats and certainly not with cheap air cushions no cheap trolleys coming down the aisle but proper restaurant style service with excellent foods and wines very helpful friendly and professional crews etc last but not least it usually only takes me about 10 minutes from the door of the plane to the taxi stand at jfk terminal 8 wheras it can easily take 2 hours at the other terminals specifically at the international terminal 4 finally ab platinum status oneworld emerald allows for first class lounge access across the entire oneworld network with all oneworld carriers as well as etihad
18227,singapore airlines,7,inflight service was quite nice,i was supposed to fly on sq25 to singapore via frankfurt the flight was canceled after we are at the gate for 4 hours past the departure time without any explanation being flown with sq for many times i suspect this had to do with jfk rather than the airline however they should still bear the responsibility for addressing to their customers we were rebooked to the nonstop sq23 to singapore the following day we ended up on the a350900xlr which was quite nice but i still prefer their a380 due to the flight change we did not get our book the cook meals inflight service was quite nice as expected from sq
8677,emirates,9,a great experience,excellent service i flew dubai bham dubai in economy class emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage initially i was skeptical particularly on the dxbbhx route but emirates made no mistakes this is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge the flight departed on time the crew had a smile and were quite professional food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class there was another snack service followed by juiceshot drinks 15 hours before landing the seating is quite good and has a seat pitch of 32 b777s in use by emirates are getting old and you can see the signs their ice system was excellent i am not sure i would like the business class seats here as they werent lieflat but i was flying economy families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using polaroid cameras the inflight wifi was free for text messaging using whatsapp even in economy if you have skywards membership my only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at terminal 3 in dubai to reach immigration which was a breeze overall it was a great experience but flights are quite expensive compared to the competition
76,adria airways,4,adria airways customer review,fraviefra on crj200 cheapest option when compared to lufthansa and austrian plying this short 15 hour flight small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position larger carryon bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age quite saggy in the squab service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea coffee fas smiling the return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at fra luggage claim was quick
9704,flyadeal,5,prices are quite unreasonably high,flew on a routine domestic service from jeddah to riyadh the aircraft was ok for the 1 hour flight i had paid for meals and water which i never received so im quite disappointed legroom was quite bad and the seat wasnt uncomfortable but i cant complain much for the 1 hr flight i have to say the prices are quite unreasonably high
17199,rwandair,9,my first choice of carrier,gatwick to kigali the best way to get around africa due to the young fleet of planes that is well maintained exceptional staff rwandair is always my first choice of carrier kigali is my favorite stopover city as well i am glad they will be expanding with flights to new york soon
21161,turkish airlines,3,flights could have been better,extra legroom not possible for over 65 we booked a flight from tashkent to heathrow via istanbul 12 july 2023 i am 197m tall and wanted to pay for extra legroom seat in economy during booking on website the seat selection option flagged that those over 65 cannot book exit row its first time ive encountered this having flown on many other airlines where exit row can be occupied by 16 or older and capable of assisting with evacuation having accepted that turkish and some other airlines set a maximum age i searched the seat plan airbus a330300 and selected extra legroom seats by bulkhead row 11 not shown as an exit row all seemed ok when i completed the booking and paid weeks later i completed the online checkin only possible 24 hours or less before flight which showed our extra legroom seat allocation but when printing boarding passes we discovered we had been allocated seats in row 36 the seat pitch is too small for me and most uncomfortable for 5 hour flight even painful when passenger in front reclines there seems to be an unclear or unreliable booking process please be warned if you are over 65 and require extra legroom then dont book turkish airlines or pay more for business class another comment which might help some travelers if you are transiting in istanbul then make sure your next flight leaves you enough time for transfer our flight from tashkent to istanbul landed 20 mins late it then took an unbelievably long 45 mins to taxi a long way around the airport to hardstanding another 10 mins to disembark aircraft it then took us 30 mins walking at a fast pace through transit and bag scan to next boarding gate where passengers had already started boarding the flights themselves could have been better toilets were not cleaned all rubbish not collected left on floor during landing maps would not load on inflight information screen
11147,iberia,3,cramped seats made it uncomfortable,the state of the aircraft being dirty is unacceptable and reflects poorly on maintenance and hygiene standards the cramped seats made it uncomfortable to move or eat without squeezing yourself which is not ideal for a longhaul flight the quality of the food served to me on the flight was disappointing with the breakfast roll being inedible and a lack of choice of juices was also inconvenient the fact that only red wine and beer were available as beverages is surprising and not having any other options is a major letdown
5284,bamboo airways,2,the worst business class experience,this is by far the worst business class experience i have ever had on checking at singapore i was told i can only check in for the first leg of my trip and my bags would not be checked through ok so what happens then they check you in and you are expected to go through immigration pick up your bags and recheck in that would be great if you had a visa i was stopped from going through immigration and told to go to the transit counter at the transit counter i was told we can get your bags but we cant check you in for 7 hours layover was 10 hours so you will have to wait in the immigration hall with no seats no shops just a room with 10 or so immigration desks upon some back and fro with the agent they made a call and said ok ok you only need to wait for 3 hours are you kidding me i did not pay for a selftransfer ticket nor did i pay to stand in a hallway for 3 hours after more time talking with the supervisor i was told we will check you in given a boarding pass i said what about my bags we will come and give you a baggage receipt later enter the lounge stay there for a few hours then told you must leave or pay 45 usd if you want to stay so i paid as i wanted a shower and had 4 hours left on my layover the flight was ok service standard my advice do not use this airline if you are a business traveler vietnam airlines is far better and worth the extra 200 bucks
305,aeroflot russian airlines,2,the whole ticket was cancelled,i missed my flight due to a confusion with the flights in the airport moscow svo when two flights of aeroflot were scheduled to the same destination with a difference of approx 20 minutes but one of them was not shown on the departure board for some unknown reason as a result i missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight when i approached the customer desk in moscow with my issue of a missed flight i still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket they informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled it took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights how about the so called bonus miles program apparently its not even possible to spend them in any way if you havent reached 3000 miles so some of my flights with aeroflot were not even counted in the miles account even though i travel quite often is there a bug not counting the miles even when you enter the frequent flyer number
19095,srilankan airlines,3,have never seen this kind of service,i saw some of the worst customer service delay flights at delhi airport but no apologies food they serve was pathetic and dry especially the hindu meal with no other option staff crew were arrogant and uncooperative unprofessionally treating passengers more important thing is the airline is not following any covid19 social distancing the plane was full of passengers with no seat gap inbetween passengers i am flying internationally for the last 12 years but have never seen this kind of service
15711,pacific airlines,4,this company has to learn a lot about communication,book through vietnam airlines a few days before departure pacific changed the original schedule of departure at departure we had a delay time of arrival of 3 hrs and 59 minutes since this is within 4 hrs they cant do anything as a token for inconvenience or so they say they provided drinks at the gate we did not see them providing it until the moment we were boarding the whole 4 hours no information was given except delayed on the screens no one appeared at the desk until 5 min before boarding this company has to learn a lot about communication and about moral behaviour sticking to the rules is more important than keeping your customers satisfied flight itself was okay with friendly staff
15925,peruvian airlines,2,dont want to pay us back,we had a delay for 5 hours with the excuse of bad weather at lima but when we where flying back from cusco they cancelled our flight because of the bad weather meanwhile lan and avianca were operating normally apparently peruvian airlines doesnt have a sofisticated gps system that its used for landing when there is fog so thats the reason why they always have problems with bad weather we had to buy new tickets with lan because peruvian told us that we can be stuck in cusco for a minimun of 2 more days until they can get us space on a flight we had our flight back to cr so we couldnt wait of course they dont want to pay us back the tickets because they dont refund bad weather issues
20303,thai smile airways,5,afraid missing next flight,it is more like lcc free luggage small snack given allow to select seats after blocking many seats saw it all vacant finally why self service to get water no serving delay saw history of operation delay every day unable to plan with 2 hours transit afraid missing next flight ask me to get the luggage at my final destination but pass immigration when i transit but luggage arrived international side so we had to walk to another terminal to get our luggage
2025,air koryo,7,flights on time,aircraft clean with immaculately presented and polite cabin attendants seat comfortable with great leg room flights on time inflight entertainment consisted of north korean military type music food was a cold burger with a choice of water coffee tea or soft drink
11944,jazz,8,jazz customer review,ewryul late evening flight the 45seat crj200 was halfempty so i managed to get two seats to myself it still does feel very tight though the overhead bins wont even take a smaller backpack and the seats are very confining in terms of personal space plus you really cant see out of the window due to its low position there was a single fa serving the flight which she managed with grace and efficiency even with a drink run and some small snacks served the service in general is ok but to spend more than an hour aboard the crj would be a torture
17217,rwandair,9,a very good experience,gatwick to dar es salaam via kigali we had a very good experience with rwandair new plane ample seats and leg room all drinks were free including alcohol and staff were friendly and polite on baggage checkin a novice member of gatwicks baggage handling staff accidentally pressed the button to send one of our suitcases onto the conveyor belt without any tags or labels on it disaster we thought but were reassured that it would very quickly be found after several enquiries as to its whereabouts we found ourselves at the gate about to board still without the missing case we didnt want to board the plane knowing it was here at gatwick but were approached and reassured by staff that he would make it his personal mission to find the case he gave us his card and we decided that email would be the best method of contact we arrived in dar es salaam where we had an email from him saying he hadnt yet found the case our hearts sank as we felt there was little chance of finding it we had one night in dar then caught the ferry over to zanzibar where we spent another night in stonetown that morning he emailed us to say that the case had been found sent on the first available flight to dar to then be forwarded by air to zanzibar airport where it would be arriving at 4pm that afternoon we couldnt believe it so thank you rwandair we have sung your praises since coming back home because it was the personal touch that set you aside from other reputable airlines we would very much enjoy flying with you again and would highly recommend this airline to anyone considering it no need to worry theyre brilliant go ahead and book it
22476,volotea,1,not enough space between these seats,on both ways we had the last seat on the planes 26a 26b 26c and 26d these seats do not have any window and there is not enough space between these seats and the front seat we had a baby with us who was sitting on the legs of his mother that was scary because the free space between the baby and the front seat was less than a hand palm we didnt have an extra scale for the back seats there was only one scale at the front of the airplane my husband forgot his polo ralf lauren hat which he placed on his seat he realized it immediately when we were on the bus on the way from the plane to the arrivals because it was late and with the baby it was difficult to go back to get it so i called the next morning the lost and found department of volotea in order to inform me how i can get the hat the answer was that nothing was delivered to them and to call again the next day which i did but again the answer was negative no hat has been found
3657,aircalin,5,aircalin customer review,sydnou economy a330 wonderful flight and service especially compared to qantas on the way back great food lovely wine and digestif
8669,emirates,5,onboard internet simply does not work,the onboard internet simply does not work if you complain the supplier for emirates sita for aircraft simply refuse to acknowledge that they failed to provide a service and issue a refund it appears from multiple reviews that this happens often emirates themselves apart from the nonexistent internet and poor third party aftersales experience were pretty good ample leg room friendly staff good selection of movies but poor food choice fish or vegetables only the checkin was also poor i followed the check in signs for economy seats at dubai airport t3 waited for around 2030 mins before being told to check in at desk 5 flights to usa i wasnt flying to the usa how am i supposed to know to follow that sign very poor understanding of the customer journey
3828,alaska airlines,8,great customer assistance by the staff,smooth flight round trip and witnessed a lot of patience and great customer assistance by the staff one of the 6 american airlines i will fly with and i have flown on small and 4 seater planes and have followed airline travel for decades since i am a huge travel buff safety is number one then customer service then cost then on time departures

16991,royal brunei airlines,6,ability to provide better,on my first leg from bandar seri begawan to singapore on a new a320neo aircraft the cabin was very fresh and clean the flight leave on time with no issue but the ife was not working shortly after take off the ife was not working i tried to inform the crew about it but the senior crew was busy chatting with the crew in the back galley 30 minutes later i told one of the crew about the ife he said he will inform his superior on my way back from jakarta to bwn a new a320neo once again everything seems good about the cabin the ife was working before the aircraft push back from the stand in cgk took a little time to browse the ife i fly with rb every month since july the tv guide and other movie list channel has never been change or refresh the movies and tv channel were very out dated and its getting bored to watch the same film or tv program again and again i finally get the chance to select a movie and the flight into an hour later the ife restart itself i think this airlines has the ability to provide better products and the services including the crew dealing with problems need more training in customer service
21793,virgin america,4,done nothing to earn my patronage,boston to san francisco ive lived in northern ca for two years now but am originally from ma so whenever i go home i get a redeye from sfo and a day time return trip my flight from sfo has never had a problem we leave on time and the plane is usually some what empty that said i have never gotten out of boston with out a problem the last time i took this flight they forgot to load water on to the plane and during the time they took to load water an ice storm came and they left us sitting on the tarmac for hours today we were delayed but there was nothing indicating why or even that we were delayed period when i tried to change my ticket the captain came out to announce that the flight would take off and even though we were now going to arrive in sfo after all public transit was closed and the bus i was scheduled to take to sonoma county will be gone i couldnt change my ticket without incurring a 150 dollar charge while the staff was apologetic they were incredibly unhelpful one member literally had a tantrum while i was talking to her partner virgin has done nothing to earn my patronage and i suspect they will do little to earn yours
6882,china airlines,7,a350 was very comfortable,amsterdam to seoul via taipei the flight in the a350 from amsterdam to taipei was very comfortable especially the food and inflight entertainment made a good impression wifi was available however quite expensive the second flight from tpe to icn was in the boeing 747400 this plane felt quite old and the seats and inflight entertainment were obviously old
17942,shenzhen airlines,7,no signs of priority checkin,shenzhen to xian it took me 10 minutes to find first class checkin while there was no signs of priority checkin in the terminal which is quite strange for me while shenzhen airport is hub airport of shenzhen airlines checkin and security were efficient lounges were comfortable and food tasteful flight attendants friendly and attentive first class seats on this short haul flight was great recommended
4584,asiana airlines,4,crew was the real positive,overall experience on asiana was not great the attentiveness and friendliness of the flight attendants and crew was the real positive the plane was old business class seats were uncomfortable and too short food was just ok the flight itself was one of the bumpiest ive been on
19696,tam airlines,6,tam airlines customer review,ezegig oneway in business class very early departure from eze checkin took longer than needed as the staff seemed very chatty amongst themselves security was very fast and they did not mind that i brought my water through lounge was ok but basic aircraft was a reasonable a32x on board it is 2x2 old style recliners which is much better than regional business class in europe which is usually 3x3 with free middle seat due to the early departure i went straight to sleep but woke up for breakfast which was ok then some more sleep landed on time in rio immigration had about 30 people ahead of me as one of the us originated planes had landed earlier bags were ready when i reached the baggage area easy customs as they did not seem to want to scan anyone that day would choose tam again on this route as the only other airline offering business is emirates which gets to rio past midnight
1451,air china,4,you pay for what you get,paris to tokyo via beijing the price was great and i wanted to give the airline a chance and fly with them for the 1st time tickets not booked on their website not able to choose seats or special meals i contacted the airline per email and i could order one special meal i checked in the day before departure to be sure we sit together seating was 333 on the b777 if im right better than the 343 on some airlines checkin opened around 3 hours before departure the economy class line was very long im star alliance gold member and i could use the business class pretty fast and checkin staff in paris very friendly but the seats i had checked in for the day before were not available anymore and i ended up on a middle seat boarding began 30 minutes later but we arrived on time at beijing airport i was positively surprised about the service onboard well its just a short version of the service of lufthansa turkish or ana and they dont come as often with drinks during and after the service you get plastic cutlery but its ok for the price the food was not a highlight but not bad the flight attendants mostly friendly with a good understanding of english they are quick to serve but dont expect too much interaction like you have with ana or lufthansa they are here to serve not to answer questions inflight entertainment a bit old not very responding froze and had to be reset the problem was the transfer from international to international expect long lines for passport control yes they do have one and security check and no special line for gold members business class the line was huge and disorganized passengers with a european passports were eventually asked to bypass the main ine and line up for the automatized passport control which was much quicker afterwards again disorganised line for security control lighters and larger power banks are not allowed all electronic equipment also bluetooth headphones and walletspurses had to be taken out of the bag unfriendly staff you should always calculate at least one hour and half for connecting flights there is no smoking area at pek airport keep in this in mind if you book a long transit time air china business gold lounge pretty full but ok for the price again the airport has several restaurants and many shops and is modern with big windows over the apron boarding to tokyo hnd began on time the service for a 3 hour flight was good and quick but not so friendly the a321 was dirty not only my tray table was dirty with stains food sauce and also the overhead bins and panels had grey stains we arrived on time business class passengers and gold members didnt get their luggage before normal economy passengers overall i would say you pay for what you get the inflight experience was satisfying but the ground progress at pek changed my mind for solo travellers ok with a cheap fare not for families or business travellers
13467,lao airlines,4,lao skyway customer review,we flew from vientiane to pakse the flight left and arrived on time the plane was cramped beyond belief only one carryon bag fitted overhead the other sat between us because it would not fit under the seat either first time that has ever happened service was ok but the whole cabin was incredibly small and on a full flight which ours was that meant uncomfortable if i ever fly this airline again ill check that i am not flying on an ma60
18079,silkair,9,inflight services were very good,surabaya to singapore return it was our first time flying silkairs newest boeing 737800 this new aircraft has sky interior design which is very beautiful and relaxing our flight to surabaya tookoff on time and landed ahead of schedule by 10 minutes the ground staff at changi international airport was very helpful when she gave us assistance to use the self checkin kiosk for the first time it was quite simple to use after a few clicks you can print out your boarding pass as well as your luggage tag then you can proceed to the checkin counter to drop your luggage however we had a minor problem when we dropped our bags at the checkin counter an agent told us only two out of three bags were registered then that agent helped us to recheckin our three bags altogether the inflight services were very good and the meals had nice taste once we landed at juanda international airport there was another minor problem with the baggage delivery we were told our baggage would be delivered from carousel number 4 and waited for about 10 minutes before it then moved to carousel number 3 again it took ages to get our bags delivered there were approximately 1015 minutes intervals to collect all the three luggage it was not silk airs fault but the delivery system at juanda which needs to be sorted out
15176,norse atlantic airways,4,charged us 120 euros to check a bag,my flight from jfk to berlin was fine no complaints on the flight back though they charged us 120 euros to check a bag that they accepted as a carryon in the us we noticed on our flight back to the us that the plane wasnt anywhere close to full and that the overhead bins had abundant space for our bags this is clearly another budget airline desperate to rip money out of passengers wallets at the last moment and im happy theyre cutting off their jfkberlin route in late august two stars not one though since their flight attendants are universally lovely maybe the money getting scammed out of my wallet is going toward actually paying them well
7904,cubana airlines,3,cubana airlines customer review,outbound my partner and i were travelling gatwick to cuba for a two week holiday we got on the plane to discover the rubbery arm on my seat hanging off as we took off my partners seat reclined along with the passenger sat in front of her this continued every time we had a slight incline throughout the flight about an hour into the flight i asked the stewardess if there would be any films to which she replied sometimes we do sometimes we dont needless to say on this occasion they didnt provide any when the food cart arrived we learned that they had already run out of wine and as the flight progressed they started to run out of every other liquid content inbound an hour delay we had still not boarded no representative at the gate to advise us yet again there was no inflight entertainment with no explanation we had an average meal which needless to say was our only highlight to this journey my partner and i are frequent travellers yet have never experienced such an embarrassing display of customer service
7659,croatia airlines,8,nofrills airline delivers as planned,zagreb to dubrovnik a320 aircraft which is comfy friendly service experience at the airport was smooth website is very easy to use and allows for online checkin and seat selection easily with mobile iphone wallet boarding pass etc preflight email notifications for checkin and flight info were very useful service onboard friendly and flight was ontime i had a technical question on my booking after the flight and was able to find the customer service email address directly on croatian airlines website and email them a customer rep replied in perfect english within a couple of hours with all the details overall nofrills airline but delivers as planned with uptodate digital platform and the experience was very smooth for a very competitive price

11109,horizon air,4,very poor customer service,my flight from calgary was delayed due to a mechanical error i had a connection to anchorage that i barely made due to the delay my disappointment was that i had paid for a premium seat and they gave it away to someone else they gave me a middle seat and told me i would have to call to get reimbursed for a credit that is very poor customer service heads up the premium seats have more leg room but sit 3 across and are narrow the inflight movie app did not work on my iphone 6s nor did it work on my brand new lap top i would avoid this airline in the future
19950,thai airasia,4,a very normal flight,bangkok to cochin flight departed on time it was a very normal flight every thing was in order though there was some nasty co passengers nothing more or less i love air asia for the very affordable rates by which you can travel plenty have one concern that i felt that the cabin was very hot might be because the flight was full but need to set little bit lower temperature in such cases
7826,csa czech airlines,7,very confortable seats,prague to brussels we had an hour delay due to the bad weather and air traffic the plane was clean with very confortable seats landing was very smooth airline does not offer anything so you have to pay from their catalog ticket was very cheap 38 euro not bad for a 15 flight
22385,volaris,1,customer service was horrible,volaris is by far the worst airline that i have ever flown not were the flights just delayed but they boarded us then had to take us off for maintenance and didnt help us change our connecting flights just said not to worry they will handle them when you get to mexico city needless to say after trying to run and catch my gate which i couldve made they said i couldnt board because i needed to go get my bag ended up missing the connection and the next available flight wasnt till the next morning their customer service was horrible they are completely disorganized rude and not helpful at all and had zero compensation for all of the people nothing from food to hotel rooms to transportation credits or refunds the airplane also had no air conditioning food water or anything not only did they waste my money and time but didnt even help resolve the issues at hand
17885,shanghai airlines,3,shanghai airlines customer review,pvghak the ryanairstyle legroom in their b737700 shocked me definitely insufficient for almost 3 hours flight catering was slightly better than on the flights with the parental china eastern but still i expected more
23144,zipair,1,excellent experience with zipair,excellent experience with zipair from quick and very kind check in assistant to a timely and pleasant flight was very lucky to get the seat with more leg space so it was not as hard a night as i feared i slept all night so no idea if there was food and how much it cost
11226,iberia,4,flight was a big disappointment,the a350900 a first for me and i was very excited to fly iberia for the first time the flight was a big disappointment the problems started at checkin long queues and unclear instructions on what covid documents were required to show at this stage caused the queue to move very slowly boarding was not much better the process was slow and unclear passengers stood in wrong rows and the order in which people were being boarded was very chaotic causing a long queue in the jet bridge after a 45 minute delay and everybody onboard ib3166 left madrid for london the crew handed out a small sanitation kit and a small bottle of water there were no menu cards available due to covid and the menu was not available on the ife there was no option to purchase other food or drinks or any of the luxury items iberia advertises on the ife a bit disappointing since i was planning on purchasing some food for my short layover at lhr the seat on the a350 impressed me it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom a relatively large ife screen and adjustable headrest the ife shut down after 30 minutes into the flight and the flight crew refused to help me by resetting the screen the crew seemed tired and not interested in the passengers the flight attendants were not visible during the flight and did not respond to people calling for help using the button on the ife this caused issues upon arrival at lhr they did not have a system for deboarding passengers were queueing in the aisles and pushing forward towards the exit of the aircraft a very disappointing experience and i expected the iberia crew to perform far better than this in conclusion iberia showed me to be an airline which is just average when it comes to these flights the seat on the a350900 was amazing but the fact that there was no food service no system behind the boarding process and the flight crew being uninterested in the passengers experience showed me that i would rather pay more to fly another airline on a route such as this one
13392,lan peru,4,lan peru customer review,limpiutbplim economy good service ground and on board small snack served and drinks offered on all flights entertainment also offered on all the short flights seats are comfortable good experience overall

2224,air malta,3,air malta customer review,long waits and delays poor check in service they had lost our booking if you try to eat the cardboard bread roll youll need the bottle of water take your own inflight movie as there is none
19834,tap portugal,6,staff were friendly,this was a short flight from lisbon to faro after my previous flight into lis with tap needed to be rebooked due to a long delay which would have left me stranded over night in lis the boarding was ontime and without problems they let us wait a long time in the bus though the plane was modern and roomy staff were friendly and efficient arrival was on time and deboarding quick and efficient seat was comfortable but nothing special
511,aeromexico,4,wasted money for a flexible ticket,when i purchased flights for an additional fee i was offered a more flexible option for changing flight dates i took the inbound flight then thought to return a week later than planned when i tried to use it the change fee was more than the round ticket itself i went to the airline website and purchading an oneway ticket was even cheaper than changing the date in my case i wasted money for a flexible ticket
11274,iberia express,4,not a comfortable experience,gran canaria to madrid from start to finish i felt like there was so many problems firstly i arrived at the airport early so i didnt have to leave my baggage in the hold however everyone who was priority was allowed on before they put people into groups so i was group 3 the last even though i was the first near the gate after that my luggage was put into hold once on the flight the staff seemed disconnected and also flustered themselves i suppose because things dont run smooth the back of my seat was broken so i had to be transferred next to a mother and small baby crying at this point i just wanted to rest the food and drinks were overpriced and i had to pay 250 for a tea which was that bad i had to ask for it to be changed the hot water was not warm enough to brew the tea so it ended up looking like dirty dishes water at the other end of the flight i waited over 20 mins to get off the plane and then a further half an hour to get my bag which was only very small not a comfortable experience in total and wouldnt think of flying again with them easyjet is a much better option for low cost
20772,transaero airlines,4,transaero airlines customer review,our flight from viedelhi was alright an immense 15 hrs waiting time for the connecting flight though service is minimal food is minimalistic our flight back from delhi was actually ok the ac seems extreme the food was more in quantity but less in quality our 10 hrs for the connecting flight back to vienna turned out to be 13 hrs almost every flight was delayed 25 up to 4 hrs this airport aims for international however the amount of people in the shops and food courts who speak english is almost zero please transaero improve your quality
15971,philippine airlines,4,schedule that was changed three times,this flight is a replacement schedule for the original flight schedule that was changed three times the original flight was supposed to head to hnl then connect to las via a different airline the original schedule had at least 5 hours layover which we were going to use to meet some relatives at the airport pal made adjustments three times until it already affected the connecting flight schedule which pal did not adjust if i hadnt informed them about this it would have been a disaster so the replaced the original schedule into a completely different schedule and airports we have to cancel meeting with my relatives not the first time this happened similarly the outbound flight 10 days ago was also replaced with a different flight schedule and plane also noticed food is not as great as what it was a decade ago we are seriously thinking we wont fly pal again in the future unless they improve
9059,eurowings,7,isnt really a business class,checked in on eurowings app but had to go at check in desk as i had some questions regarding lounge priority lane etc the person at the business class counter was not aware of anything basically denied me lounge access eventually indicating me the wrong lounge and priority lane at the end i could enjoy the priority lane and had no problems getting into the right lounge by simply asking people working at the airport onboard incredibly nice flight attendant in the front of the cabin she really made a difference business class with eurowings isnt really a business class except lounge access and priority lanesboarding depending on the airport of departure while flying the perk is basically the seat next to yours is not occupied and you can choose from the onboard sales menu and get the items for free still all is in a paper cup and packed so dont expect a nice presentation on china of what you eat you just havent to pay for it as long you paid your business class fare
3060,air transat,5,they were with their sarcasm just laughing,returning may 27 2022 from the dominican republic flight 187 arriving in toronto at 445 pm we stayed in the aircraft for to hours because of the backup of the security theyve told us they would put water in the toilets not so people were looking after the 2 hours wait the captain announced we can board people with children from 12 and under not so even the older once went nobody came back after a while 50 of the rest could go etc there was a group of people on the aircraft returning from a wedding standing and making it difficult for others to get by evenso they were told to sit down mask was mandatory but not for some people one lady was yelling shots shots and open the bottle of liquor finally as we elderly people got to the exit we complained to the captain and staff they were with their sarcasm just laughing

23072,xl airways france,3,xl airways france customer review,we flew xl france out of paris searching their website was most unhelpful unlike air asia tiger air and jetstar all are low cost carriers in asia we found xl france website the least interactive with customers our attempts to communicate with xl france to purchase two seat upgrades met with a wall we had to get friends in paris to talk to them otherwise food in premium economy was good what saved the day was a stewardess who was very professional with her excellent service to all leaving today 2013 for paris fm cancun and am told by xl i can only purchase an upgrade at the airport so it means leaving early to wait in queue you wished xl france could be more customer friendly
14828,monarch airlines,5,choose a different airline next time,flew with monarch airlines for the first time from manchester to orlando sanford and i would choose a different airline next time the main meal was very small and the breakfast was a muffin and a yogurt the crew were friendly but drinks were expensive the aircraft seemed old as the windows were scratched and the cabin was dirty
3376,airasia philippines,5,more hassle than id like,bangkok to manila round trip don mueang to manila was 1 hour late and the return leg nearly 3hrs late due to technical problems with the aircraft check in in bangkok was a zoo manila a little better flights themselves were no frills fine apart from the delays and in neither case did the captain apologise for the delay or even acknowledge it fare price was cheaper than philippine airlines or cebu pacific but routing through dmk instead of bkk resulted in more hassle than id like not a good choice if you have connecting flights
21205,turkish airlines,5,are not going to reimburse,worst communication we booked a flight from dallas to naples via istanbul the first flight was delayed they told us this ends up with us missing the second flight and being put onto a flight 15 hours later than our booked flight the second flight was scheduled for 825 am the next day the airline provided us with a hotel room and dinner in istanbul but they didnt provide breakfast to use the hotel we had to enter the city and get a visa turkish airlines agent told us to pay visa by ourselves and then submit the receipts to the airline to get reimbursed and we did after our trip i called their customer service and they told me to submit the receipts through the website feedback section i did feedback responded and asked for more documents i sent them the visa pages in the passport and all boarding passes and payment receipts feedback responded to me that they closed the case and are not going to reimburse it looks weird after getting all they needed they refused to pay and closed the case again i called customer service and they put an objection on the case my question is why they waste customers time if the feedback department is not able to do the reimbursement why does staff tell the customer to go through feedback to get reimbursed if the feedback is able to reimburse why do they refuse to pay after asking for more documents it seems no one knows how to resolve this case just wasting our time
3885,alaska airlines,4,not enough space for carry on bags,expensive delayed for 50 mins and not enough space for carry on bags so i had to check my bag waste more than 1hr 30mins in total very bad experience wont choose alaska airlines for seattle anymore
1100,air botswana,4,air botswana customer review,air botswana to and from johannesburg and maun the staff were friendly and outward journey jnbmain was fine the return journey was chaos to start with the checkin at maun airport was chaotic the lounge was completely full of passengers trying to check in air botswana had chartered another aircraft and upon boarding some passengers had no seats so they were told that they would have to catch the next flight once aboard they told us that the aircraft couldnt take our bags and that they would be in jnb on the next flight apparently 2 hours later i was connecting with a flight to europe and if i had known that earlier i could have labelled my bag accordingly and i might have tried to check my bag through the whole way i felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers they couldnt take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough the problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard we flew via gabarone to refuel then in johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow at least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later however that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as air botswana must have known this in maun he took down all our details and where we wanted our bags sent if we werent staying in johannesburg i honestly didnt expect to see my bag again three days later at home in spain an air botswana rep phones me and asks me which airport in spain i want my bag sent to zaragoza is 15 hours drive away and the nearest airport my bag arrived there 2 days later if any other airline flew between main and johannesburg i would try them i think air botswana needs some competition
12908,klm royal dutch airlines,5,very disappointing and uncourteous,my last flight from toronto to johannesburg was an utter disappointment although boarding and seating ran relatively smooth the service on board definitely was not up to standard the food during our flight from toronto to amsterdam basically inedible the only food that i could muster was the dessert drinks have been reduced to only being served either wine or beer or soft drinks during our meal and during the flight any other requests for drinks met with a very disappointing and uncourteous flight attendant i have never been so disappointed in flying with klm as with this experience i really think klm should rethink the menus and what they offer to the passengers on an international flight in the way of beverages offered
9060,eurowings,3,premium price to fly low cost,booked on eurowings and flown on a brand new airbus 220 of air baltic an excellent seat pitch in a crisp and pleasantly illuminated cabin but the aircraft and crew were carrying out the flight on behalf of eurowings and the fact remains i paid eurowings a premium price to fly low cost not complaining flying no frills and so this flight was but definitely it is unacceptable paying high fares for nothing unfortunately often eurowings owned by lufthansa is the only option flying in or into dsseldorf if one needs to fly directly without stopovers within europe and therefore one has in most cases no alternatives
20823,transasia airways,9,transasia airways customer review,travel again with tna to tpe from sin on 1117 sep outgoing flight was not full but service is good the a330300 was brand new so no complaints about dirty seats carpets toilets food uplifted from sin could have been better selected wv from the menu during booking but the food on the return leg was much better the best inflight food i have tasted so far one disappointment is that the cabin attendants did not serve packets of peanuts on the return leg but provided the much needed juice that i asked for the peanuts would have gone down well with the drink
22168,vivaaerobs,1,they leave when they decide to leave,the flight was scheduled for 805pm and about 30 minutes before that time a gate assigned not long after i got to the gate a garbled verbal announcement was made i went to the viva office who confirmed it had been delayed until 1030pm at 945 the notice board said the flight time was 1130pm i arrived at the gate just before 11pm just as the gate notice board changed to indicate the plane had lifted off 30 minutes before the time indicated by the time i found my way to their customer service desk there were still about a dozen very angry customers still in line having missed connections forfeited hotels and car rentals when i got to the desk they put me on a flight the next morning no apology no explanation of what happened all i can say is wow they leave when they decide to leave and here i am spending the night in the airport
22947,xiamen airlines,8,the crew was attentive,kuala lumpur to shenyang via xiamen the crew was attentive especially to the elderly chinese on board checking if they are comfortable and needs drink their food is very chinese and tasty i like that they served steamed corn at the end what i didnt like lack of inseat entertainment
18903,spicejet,1,worst experience every time,worst experience every time no time sense keeps getting delayed or cancelled not recommended staff very rude and irresponsible do not help you out when the mistake is on their side
19651,tam airlines,7,i would recommend it,i was returning from visiting a friend in uruguay and it involves a full day of travel flying tam airlines from montevideo to london via sao paolo they had inflight entertainment on loop for 2h 30m flight from montevideo to sao paulo the flight from sao paulo to london was without concern on the way out my inflight entertainment broke and i had to do without for the flight from london to sao paolo the crew were professional seats were comfortable as it was an overnight flight they offered a twocourse eveining meal and breakfast in the moring all in all i would recommend it as an airline to fly to and from south america with
18575,smartwings,1,by far the worst experience,gatwick to prague i have flown approximately 100 times in the past ten years but this was by far the worst experience six hour delay fair enough these things happen though ancient planes dont help but a paltry 10 voucher insufficient to buy any food while waiting and then a failure to even acknowledge two emails and one online message has made me so angry the website says they will respond within 24 hours but nothing most organisations can turn a negative into a positive through good communication and apologies smartwings do the opposite i would like to score it 010 but theres a minimum score of one
15993,philippine airlines,3,the seats were not layflat,in february 2023 my wife and i travelled roundtrip from san francisco to manila philippine airlines was the only nonstop option that we could find the flights and arrivaldeparture times were within reason airline personnel and their service was always very good we traveled on a b777300 which was fine but the business cabin was original the entertainment system appeared to have crt monitors built into the seats they worked about as well as 20 yearold crt screens not well movietvmusic selections were poor there was no lack of space not compartmentalized the seats were not layflat there was no stowage for blanketpillow apart from your lap or the floor in front of you one was viewing the monitor from a distance of about 45 feet generally it was not comfortable or what i would expect in 2023 the food would have been ok for premium economy the wine was generic and ok for no better than economy the lounges at sfo and manila were disappointing
15263,norwegian,6,arrived 15 minutes ahead of time,norwegian flight from copenhagen to helsinki on 07feb operated by jet time departed five minutes ahead of schedule and arrived 15 minutes ahead of time due to the shortage of planes norwegian has wetleased a number of planes from other companies because of this issue this flight was operated by danish charter airline jet time with a not entirely new boeing 737700 the plane was a little worn but fine for the short one and a half hour flight the jet time cabin crew seemed to be a little less trained than norwegians regular crew but they were smiling and helpful if people had questions in general i would much prefer flying jet time rather than facing a cancellation due to the shortage of planes however if you expect modern planes decent legroom and wifi you should probably not choose a flight operated by jet time
9541,firefly,9,firefly customer review,excellent service throughout szbpen return enjoy their complimentary grape juices nuts and muffin quiet cabin and cabin crew were very nice the fare is cheap too
12586,jetstar pacific,3,staff were in a bad mood,hi chi minh city to hanoi with jetstar pacific and i take the first flight in the morning the counters open only 15h before the flight and all the staff were in a bad mood one of them ask me to return to my queue because she doesnt want to serve passengers with luggage she said to me why do you change your queue go back there i check in only passengers without luggage while there was no signboard or information on the screen saying that its a special counter and she could have said for example sorry i serve only passengers without luggage it would be nicer the flight was correct the food and beverages are more expensive than other competitors and the announcements are rough as well last thing is the cabin storage bins above rows 12 are occupied by staff hand luggage while you have to pay extras to get those seats
20022,thai airways,6,price is bit high for what you actually get,flight tg910 bangkoklhr 12hrs 40 mins boarding needs to be more understandable the cabin crew were outstanding on customer service very polite friendly nothing was too much trouble for them they all worked hard food was average seats were a bit tight pitch although it is new aeroplane so i thought there would be more space with a 3x3x3 seat configuration as others airlines 777 can have 3x4x3 seat configuration at first the cabin was too hot no personal ac to adjust not comfortable but later in the flight aircon is better the inflight entertainment was touch screen and very responsive but the content was average music needs updating i probably would not fly this direct flight again with thai air better to use an airline that stops halfway you can stretch your legs have a break from flying at a hub and get on another flight for the second part of the journey in my opinion but i thought i would give it a try to see the difference the price for thai air is bit high for what you actually get date of experience 31 march 2023
904,air astana,8,cabin crew were effective,bangkok to almaty on boeing 757 quick and efficient check in and given priority pass and lounge invitation boarding was quick seats were angled flat but reasonably comfortable cabin crew were effective and had good english meals were quite tasty but not quite to the standard that i have come to expect from air astana flight was uneventful and landed a few minutes early luggage come quite quickly off the plane almaty to moscow a320 early morning departure and the traditional sit up business seat with reasonable leg room and comfort food was a little disappointing compared to previous flights portable entertainment with reasonable selection of films although i mostly slept cabin crew were good and again had very good english skills plane left and landed on time and luggage came very quickly off the flight
22285,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,lcyman excellent service on this shorthaul domestic flight flight attendants offered omelette sandwiches and rice pudding as well as a choice of hot and cold beverages with the complimentary meal the ticket was only marginally more expensive than taking the train or a nofrills airline despite a very busy friday evening at londons city airport and a fullybooked flight we landed in manchester on schedule

12658,jin air,8,jin air customer review,hkgicn this is a korean low cost carrier low cost in the asian sense you still get a meal box and numbered seating i used them having got stuck in hong kong after a problem with my cathay ticket the station manager at hong kong was very helpful the flight was a third full and the service friendly and efficient ontime arrival made all the difference i would definitely recommend
7686,croatia airlines,7,croatia airlines customer review,30 min delay polite and attentive staff it seems that generally flights of this airline that are scheduled for the afternoon tend to be a bit delayed basic meal offered during this short flight with an option to top it up with purchased food and drinks flight about 70 full generally smooth service and no particular problems

4522,arik air,6,arik air customer review,i have flown arikair both long short haul a few times now and got mixed experiences the not so good experience was with the ground staff at lagos in may 2010 when i was harassed dispossessed of expensive perfume bottles 50mls each with contents even less i wrote a letter of complaint but never got a reply generally the services are fair but lack of online checking and ineffective communication has let it down i can also observe that the aircrafts are flown 12 or less full most of the time and wonder why prices are still up

21669,vietnam airlines,5,flight itself was quite pleasant,travelling business class was an easy decision with very good fares out of sydney luckily i was aware of a 16 hour layover on return journey despite this i enjoyed a day in hanoi the flight itself was quite pleasant and the staff were very polite and were really helpful with my age 71 with very good food however the nightmare began when i requested the posting of frequent flier miles the first response was standard we will reply within 5 days was advised of only 1000 miles and requested documentation sent within 24 hours this went back and forth to the end result being told to send more documentation i forwarded everything but my original boarding pass difficult given that it was an electronic boarding pass to my phone three months 21 emails numerous facebook messages later advised to call lotusmiles in vietnam unfortunately they could not assist as they did not speak english but to send email i had already requested via travel agent to purchase another trip but will not support vietnam airlines
5266,bahamasair,1,bahamasair customer review,we were picked up in miami over 15 hrs late on way home we got to airport over 2 hrs ahead of time and waited for our flight flight listed as on time and they boarded us to leave on time but then had to sit in a very hot cabin for over 1hr because they were waiting for late comers to get through customs this made us miss all our flights out of miami and when i finally got to dallas missed any chance of getting home

19522,swoop,1,changes of this magnitude are totally unacceptable,never again do not fly with swoop the money you save in airfare will be used up in inconvenience lost accommodations and car rentals they changed our flight from 8am to 920pm arriving in hamilton after the rental car counter was closed that means an extra night in hamilton even though our hotel in niagara on the lake is already paid for changes of this magnitude are totally unacceptable and not deserving of continued loyalty i would give them all zeros if i could
6077,british airways,1,cancel your flight without notice,top ten reasons to not use british airways to all be aware and be on notice travel at your own risk i have travelled for years on many different airlines and i have to say that british airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly dont waste your time or money customer service is nonexistent please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your money you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years when you work hard and save your money to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure makes millions on customers per year i understand that sometimes things happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note 1 the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered trust me the number is a secret 2 when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if someone answers they will not resolve your issues instead they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to no one takes ownership 4 what airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesnt have customer service reps to help you the customer british airways thats who 5 they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you at all no email no text 6 if you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary you may or may not get notifications 7 if you pay for seats and you pick them it doesnt matter they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid 8 the flight may be cheaper but it is not once you are done paying for seats 9 they will route to another partner airline and not notify you 10 if you have a connecting flight they will cancel one leg and not the other and not notify you i will never use them again and if this review helps one person that heeds my advice then my job is done
9253,ravn alaska,6,ravn alaska customer review,ancfaianc economy open seating check in was difficult the checkin agent did not understand how to read my ticket and almost seemed to blame me for the error once on board however the flight attendants both on the outbound and return were very nice especially on the return flight a definite sense of humor era offers low fares between anchorage and fairbanks and i will be flying with them again its also nice not to have to go to security when flying on the smaller planes
544,aeromexico,1,really bad experience,terrible experience with aeromexico in mexico city flight number am 378 on december 28 2022 first of all they dont even board by zones and second thing i was on zone 3 along side with my wife i paid for the seats i was in i wasnt even ask to gate check my bag and one of the staff member just pulled me aside and took my bag without asking what zone i was in and than proceed to throw the tag at me really bad experience with aeromxico will not recommend
20978,tui airways,3,i think we have identified a training need,i have holidayed in corfu for the last 25 years and appreciate that the runway is short the outbound flight landing has to be the worst i have ever experienced to my mind we were approaching too high and too fast we landed heavily with the aircraft lurching from side to side hanging on for dear life not a pleasant start to the holiday the return flight started positively but on the approach to london stansted we came down in fits and starts causing a lot of anxiety other passengers were also concerned about the roller coaster descent and there was huge relief when the plane landed and eventually came to a halt however we were left onboard without the doors being opened for almost half an hour after the engines had stopped with no explanation as to why one bad landing can be excused but if this is normal for tui pilots i think we have identified a training need
18927,spicejet,1,too many flight delays cancellations,flight sg3024 the flight was scheduled to start at 315 pm they preponed it to 3 pm they have this weird rule that you have to web check in 1 hour before the flight and they dont have the facility to check in physically at the terminal my fatherin law who was the passenger who was returning from pune to hyderabad was a senior citizen and was returning back after attending the death ritual of a relative had a harrowing time with arrogant staff who were not willing to help him they said they will refund the airfare but fingers crossed show me the money and then i will believe some thing is wrong with spicejet lots of problems too many flight delays cancellations we should avoid this airline

10739,gulf air,7,little glitches gulf air should address,london to bahrain in business class having flown their a330s before i was looking forward to experience the difference in their 787s firstly the seat is a 2x2x2 configuration with open suite style seating the window seats which i chose offered privacy once the screen was raised up and every seat has direct aisle access the seat is fabulous comfortable with all the adjustments including a massage function except for the headphone socket which was a difficult to see as it was hidden in a darker area by the seat i loved the windows which could be darken and lightened there is little storage space but if you were not stretching out to a full flat bed the front area underneath the tv monitor allowed for an ample storage area the amenity kit was basic but they did provide pjs even on the daylight flights however the ife is very limited with a small selection of movies and programmes service was a mixed bag while welcoming and friendly the cabin crew were nonengaging instead providing the service in a professional and swift manner there were the usual welcome drinks including champagne with top ups offered dates arabic coffee and hot cold towels throughout i still cannot get over the gimmick of the onboard chef as i just cannot see the advantage and wish they didnt take the menus away i wanted to see the wine list again but was offered just red or white two choices but didnt see the bottle nor was i able to taste first these are little glitches gulf air should address to improve their product to near perfection the food in general was very tasty and i love their signature dish of lamb shank proper afternoon cream teas and so on i had to curtail my trip due to the pandemic and the return flight was understandably basic no hot food no pillows no blankets pjs etc and disposable plastic cutlery
8717,emirates,5,the service has gone downhill,check in at manchester airport was fine take off time was delayed by 40 minutes as it arrived 20 minutes late the service has gone downhill since i last flown with them there was no drinks services or menu cards it was not a full flight so had the whole row of seats to myself which i utilised as a bed the a380800 is a great plane to fly plenty of seat and leg room and alo very quiet the 2nd journey was completely different the boeing 777300er was old very narrow with limited leg room the engines were loudt he comment cattle class comes to mind there was a vietnamese couple sat next to me the crew thought i was with them and handed me the same meal drinks as them luckily i wanted the same meal as them she then realised that we were not together when i spoke and asked for a different drink the crew seemed to lack interest i would fly with them again but only because of their competitive price
5547,belavia,9,i will choose belavia again,brussels charleroi to minsk it was my first time to fly belavia the flight was ok the crew was very friendly and helpful although english is still a problem i had more than enough space on my seat i am 195m and my knees did not even touch the back of the seat in front of me return flight same story nice and friendly crew we got some sweets something to drink water or juice and a small lunch chicken or pork coffee tea or water as you wish there was no inflight entertainment but i did not miss it in short very neat and complete care i will choose belavia again for my next flight to minsk

13231,la compagnie,6,do not fly this amateur operation,this june 2019 we booked on la compangnie newark to paris return our flight over was cancelled 48 hours before departure we had firm bookings on a flight paris to london la compagnie offered us a later flight instead of paris to nice of course we could not make our paris to london connection we dropped that and waited until the next morning flying directly to london from nice we incurred an extra nights stay in nice taxi rides a lost ticket from paris to london lost return flight when you dont show for the first flight you lose the return and a lost night in our london hotel adding up to over a thousand dollars in extra costs at the end of our stay in england and paris we were told that our flight from paris to newark was also cancelled if we arrived at 800 am at orly we would be put on the morning flight instead of the more comfortable afternoon departure 2 flights for 2 people both cancelled and we are repeat customers the check in people at la compangie said the company would meet us they did not would reimburse us if we showed receipts they did not after multiple attempts to contact anyone by phone and waiting for 4 weeks they more or less told us too bad we owe you nothing unless you are willing to see your flight changed with very little notice and you have a great deal of flexibility or insurance at the other end do not fly this amateur operation
14347,lynx air,6,delay ended up being 15 hour delay,flew with lynx for the 1st time i flew from winnipeg to toronto for may long weekend the flight into toronto was on time zero issues clean and i was quite impressed flight into toronto was 1010 for value and timeliness i also did not check a bag i only brought my personal item back pack they were not strict with requirements at all cause my backpack was totally full my return flight however was a mess upon getting to toronto airport to get my boarding pass they stated at the front that i didnt actually need my boarding pass printed that they would accept it on my phone i said are you sure because the man who was saying this has his female coworker behind him stating no they dont do that so sure enough he did not print my pass once getting to the gate and close to boarding time they had everyone on the flight create a massive line to get their boarding passes since they were not printed off when they were supposed to be and the pass on the phone was not accepted like that employee had stated after this had been resolved and they printed passes for nearly everyone they announced 2 flight attendants had not shown up for their shift but that a replacement will be there within 15 min so it would be a 15 min delay the delay ended up being 15 hour delay once boarded they announced that had those flight attendants not come in last minute our plane would not have taken off luckily i made it home on my scheduled day but i would of hated to know how difficult it would be to deal with them had everyone have to stay and wait for another plane still undecided if ill use them again they have been in winnipeg almost a year already i think im going to lean towards flair and swoop for low cost flights as i havent had issues like this with those companies
8031,delta air lines,1,little better than a long domestic flight,i do not recommend this route when i purchased the ticket delta was partnered with air france i fly this route often and when operated by air france it was a much better experience deltas lax to paris now uses a domestic terminal with no access to duty free or the good airport lounges we had to use the delta one lounge which was the mcdonalds of airport lounges when we boarded the plane they did not offer champagne they had sparkling wine the business class cabin was mediocre and the the goody bag was kitch environmental rubbish i enjoy flying international because usually it is luxurious and a highlight of the trip this was a little better than a long domestic flight which is sad wont make this mistake again dont fly delta international out of lax delta stay in your lane and keep to domestic flights sub out your international flights to companies that remember what service and class was
13234,la compagnie,8,fantastic value for business class,paris orly to newark longtime customer of openskies when it was business class only and the original lavion chose la compagnie and glad we did our flight was canceled at orly back to newark and it was a mess the gate agents at orly did not speak english well and there was lack of information given we had to rebook 2 days later on another flight home on our own with the airline no one at the gate could assist us with that and they only have 2 planes and dont partner with other airlines 2 days stuck in paris with hotel hopping so why the 5 stars the compensation when we got home to the states and quick communication and customer service was great they offered to pay for our meals hotels and cabs for the 2 days stuck in paris the flights were so comfortable great entertainment on the flights and great food i was able to sleep comfortably with a pillow and the plane seemed very clean the flight crew was lovely both ways and couldnt have been nicer for the price this was a fantastic value for business class and was much better than united first class to paris i hope they stay in business
8978,etihad airways,4,did not provide me any room for stopover,it was mentioned on etihad airways that they will provide accomodation for stopover of more than 10 hours my stopover was around 23 hrs but etihad said they dont have any rooms left they did not provide me any room for stopover and said no rooms available for your dates i was trying to book room about 4 months ago i booked the room in abu dhabi airport hotel and interestingly it was the same hotel etihad airways told me that there are no rooms left they lied to me i dont recommend to travel with etihad if you have stopover of more than 23 hours
12065,jet airways,4,2kgs excess in baggage,chandigarh to new delhi rude and non cooperative staff at the check in counter i have flown many times but no flight has ever created a fuss over 2kgs excess in baggage although i dont have any hand baggage of 7 kg on top of it the person was really rude
21827,virgin america,5,seats had been changed,have generally been satisfied with virgin america though lately we have felt it necessary to pay extra for slightly more leg room and earlier boarding tonight i was surprised when printing out our boarding pass that our slightly better and more expensive seats had been changed without our knowledge according to the agent someone had called the airline and usurped our seats not a huge deal the someone pushed us 4 rows back but just goes to show that virgin is just as moneygrubbing as the rest
16300,porter airlines,3,do not communicate delays,toronto to newark if you want to depart at 6 get a ticket for 4 it is not only impossible for this airline to leave on time they do not communicate delays of course no one expects much from airlines but the level of sheer disrespect to customers by porter is out of control if youre returning to toronto in the evening that delay might cause you to be rerouted with no compensation horrible customer service avoid if possibleit is surely a first world complaint but few things cause me as much annoyance as porter airlines
8348,easyjet,1,easyjet have no customer service,easyjet have no customer service i was at the airport early i had already checked in and all i needed to do was a baggage drop i was good for time and then easyjet staff were calling for people to come forward first for the faroe islands and then for copenhagen which allowed them to skip the line and go ahead of me and other passengers i subsequently missed my flight to tel aviv and now have booked with klm for that evening easyjet customer service has been a disgrace to deal with and i wish that after 2 calls to your call centre and emails i was given zero customer support
21042,tuifly,4,seats uncomfortable,old aircraft seats very narrow and uncomfortable however so called premium class did not look much different the food was average strange tasting served in unsuitable packaging however the cabin staff was extremely positive friendly and helpful
7101,china southern airlines,9,i really appreciate the help,due to the traffic on the way to the airport i was late when i arrive i realize that i need to print out my covid test results in order to fly i was in a hurry and was panicking a ground staff saw me and asked if i needed any help i told him that i am going to miss my flight to lax if i dont have my covid test results he then quickly led me to the airports business center to get my results printed and then help me get through customs to save even more time i really appreciate the help that he have given me
22141,vivaaerobs,8,vivaaerobs customer review,the new a321 neo aircraft boarded on time and the cabin was spotlessly clean the flight attendants helped people stow their bags and were friendly and efficient the flight was full we left merida on time and arrived at tuxtla gutierrez on time the rows were somewhat close together but the 90minute flight was not uncomfortable on viva aerobus passengers pay for refreshments and there were few takers checked baggage was delivered by the time we arrived at baggage claim
14831,monarch airlines,8,good things to say about monarch airlines,nothing but good things to say about monarch airlines and their new seating used to always fly club europe with british airways to paphos at least 3 times a year but their standards have slipped considerably so resent paying the significant premium over economybudget airlines admittedly i always pay the extra for the extra legroom seats up the front but the pitch is greater than british airways european business class and the seats significantly more comfortable despite being roughly 5 times cheaper not always guaranteed a middle seat free but so far have been lucky and food refreshments not included however i never eat airline food anyway disclaimer my father in his own words is a fatty and he said after 3 hours or so the seat did feel a bit hard so maybe not so great for serial pie eaters
9150,eva air,3,disappointed with this flight,was extremely disappointed with this flight boarding in yyz was a gong show i had booked myself and my elderly parents into premium economy so we can board first and get the bags into the overhead storage and settle in instead my parents who are seated next to me boarded in zone 4 and i was in zone 5 how does that make sense that we are boarding so late and also at different times furthermore in terminal 1 they havent figured out how to coral people so you have people lining up arbitrarily somewhere and then some eva air staff would walk around with a card saying some zone number and expects everyone to move over and join them it was just pure chaos i was hoping that the meals and service would be great but it was not they only served only 2 meals for the 15 hour flight there wasnt an instant noodles snack on top of that my meals werent good the flight attendants rarely walk by to ask if i wanted water which left me quite parched unless i buzzed them meagre catalogue of new movies the shorter flight from taipei to kuala lumpur had ever so slightly better movies ac has better inflight movies seat incline was very very generous and because there was slightly more leg room the person in front leaning completely back doesnt make moving around in your own seat and even eating a big issue the flight arrived an hour late thankfully i left a lot of time because my elderly parents were not mobile and i gave myself a few hours to transfer
13295,lan airlines,3,hellish seat standards,sydney to santiago via auckland it had been several years since i had flown this route with lan and it was not a pleasant return with the new boeing 787 flying this route there has been a deterioration in passenger comfort with very poor leg room the food was lousy and for some strange reason the male stewards were very friendly but the females not at all so after reaching brazil and catching my local connecting flight with gol i was relieved to find the gol domestic aircraft with more leg room than the hellish seat standards that lan offered up for a 14 hour flight where i had to constantly contort my legs into a space that literally did not really exist
11282,iberia express,3,crew appeared disinterested,santiago to madrid cabin crew appeared disinterested and would not make eye contact with me when pushing the trolley the first time was when i wanted to purchase drinking water after the trolley was pushed two seats behind me i had to turn round get the attention of passengers the second time was when cabin crew were doing a rubbish run this time the flight attendant was looking the other way as i tried to get her attention i was in the middle seat found it difficult to move in the cramped seating because of the sleeping passenger in the aisle seat it appeared to me that the quicker the trolley was pushed down the aisle the less work the hostess had to do
485,aerolineas argentinas,7,aerolineas argentinas customer review,i flew from jfk to eze on october 214 the flight left on time and arrived on time i travelled in club condor the service was friendly and efficient new a330 aircraft the club condor seat was an inclined flat seat i found the seat to be hard and the angle for sleep was not comfortable i put the seat into a cradle configuration and was able to relax more and sleep for several hours the food needs improvement presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront i expected better the entertainment system was good there were a lot of movies to chose from there were several places to charge my devices i would fly with aerolineas again
22827,wow air,1,i was blindsided,amsterdam to san francisco via reykjavik never again i was blindsided by the seemingly cheap fares turns out it wasnt cheap at all because i needed to pay for luggage seats and what not what frustrated me the most was that my partners luggage did not arrive in san francisco we were without his suitcase for 10 out of 13 days on our vacation back home we filed a request and wow air granted us a compensation which they are bound to do by law and said that processing the payment would take between 1012 weeks very irritating how can making a money transfer take up to 12 weeks now after 4 months the money has not been transferred wow air does not answer our mails and the hotline employees keep putting me off what a scam do not book a flight with this airline it is most likely going into insolvency seeing as theyre withholding money and cancelling destinations altogether
9681,fly540com,8,fly540com customer review,used fly540com to fly from zanzibar to mombasa in june 2012 flight departed even before schedule as soon as everyone was aboard the plane was almost empty maybe about 1015 passengers the arrival was also about 30 minutes earlier then expected plane was an older bombardier we were served with a bottle of drinking water upon boarding service was friendly the flight was truly short and not much to comment on it should i need to travel within africa once again ill take fly540 without hesitation

21330,united airlines,1,flight was an all around disappointment,this flight was an all around disappointment while the flight attendants were friendly and were doing the best they could it was clear they were shortstaffed we sat at the back and at every meal they had run out of at least one of the offerings we had an unpleasant tasting vegetarian pasta for dinner and a very pathetic dry wrapped sandwich for lunch at sfo despite having a voucher offered by united for united club access the staff at the counter denied us entry because it was high season
21021,tuifly,7,it was a good experience,amsterdam to curacao on december 7th with tui fly netherlands operated by a boeing 7878 checkin was quite chaotic at amsterdam with multiple tui departures at the same time and only one staff member trying to sent passengers to the right checkin row checkin or bag dropoff boarding on the other hand was very smooth and efficient i prebooked economy comfort 34 inch leg space seat 12a which was quite comfortable the seat was quite narrow though the seat was equipped with an ptv with a pretty small selection of movies a free headset and pillow were distributed after take off the crew came around with a drink service alcohol was charged follow by a hot small meal with a drink and coffee or tea during the flight it was possible to order paid snacks or drinks but there were also two complementary drink rounds two hours before landing a sandwich with a slice of cake were handed out which was really tasteful the flight itself was uneventful and the crew was really friendly and professional overall it was a good experience for a typical holiday airline
1364,air caraibes,8,air caraibes customer review,i flew on tx from ory to fdf have to admit i was quite impressed the pa in 3 languages including creole meal was great with caribbean touch and 2 options in eco ptv on board larger than af coi very high density cheaper than other competitors colourful friendly cabin crew and on time performance was great very professional

14911,myanmar airways,5,myanmar airways customer review,bkkrgn on a319 leased together with crew from air mediteranee spotlessly clean plane but the leg space is just horrible so cramped tall passengers will really suffer luckily it is only a 1 hour flight service great and food ok plane left on time so overall nothing to complain about

21740,vietnam airlines,6,unsmiling cabin crew,sydney to ho chi minh city it seems a shame that vietnam airlines continues to shoot itself in the foot instead of improving my trip from sydney to ho chi minh city was afflicted by the same problems as in past 6 years the safety announcement prior to take off was almost inaudible and beyond comprehension i brought this to the attention of the senior cabin attendant in economy who didnt seem concerned even the video presentation had errors with the actor in the lifevest demonstration blowing across the inflation tubes not into them the food served about an hour after departure was okay not special soon after the trays were cleared away we entered an area of quite strong turbulence the seat belt sign was illuminated and an almost inaudible message alerted passengers but then the sign stayed on for almost 3 hours after the turbulence had ceased naturally passengers ignored the sign and went about the cabin and to the toilets with no concern from the cabin attendants as has been the case for years the inflight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired especially when compared to similar carriers choices are extremely limited while the secondary control on the top of the seat armrest repeatedly changes the volume turns your reading light on or calls the cabin attendant if your rest your arm on it a serious design error approved by vietnam airlines the prelanding snack was a beef pie mine was cold and i asked the senior attendant for a hot one she said nothing took the tray and disappeared soon after the food server in the other aisle saw that i had no meal and gave me a hot pie after another 5 minutes the senior came back with my original pie is this the best vna can do with cabin service oh and like every vna flight ive taken in the past 6 years the unsmiling cabin crew seem to regard their job as boring and a grudging effort vna has the potential to be among the top international carriers in the world but it will take a total attitude turnaround of senior management to achieve this
16065,phuket air,2,phuket air customer review,my friend and i were on the 14th january flight from bangkok to gatwick when the engine caught fire and we had to land back at bangkok what a total nightmare i would urge anyone thinking of using phuket airlines to go with a reputable carrier and to avoid flying with them phuket airlines in my opinion are a total shambles once we had landed back at bangkok airport there was no organisation no explanations just total chaos none of the staff had a clue what was going on and how to handle the situation we heard stories from other passengers about problems they had experienced on the way out as well mechanical problems very long delays etc they are just not equiped to deal with big international flights the reason they are so cheap is because they are so crap the planes are very old and have definitely seen better days dont risk it pay the extra to fly with a decent airline is my advice you will feel safer and more confident and you will get much better service we spent out 400 on a new return ticket as we were not prepared to fly back with them to london the following day 13 hours is a long time to sit and worry whether their old plane will make it or not i know alot of other people on our original flight bought new tickets as well some were on our thai airways flight back to heathrow my friend has since contacted phuket airlines here in the uk to take the matter further but surprisingly they arent being very helpful phuket airlines bunch of cowboys in my opinion
10994,hong kong airlines,7,the crew were extremely nice,the crew were extremely nice the flight was about 4 hours and 5 hours for the flight back to hong kong the flight was really smooth props to the pilots the food was light and average the drinks were cool the in flight entertainment was out of service but pretty sure the airline is on a budget warning that the ticket only includes 7 kg of luggage to take on the plane and have to pay individually for luggage in cargo hold 20 kg round trip more than 800 hkd seat was alright had decent recline trying to avoid flying with hong kong airlines until maybe a few years later when they earn some money back overall above average flight
11887,japan airlines,5,meals were just plain awful,sydney to tokyo narita sadly disappointed by japan airlines while the crews and seating were superb the meals in premium economy and economy were just plain awful i like japanese food very much but except for the udoninthesky snack the meals especially on the sydney to narita leg were disgusting economy meals on japan airlines used to be some of the industrys best these were some of the worst id be happy to pay an extra 100 or more to get a decent set of meals instead of the awful food served on this route on the other hand its fair to say the cabin crew were superb intelligent and efficient in every way the flights were ontime and the aircraft absolutely spotless its great that jal uses the qantas lounge in sydney and this is better than the jal first class lounge at narita where the food has gone downhill also a lot of the staff in there are very officious and made me want to get out as soon as i could
6844,china airlines,9,we recommend this airline,vancouver to bangkok via taipei we took 4 flights in all the service was friendly meals were enjoyable and there was plenty of video entertainment baggage was included in the ticket price the accommodation was comfortable and we recommend this airline
1833,air india,2,the worst flight experience,as an indian national i can tell this is the worst flight experience i ever have seat front tv was not working for the whole flight for all the way for 15 hrs flight the hostess were not friendly and maybe as a indian they dont care about us because we already bought a ticket seats arm rests were all wobbly not fixed
21565,uzbekistan airways,7,crew were pleasant,tashkent to urgench check in for this flight was simple and straight forward at the domestic terminal in tashkent collecting a boarding pass and passing security took less than 10 minutes we were bussed to the plane and boarding was simple and straight forward the 4 crew were pleasant and spoke in 3 languages drop down screens gave the pre flight safety presentation which 20 of the passengers ignored take off was swift and the captain gave a simple on board welcome in 3 languages the cabin crew did not enforce seat belt rule on passengers not using them but quickly stopped a person having lighting up a cigarette cold refreshments coke sprite juice and water where served straight after take off but people in economy walked into the business class section for hot tea the 1 hour flight was in good weather and a low cruising altitude gave good views from the windows the cabin was 3 3 seats and the interior was clean and bright the cabin was a bit like wizz air there was no ife other than drop down screens that played a video of uzbekistan the landing was good and the empty airport was simple to navigate bags arrived within 10 minutes and we were out of the door into the clutchs of taxi drivers
5934,breeze airways,8,most amazing flight attendants,i was really nervous initially due to all the reviews regarding breeze especially the delays and cancellations that people were really upset about i felt the need to leave this review from my personal opinion i flew phx to bradley round trip both flights were exactly on time i also read reviews about the seats being small uncomfortable etc and i was surprised to see what they actually seemed bigger than delta i slept my initial flight but the flight back to phoenix from bradley i had the most amazing flight attendants i was really anxious and the flight seemed to be taking forever so i got up to walk around and went to the back and ask the flight attendant how much longer we had she let me know and asked if theres anything she can do for us she got me and my daughter cups of water and started talking to me for a little bit because i think she knew i was getting really bored she was really really awesome
16212,pobeda airlines,2,an unfriendly airline,flying from moscow to stpetersburg on may 7th my first pobeda experience but flying regularly with easyjet ryanair and wizzair compare to those pobeda seems to be a bit too much low cost in terms of service the boarding started on time and then waiting 30 min in the bus not a nice experience at 6 am seats do not have even any seat pocket so you have to keep your newspapers or anything else on your knees i felt that except of the compulsory safety procedure the main purpose of the cabin crew is to make sure no one is asking for anything absolutely no service offered and no presence in the cabin during the flight price not that attractive given the service flight was on time overall an unfriendly airline
9559,firefly,5,firefly customer review,langkawi to penang bargain price of 24 for 2 pax one way excellent service took of on time and landed 5 minutes early flight time was only 25 mins check in was simple and no hassle about baggage allowance we were a tad over but they didnt charge us plane looked brand new leather seats very comfortable would use again and they can teach some of the british budget airlines a thing or two

3439,airasia x,9,fantastic value for money,bangkok to auckland via kuala lumpur fantastic value for money especially when one finds a promo or random very low fair the food was good and very cheap too as well as the beer bought a warm meal for under 5 and beer was around 3 will be flying this airline over the major carriers when possible after all what do you miss out on free food and drink and an entertainment screen seats are a little cramped but not enough to grumble about really the layover in gold coast is an annoying factor in this leg though not once were my carryon bags checked for weight so could have easily packed more in my luggage
7485,copa airlines,1,absolutely shameful and disgraceful,ill start by saying i really want to like copa the staff is really friendly at airports and on board and they have a wonderful new terminal at pty now operational unfortunately copa has a unique ability to fail to think through their processes related to the new terminal and completely ruin the passenger experience as a result theyve completely snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and my experience which ill relay here is nothing short of orwellian and bizarre having had several subpar experiences at the old terminal t1 i was really looking forward to using the new terminal t2 on this trip ptymdepty the outbound flight from pty was a wonderful opportunity to experience it the terminal is spacious clean modern and efficient everything that the old terminal isnt everything worked well from check in to security passport control and boarding and i was impressed all copa flights depart from the new terminal and everything functioned well i shouldve cautioned my enthusiasm after my departure experience as i had no idea what awaited me on my return on the mdepty return for some odd reason that nobody could explain the copa arrivals came into the old terminal which struck me as odd why would you build a beautiful new terminal and not use it for all of your flights be that as it may the flight arrived at the old terminal and i went down to passport control and got through quickly but when i wound up in baggage claim to collect my bag i was astounded to hear that the copa bags are all delivered to the new terminal so there i was through passport control and in baggage claim and learned i was in the wrong place i had to exit baggage claim make my way to the new terminal via a severely under airconditioned bus or walk in 30 degree heat and rain i finally got to t2 but because the baggage claim area is secure it was not possible to freely enter to collect my bag airport personnel insisted i solicit help from copa to get me inside to get my bag i spoke with about 6 different copa employees and spent approximately 30 minutes gaining access the copa employees were helpful but not terribly sympathetic they told me it was totally my fault blame the customer that i didnt know the bags were to be delivered and collected at t2 despite a t1 arrival in my defense i heard no announcement on board was sent no notification via email or text was told nothing about this when i checked in for the flight was given no piece of paper that explained this in spanish or english there were no copa employees who met the plane at the old terminal to advise us to stay airside to go to t2 to collect our bags and nobody in passport control or baggage claim to explain no screens advising in short there was no communication on behalf of the airline to assist passengers logically any passenger who arrives in one terminal would expect their bag to arrive in the same terminal this logic was completely lost on all airport and airline personnel as i tried to collect my bag i simply cannot understand nor accept that the airline and airport are not at fault by choosing to build a new terminal then not use it force passengers to walk 1 km in the heat to collect their bags at another terminal and then implementing a a scheme that provides zero information about this to passengers at any stage in the process its absolutely shameful and disgraceful in every possible way

20376,thomas cook airlines,7,solid experience on both flights,solid experience on both flights they were punctual and the staff onboard were very approachable and chatty including the captain on the return flight he introduced himself personally in the cabin and was humorous it relaxed everybody the meals were good the airline heavily promotes its collaboration with the chef james martin and this was reflected in some tasty food i would give this category full marks if they were less stingy in the portion sizes and i also think they should make a wine or beer one of the drink options with the meal rather than just tea coffee we are paying extra after all the airlines bag drop facility at manchester is excellent id sent my hold luggage and received my boarding pass within five minutes of entering the terminal also received the luggage in good time upon arrival for both flights a few negatives ife outdated shared screens showing the ubiquitous big bang theory cleanliness the cabin on the return flight was grubby with coffee stains on the backs of seats and used packets of butter on the floor lots of crumbs general stains and dust showed that it had been a while since the plane received a thorough clean the aeroplane on the return flight was newer sharklets and seat spacing was definitely more cramped than on the outbound it seems the airline has tried to squeeze in more seats in its newer models and it became uncomfortable after a while i say this as a man of average height it was also muggy i noticed that the heating controls were set to 22 degrees and thats too warm for squeezedin passengers allinall two decent flights and id fly thomas cook again
5325,bangkok airways,4,check in now by kiosk,bangkok airways no longer has staff to help check in at bangkok airport for domestic flights all check in now by kiosk which dont work well no options for changing flights

17019,royal brunei airlines,5,flew due to cheap costs,dubai to london heathrow no alcohol so take your own flight okay however dont sit near the back of the plane as the crew sit there all night nattering away food pretty poor tv and films were below par due to the amount offered only flew with royal brunei airlines due to cheap costs
16234,porter airlines,2,been nothing but chaos,this airline is a mess i called days prior to our flight to ask questions about baggage and what was allowed and what wasnt i was warned to expect to lose our baggage we arrived to the airport on the day of and everything seemed to go smoothly all the staff on the flight and the flight itself was exceptional however when we arrived to our destination one of our bags were lost 2 days later it arrived we were told we would be called but no one called they just delivered it to the address we provided at the airport on our return flight everything went smoothly at the airport and in the flight again all the flight attendants and the flight itself was great however was delayed slightly when arriving to our home destination we picked up out bags and car seat noticed slight damage to one of the bags and the car seat for my child unfortunately we didnt do a thorough check at the airport our car was waiting and we were in a hurry as our flight was delayed by 40 minutes when i went to put the car seat in the car the car seat was all taken apart i had to take the time to secure it and put it back together in order to use it then when we got home we noticed the other bag was all ripped at the pocket ive tried getting in contact with them and no one answers the phone no one seems to know anything about anything literally its been nothing but chaos their customer service is atrocious outside of the flight itself
5051,avianca,3,uncomfortable and unbelievable experience,this was my first and hopefully last time flying with avianca first off they charge you for any and every snackbeverage inflight even water no matter how long the flight is one leg of our flight was about 6 hours they offer no complimentary refreshments secondly if legroom is a concern of yours i would aim for their highest level of seating which they refer to as premium these are the only seats besides the exit row seats with the most legroom on the plane even their plus seats dont have any extra legroom than economy has my boyfriend is 59 and his knees were uncomfortably touching the seat in front of him lastly on our final leg of the journey from bogota to jfk they made my boyfriend place his duffel bag in the personal item size guide at the gate when it wouldnt fit because something was slightly and i mean slightly because if he actually pushed down a bit on the bag it would have fit poking out they took us to a separate kiosk to try to make us pay 150 i ended up moving one of his items from his bag to my own and that made it fit to me it seemed like they wanted yet another way to make money that theyd charge 150 for a simple fix and if i hadnt moved his items they wouldve actually suckered us into paying it this was the most uncomfortable and unbelievable experience ive had with an airline so far definitely wont be doing it again
16342,qantas airways,3,airline management and equipment poor,excellent crew on all legs food satisfactory airline management and equipment poor network infected with breakdowns delays and cancellations will fly singapore airlines next time
19140,sriwijaya air,7,clean and comfortable,sorong to jayapura flight left almost on time aircraft clean and comfortable with friendly crew and many empty seats at the back inflight meal only a cup of water and a little breadroll
20570,tigerair,7,the good and bad of budget travel,singapore to penang return with tigerair you get to experience the good and bad of modern day budget travel with tigerair having booked a round trip i was able to print my boarding pass and go straight to the gate hence i could skip the long checkin line in the morning bus gate this flight probably due to costcutting and if you happen to be one of the unlucky few who decided to buy a boardmefirst option theyll board you first on the bus and not the plane unsurprisingly departure was delayed due to the need for the bus to loop several times to pick up passengers from the terminal return flight from penang was almost like a travellers heaven flight departed 30 minutes early as everyone had checked in at penang airport comfortably ahead of checkin cut off time it also helped that there was an aerobridge and wellorganised handling agents which meant passengers were all on board in less than 20 minutes arrival in singapore was of course 30 minutes early being a budget airline the service was almost nonexistant cant say that i dont like this airline as theyve performed well on the return leg for me but there is always room for improvement when it comes to departures from changi
12478,jetstar asia,1,i regret my decision every single time,flew from kuala lumpur to singapore never ever fly with jetstar due to connection flight timing i have had to fly jetstar 6 times within the past 6 months and i regret my decision every single time leg room cramped departure late 66 times service sub par regardless of price it is just not worth the headache it is understandable that an airlines flight is late here and there but every single time is just absurd please do yourself a favour and never fly with jetstar asia
21298,tus airways,9,good service and friendly staff,quick flight with good service and friendly staff checkin was efficient aircraft was clean and welcoming only negative was the arrival at a station where bussing brought us back to the terminal rather than an airbridge
14669,meridiana,7,encountered no problems,i flew with my husband and three year old daughter from new jfk to palermo direct round trip we encountered no problems on either leg now we may have been lucky i dont know but flights left on time and arrived on time check in was very easy at both airports luggage was promptly received and cabin crew kind and courteous what i want to explain to travelers is that you cannot expect topnotch luxury service from them while onboard lets be realistic a ticket from jfk to pmo direct cost me 800pp whereas deltaalitalia wanted 1500 to connect in between traveling with a small child i was more than happy to have the direct flight at half the cost it is a nofrills plane i asked for milk and there was none the plane is old but we had no problems there was one tv going to pmo like flying in the old days where you had to watch what was playing on the return there was no tv at all 95 hours without entertainment makes for a long flight the seats in coach are uncomfortable narrow and small so if you are not prepared to deal with that this is not the airline for you food was mediocre no alcohol wine only served with the meal and you got a light snack before landing all in all this airline is good if you can accept nofrills flying the beauty is that you get to palermo direct and at half the cost of the larger carriers would i fly them again probably if the price is right
11477,insel air,7,insel air customer review,curmiacur md82 check in took just a few minutes since i was very early at the airport the checkin staff was helpful however informed me of a delay of minimal 4 hours the pax received a food voucher the flight was fully booked and service on board was great we even got a small meal the return flight was on time and as with the first flight the service on board was great compared to american airlines again a small meal and free beverage service the planes look a bit old from the inside but were very clean
7296,cobalt,9,definitely fly cobalt again,stansted to larnaca i was quite concerned about flying cobalt as i knew there had been serious delays on flights since cobalt took to the skies a few months ago but everything ran really smoothly from checking in at stanstead i arrived in plenty of time and was allowed to check in 3 hours before my flight to boarding and the in flight experience was really good very comfortable seats leather type finish very helpful crew who struggled politely to find space for everyones hand luggage despite a slight 10 minute take off delay we caught up en route and landed on time at larnaca it would maybe have been nice to know which route we were flying over europe to identify landmarks on the way i didnt buy any drinks or snacks as id brought my own this is a no frills flight no entertainment onboard but for the price paid this was excellent value for money and id definitely fly cobalt again i was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to stanstead airport from south london just over an hour and stansted duty free had an amazing variety
19513,swoop,7,legroom was more than i expected,online checkin failed had to check in at airport long line at check in which is typical for a lcc seat pitch left me with one inch of legroom which was more than i expected seats did not tilt flight was delayed by almost an hour after take off many people ran to the front of the plane was not expecting this all seats had inseat power which was nice and unexpected
16087,play,5,my advice is to be prepared,my experience flying to dublin with play was a positive experience i had flown with a similar airline in the past and knew that i had to be prepared to follow the guidelines for baggage precisely and bring any fooddrink that i wanted onboard to avoid additional costs my return flight was not a positive experience it was very stressful and there was almost no communication from play during this stressful time our flight had been delayed and the communication about that delay was confusing or silent the plane was not there at the time we were expected to board and there was no communication between that boarding time and the actual time we would be able to board my group had a connecting flight in reykjavk for 3pm that we realized we would miss but when we asked flight attendants they were unable to answer any questions we did miss our connections flight and the only information we were told was to exit the airport to attend a meeting where we would find out more information this is the situation i am most unsatisfied with exiting the airport felt like a bad idea but that was the direction that was given if you wanted to receive more information when we got to the meeting there was no representative from play only a man from the hotel shuttle service that told us play was going to provide a room for us to stay overnight no other options were presented due to a flight i had to catch in boston for my friends wedding i knew i had to fly out that day so i had to purchase a flight with a different airline and just hope to be refunded since play had told us to exit the airport i missed the next flight to boston because there wasnt enough time to gather my boarding pass and go through tsa luckily i was able to catch the last flight out of reykjavk and everything eventually worked out i received an email that said my flight would be fully refunded and provided with some compensation which i appreciate i would still recommend play because the flight is one of the most affordable options however my advice to anyone choosing this airlines is to be prepared do your research and read the policies closely because you will not be able to communicate with play directly after rebooking the flight with a different airline i spent the next hour or two researching play airlines policies and that helped me feel better about receiving a refund for my flight play did not ever provide the option to rebook a flight with a different airline or that in some cases they will rebook a flight and transport you to the rear by airport the website i used to research policies is here httpsairlinespolicycomcancellationpolicyplayairlinescancellationpolicy i do not recommend calling them customer service hung up twice
22448,volotea,9,very good flight,very good flight cabin crew were very attentioned priority boarding was a good advantage we can follow this flight with volotea wifi on board
20436,thomson airways,4,can not see us traveling on any more thomson long haul,flew thomson airways from manchester to phuket i was really looking forward to my flight my husband is disabled so we phoned to book the disability seats and were told that these seats have good leg room and are close to toilets when we got seated we did find the seats had a bit of extra leg room but we still felt very cramped there does not seem so much space to walk up and down and if the person put their seat all the way back you feel even more cramped we also were not near a toilet that we could use and my husband had to walk all the way back to the back of the plane because the toilet near us was for people that had upgraded only the food was not good with only one hot meal that was very small and i was unable to eat later we were given a ham roll and that was all i asked if i could buy a bottle of water and a shake but was told they do not sell extra drinks on the flight but i was given a small cup of water when they came round with hot drinks i had a coffee but when i asked for sugar and a spoon i was told they had no more onboard both me and my husband are retired and wish to travel but unless i could afford to upgrade my seats i can not see us traveling on any more thomson long haul so it will be europe for us which is a shame because we had a few places we wished to visit but we not not justify the extra cost
9774,flydubai,2,not business class as we know it,not business class as we know it i flew both directions to italy from dubai in business this is a poor experience relative to other business class services seats are limited in recline and safety belts are hugely uncomfortable food is economy and beverage selection is non existence one red one white wine crew unable to make a standard cocktail which is easily done in emirates economy only 3 rows for business so service was fine if sporadic however the destruction of my baggage was an unpleasant experience with my case forced opened and all lock mechanisms broken making the bag worthless the complete denial of all responsibility puts in stark evidence the fly dubai customer focus best advice avoid business class and take one of the most uncomfortable economy seats of any airline and dont what ever you do check in a bag
11319,icelandair,1,nothing good to say here,nothing good to say here one hour layover in keflavik 121822 turned into the 4 days still awaiting reimbursement mid march 2023 airline was completely unhelpful in helping to find accommodations or making our overnight in airport remotely eased for our senior bodies airport staff went out of their way to make it worse paid extra for leg room on every part didnt happen and add an hours delayed flight with med emergency en route and we ended up flying into closest soonest metro airport renting car for return to get home before christmas a travel nightmare still awaiting reimbursement 3 months later
7092,china southern airlines,9,well looked after by the staff,i traveled to auckland with my wife and we were well looked after by the staff they provided extraordinary services from the moment we checked in from guangzhou again a big big thank to the china southern airline staff of their professional services
20251,thai smile airways,8,service was great from every step,the service was great from every step the check in process was easy and the attendant was patient and polite the flight attendants were welcoming and prompt my ticket included checked luggage at no additional charge i will consider thai smile in the future when flying
3027,air transat,6,customer service is hit or miss,we never heard club class being called yet heard they will be calling by groups they called 25 then shortly after added 67 we lined up and while in line my spouse went up to the counter and inquired about club class and the attendant said we did you missed it nothing else so she joined me back in line i mentioned it to the attendant while being greeted coming aboard and she simply well all those people did gesturing to the 8 of the 12 people seated in club class so after paying for club class what was our reward arriving at our seats to find the overhead cabins were unavailable understandable as they are used for staffplane storage acceptable but no alternative immediately available until the gentleman seated next to us offered us space for the extra value spent it was a horrible beginning to a longawaited trip to spain hoping our return trip is much better in todays challenging environment it seems like customer service is hit or miss btw our hostess was cheerful friendly and hospitable something that could be beneficial to the gate counter lead and plane boarding attendant
4850,austrian airlines,2,austrian airlines lost me as a customer,i booked amsterdam to ho chi minh city via vienna and bangkok at austrian airlines the first two flights were operated by austrian airlines and the last part was codeshared with thai smile airways once we arrived at sgn we discovered damage on one of the bags we went to the baggage desk and filled in a form photos of the damage were taken we went on holiday and after returning home i send in a form to austrian airlines i got a case number and then for 6 weeks did not hear a thing when i emailed for a reminder i got a short email back saying i have to go to thai smiles since they caused the damaged also saying austrian is not responsible and austrian refers to their own rules i asked again by email for a proper argument i explained the damage could have occurred at amsterdam vienna or bangkok and that i have a booking with austrian airlines and not thai smile then i got an email saying that they refer to their first answer and that this will be their last communication with me what a rude way to take care of your customers so here i am with a bag 160 which cant be used anymore austrian airlines lost me as a customer
5485,batik air,7,my airline of choice,another good flight with batik i go backwards and forwards between perth and denpasar quite often and batik is still my airline of choice for this route in both instances flights were on time was allocated an exit row on both legs thank you so was very comfortable even though on the way home the aircraft was full cabin crew very helpful and attentive especially on the way home given that the flight was more or less a red eye seats are a little uncomfortable in the lumbar area could probably do with some extra padding but can be ignored for a flight of this duration seat back in front of me was a little bit on the dirty side nothing too bad a lot of passengers seem to miss the fact though that this is not the airlines responsibility it is down to the ground handlers who clean the aircraft during turnaround and down time still a nice baggage allowance with batik as well i sincerely hope that they continue to maintain their operations on this route will be more than happy to fly batik air again
6232,buddha air,7,buddha air customer review,pokhara to kathmandu atr 42 aircraft arrived at the airport to find out my flight was over an hour late but as i was early i asked if i could be put onto the earlier flight which ended up taking off 15 minutes after the flight i had booked the previous day i had tried to change to an earlier flight and was told that they were all full festival time strangely there were at least six free seats on the plane so i dont know why they didnt rebook other passengers clearly you have to ask its the same plane going back and forth so more susceptible to delays than others like simrik that were using two beechcraft planes that were half the size of buddha airs this also means that you can arrive at the airport see your plane but if its an hour later you have to wait for it to go to kathmandu and back before its your turn sweets for takeoff water inflight which was nice served in a 20 minute window most importantly it felt safe the cabin attendants were attentive to this its expensive as the price is fixed for all airlines on the route but rescheduling is free of charge depending on availability even multiple times the himalayas are the inflight entertainment stunning
8747,emirates,4,it was very disappointing,first time flying business class with emirates and it was very disappointing a very early preboarding process in amsterdam while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned so 500 people squeezed into a waiting area for an hour boarding is messy boarding music is terrible and if delayed played on repeat for hours the seat is quite nice the crew works very hard but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays stuff stacked on top of each other meal service starts 2 hours after take off on the way back used the business lounge in dubai it is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have including most european airlines again delayed gipsy king music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding poorly informed by the captain and mixedcontradicting info from the cabin crew all the purser could say that it wasnt their fault overall all facilities and procedures are quite average food and drinks are ok drinks actually very nice crew was a mix of friendly hardworking people and some who couldnt care less
2395,air moldova,3,air moldova customer review,flew air moldova on the chisinau london stansted route checkin efficient and quick boarding the airbus 320 was in good condition and crew very welcoming once onboard offered a cold meal and one round of drinks air moldova makes a technical stop in paris to dropoff and pickup passengers on this route given that total flight time to london including the stop in paris is over 5 hours i think it does make sense to serve a hot meal and at least another round of drinks i guess this was the only disappointment with air moldova
8055,dniproavia,7,dniproavia customer review,kivkbpods both flights were codeshared with aerosvit but operated by dniproavia planes kivkbp embraer 145 that has seen better days kbpods plane was an oldlooking boeing 737500 service onboard was good offered drinks and a double sandwich despite both flights being under 1hr flights departed on time they almost lost my luggage on the first flight as it was sent to connecting flights but were able to locate it relatively quickly and hand it back overall a relatively good experience for the price paid
14129,lufthansa,4,lacking the premium experience,any longer flights will no longer be done with lufthansa they are charging premium prices but lacking the premium experience the food was terrible the seats were cramped and uncomfortable wifi came at a premium even for messages only many of the changes made by lufthansa over the years remind me of budget airlines like easy jet the very reason i flew with lufthansa was the more premium experience such as being able to choose a seat on checkin free of charge ironically the flight to san francisco our first stop on a road trip was with united who had great food very generous service and comfortable seats its sad seeing whats happened to this once great airline
16149,play,5,30hr delay,30hr delay followed by a gate change after everyone already started to enter the gate then after we landed their was a 30 min wait on the ground due to miscommunication with air traffic control
22941,xiamen airlines,3,try to avoid xiamen airlines,beijing to fuzhou and the experience is not good at all it disappointed me a lot i have to admit the food beverage are decent but i got cold before the flight so i tried to ask for a blanket from the cabin crew the lady was not so nice and showed obvious impatience for such normal request she told me she will remember but she never got back to me the ac was strong and i had to suffer it for 3hrsif possible i will try to avoid xiamen airlines and also not recommend my friends to take it
190,aegean airlines,3,45 mins connection window,zero arrangements for connection flights my aegean flight came 30 mins late and i only had a 45 mins connection window to catch my flight to thessaloniki with olympic air no one made sure they waited for us the boarding gate was across the airport so i was running for 15 mins had all my papers covid pass and pfl checked before departure yet they checked passports with another security check in control despite not leaving the airport at the end my hand luggage was taken at the plane baggage section because there was no space upstairs think about connection flights
16718,regional express,5,delayed nearly 3 hours,regional express flight from albury to sydney delayed nearly 3 hours we were notified 45 mins before planned departure however not the reason if this was a mechanical delay then its reasonable to expect that if it is fixed early we can board early so we continued to the airport however on arrival we find it is a crew rest delay so there is a fixed time delay which passengers should be notified about so that they dont have to wait in the airport while the crew sleeps
10070,french bee,7,very nice crew,san francisco to paris got to the airport 3 hours early and when the counter opened i checked my bag and even though a little over on weight said it was not a problem the seating was tight but not nasty small im 511 and weigh 210lbs plane was new and clean with no nasty odors all seats had a small blue blanket in plastic packaging the inflight entertainment was good with menu choices from using your laptopphone to output video on your screen to cameras on the nose and tail to see where you are going to a choice of about 30 movies plus a few tv programs still not too shabby for the 18000 seat price you also can order duty free stuff and also munchies from the video screen menu chips are 2 eu and you can buy 2 small bottles of jack daniels and 2 chips for 1000 but no different from other airlines these days the flight was good and bathrooms were clean the cabin crew spoke mostly french but were fine by the end of 11 hours the seats were feeling a little bit hard just keep in mind that i think most folks miss especially those who have flown to europe before this is not a 2000 flight its basically a nice clean seat on a bus bring snacks or a sandwich with you along with a neck pillow i even had the chance to talk to the flight crew including the pilot who was from madrid very nice crew
12103,jet2com,7,the crew on board were extremely nice,had a return flight from rome to manchester the seats were very nice covered in leather and had a lot of legroom the seat was comfortable and the crew on board were extremely nice however the window blind could not be shut so i had the sun in my face the whole time it was slightly distracting but i could live with it
1307,air canada rouge,5,very disappointed,toronto to venice no tv or inseat entertainment poor meals for me clogged sink in the restroom small space for luggage i was expecting more i am very disappointed definitely will try to avoid flying with air canada rouge in the future
22134,vivaaerobs,8,our experience went better than expected,i was a bit sceptical to purchase tickets based on reviews but our experience went better than expected i decided to leave a review because it seems like people only review when things go bad we had a flight from nyc to cdmx and then to oaxaca and both flights were ontime and smooth checkin was smooth and checked luggage was received quickly the cabin crew staff were very nice also we enjoyed our flight obviously you pay for what you get the seats dont recline theyre not as cushioned as other airlines and you have to pay for food and drinks my partner and i were aware of this so we prepared accordingly if youre looking for an airline to get you to point a to point b safely then viva is your goto if your looking for more comfort then go with another airline
20796,transaero airlines,6,transaero airlines customer review,holiday flight from moscow dme to lisbon paid eur 750 for a return ticket which is far too much for what you get transaero has a separate checkin zone in domodedovo and flights to europe have dedicated check in counters though there is no indication of it whatsoever i saw people flying to astana queuing in front of me were refused checkin and had to queue again at another counter boarding started on time then there was a very long bus ride to the remote part of the airport after boarding a 1hr delay was announced as the purser explained due to bad weather in dme from my window i could see planes taking off and landing onboard the legroom was very good much larger than usual in economy staff reasonably friendly food served was not tasty but filling the selection was beef or chicken there was no inflight entertainment the return flight was on time with exactly the same features onboard
9689,fly540com,8,fly540com customer review,nairobi to malindi and malindi to lamu both returns we found them to be quite efficient and helpful for an african airline they did however cancel our return flight from lamu but did send out a search party to find us on the island for us to catch an alternativeearlier flight timings were good with no delays in fact one flight left 40 mins early i would have no hesitation in recommending fly540 based on our experience aircraft a bit old but clean
2717,air serbia,2,worst airline ever,worst airline ever they lie about special offers they delayed our return flight for 24h and we got just some generic message no explanation nothing they left us with our 3 year old child and when we complained that we dont have any more accommodation they didnt care never again with them
18092,silkair,7,nothing special but did the job,singapore to penang first time on silkair so did not know what to expect given the limited reviews check in was t2 and used the krisflyer lounge in t2 which is nowhere near as good as the lounge in t3 flight was only about 55 minutes cabin crew do not have the same skills or level of service as that of singapore airlines after the crew serve the meal they are more interested in talking to each other than attending to the passengers seats comfortable nothing special but did the job
2133,air malta,3,my bag was confiscated,at the checkin in vienna the clerk called air malta to check if i could travel with my sailing life jacket which contains a 22g co2 cartridge he confirmed that air malta granted permission for this i then asked the checkin clerk to confirm with the captain that this was ok he came back to me say that the captain had given his permission i flew to malta and my bag was not on the conveyor on arrival i found out two days later by sending my wife to vienna airport that security in vienna found the co2 cartridge and asked air malta if they can release it air malta declined and my bag was confiscated my wife managed to access the bag and after removing my life jacket the bag was flown to malta not only did air malta not honour their agreement to carry my bag but they did not inform me of what had happened to make things worse after trying more than 30 times all day in fact to call air malta i did not succeed in getting any information i was never informed as to what had happened without sending someone to vienna airport at great inconvenience i would never have known what happened to my bag
16415,qantas airways,2,dissatisfied with the lack of service,the cabin service and the meal was poor as well as being inconsiderate to the person sitting beside me firstly the usual glass of wine was not available on departure they ran out of meal choice when they reached my row the person beside was an elderly woman of her way home to scotland she did not like the noodles that were the only offer as the meal she asked for an alternative an economy class meal was offered it had not arrived after about an hour at this point my elderly neighbour gave up and told the steward she no longer wanted the meal the manager then came as the woman complained about the lack of service the manager talked down to the elderly woman telling her you dont always get the meal you want the woman was continuing on from brisbane on an emirates flight to scotland she tells me she flies business class every year to new zealand she was happy to know that her next trip later this year will not require a flight on qantas as emirates will be flying all the way to nz i very rarely fly qantas choosing other airlines it is only out of necessity will i consider them again their treatment of this elderly woman was appalling and i was also dissatisfied with the lack of service and poor quality of the meal
2965,air tahiti nui,8,air tahiti nui customer review,laxpptlax over christmas and new year both trips were redeyes outbound from lax checkin was cheerful and set the tone for the journey on the down side passengers are bussed to the aircraft and atn staff lost complete control of the process resulting in a scrum to get on the busses onboard we passed on the meal offering and slept the hot breakfast was welcome arrivals hall was chaos and a 1 hour delay to get through immigration awaited us returning the departures area is new spacious but very warm boarding went well as our seats were in row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at lax once again pleasant and efficient crew in summary our flights were good the only warning i would make is that in economy the seat pitch is only 31 inches and on an 8 hour flight if you are over 6 ft tall this is not comfortable at all
1039,air berlin,1,reserved seat was ignored,frankfurt to palma de mallorca reserved seat was ignored it looks not unusual my family booked 4 seat together beforehand in website but boading pass we got in airport forced us to seat far location each other one lady kindly changed her seat for my son 8 years old to my next seat she was forced to seat separately with her husband instead my wife and daughter 11 years old are forced to seat one by one separately
19683,tam airlines,1,i was impressed,tam airlines is the only form of transportation i have come across in brasil that is on time i was impressed when i checked in and was transferred to an earlier flight that was already boarding i was impressed at the efficiency i boarded the earlier flight and was surprised that my luggage came on the same flight they also had an english speaker so i didnt have to struggle with my portuguese in explaining the situation
12308,jetstar airways,2,no idea of customer service,check in terrible rude and no idea of customer service 3 hours delay to to staffing management issues good to get a refreshment voucher but dont appreciate the manner of rude talking to customers
18592,smartwings,8,overall a good impression,return charter flight with smartwings prg rmf 14 days earlier was on a320 arrived exactly on time in prague no entertainment but the route display was informative does not feel like a budget airline aircraft was clean and well presented small tasty hot meal and soft drink provided free others for sale coffee nescafe was nice and strong and provided with a small biscuit cabin service was efficient and friendly despite the early morning start overall a good impression
1521,air dolomiti,7,air dolomiti customer review,flights both to venice and from venice were fine on time and relatively uncomplicated however it angered us that our carryon bags that were by lufthansa standards dimensions and weight had to be checked on the return flight to munich yet fit perfectly on our flight from munich to venice two weeks earlier if you have carryon guidelines and people follow them they should never be told that they must have to check them a carryon bag should be just that one that you can bring on the plane
8032,delta air lines,4,the second bag is still in naples,my wife and i were returning from a long delayed vacation we splurged on first class flights our flight was supposed to leave naples italy at 0610 air france sent a heavy aircraft to naples that had problems getting back out as a result we missed our connecting flight in paris also an air france flight by about 15 minutes we were rebooked on a delta flight 5 hours later when we arrived in atlanta on delta flight 085 our checked bags were not on it we contacted baggage services and they told us the bags were in paris and would be put on a flight the next day and we would have them by 9 pm we made it clear that the bags contained prescription medication that we needed the next day neither bag showed up despite repeated attempts to track them using deltas online system at 915 pm we were told that the bags would be coming in the next day today at 1000 today we found one bag loaded onto an alitalia flight from naples they never made it to paris to begin with and that it would be transferred to a flight to atlanta today the second bag is still in naples and no one at delta can do anything to get it moving they pass it off as the baggage handlers problem not deltas
8547,egyptair,2,nofrills low cost,egyptair business class ms768 barcelona to cairo was bad the seat was old and uncomfortable it barely reclined and the footrest did not work the entertainment system on my chair didnt work i had to change seats and even then the sound had a hissing buzz and the screen so small that it was impossible to read or enjoy a movie i asked for a seafood meal and i received a salad with four pieces of lettuce two pieces of bread fish and some fruits overall the meal was disappointing but the fish fresher than normal on the same flight the cost of the ticket is disproportionately steep because of the monopoly that the company has on the route given the vintage condition of the carrier it should be priced as a nofrills low cost
1620,air europa,5,chaos during check in,chaos during check in poorly designed check in area the airline asks you to download all documents to their website covid test vaccination certificate attestation you get a boarding pass but when you arrive to terminal 1 the business class agent has no idea about this process he did not even have a computer luggage check in was smooth priority lane for security unpleasant and slow boeing 787 cabin with 1 21 lie flat seats nice staff cabin overheated only 1 wc available
23170,zipair,1,lost all of our money with no refund,they lied about connection in narita and we lost all of our money with no refund they have no agreements with any connecting airlines to transfer you once in narita hence they denied boarding and did not offer a refund nor did they advise of such at purchase lost 1000 with this airline
7216,cityjet,1,cityjet customer review,wx71 22122014 and wx88 on 29122014 complimentary snacks drinks and delicious chocolate bonbons were served by friendly attentive flight attendants making the cityjet flights operated by vlm a very enjoyable experience also no queries about carryon luggage or charges for checked luggage a rarity these days i would certainly recommend cityjet to those who appreciate hasslefree flying
2517,air new zealand,1,friendliness of the crew,this was a code share with singapore airlines from paris to auckland and on the return auckland to singapore leg sia booked me on air nz after flying 2 legs in singapore airlines premium economy the air nz seating was vastly superior both comfort and space same 242 seating but in each row of middle four there was one seat empty so the configuration in the middle was actually 12 after reading so much bad press about air nz it was a surprise that the cabin crew made a huge effort to walk around the premium economy cabin and introduce themselves to each passenger by name there was also a hot towel but what made the air nz premium product vastly superior was the friendliness of the crew they made an effort to replenish drinks and chat to customers and provided excellent service now the management of air nz need to catch up with their crew and improve their eu website which is a disaster i actually tried to book this trip on air nz but the website was useless
16237,porter airlines,3,cancelled 3 flights in 8 days,mar 3 they cancelled flight pd2286 from halifax to toronto due to a coming storm in toronto but because they did that they also cancelled flight pd2283 from tor to hal leaving 5 hours earlier 1255pm from toronto with clear skies in both cities this was to avoid having the plane stay in halifax overnight this cost 80 passengers stranded in tor about 200 night for hotels food cabs etc i estimate 80people x200night16000 and porter didnt give a cent and saved the cost of 2 flight by booking us passengers on scheduled flights the next day the canada transportation agency only requires them to state the circumstances were unavoidable to get away with restitution to their customers what a sleazy move they have also cancelled 3 flights in 8 days from halifax all at 5pm departure
5106,azerbaijan airlines,6,food was tasty and pleasant,this was my first time with azerbaijan airlines flying from dubai to london heathrow via baku and i was pleasantly surprised all the usual expectations of an airline on long haul reclining seats variety of tv channels films ok my wifes didnt work but she had her book anyway etc the food was tasty and pleasant staff seemed helpful and friendly but to date 5 weeks later we are still no further sorting the apd refund that is due following the uk chancellors decision to scrap apds for u16s my son and stating refunds from airlines would be refunded well azerbaijan airlines to date dont seem to want to know
17016,royal brunei airlines,8,good deal if you have flexible plans,melbourne to london via brunei and dubai the deal with flying royal brunei is more complicated than flying other airlines the flying experience on the 787 is excellent great legroom for an economy seat good food served every flight ife is ok take your own headphones crew are very good the price is very low compared to other airlines however this is a small airline with no back up plan if things go wrong and they do we had a 13 hour delay in brunei but met people who were delayed several days rb put us into a basic 3 star hotel for the night and organised a pretty poor evening meal but a meal nontheless we also travelled with people who had experienced this sort of delay several times rb is a good deal if you have flexible plans delays in brunei especially are not uncommon but not that hard to deal with if you do not have to be somewhere at a particular time the extra night in brunei helped with jet lag but wasnt really in or plans
13396,lan peru,5,lan peru customer review,return to flights from lima to arequipa in the last few months and one return flight from lima to cusco aircraft are clean and staff helpful when leaving from lima it is recommended to check in on line and print your boarding pass because the queue for baggage drop off is very short while queue to check in always seems very long only comment is that the same snack is served on every flight regardless of the time of day tiny muffins mini bread sticks and a chocolate however prices are cheap if you book ahead of time
8104,dragonair,5,dragonair customer review,pvghkg return connect tofrom cx longhaul flight with a330300 clean and well maintained both ways delayed more than 1hr and bussed tofrom main terminal caused huge inconvenience as i had connect flight tofrom cx long haul nowadays ka still provide meal service but the portion is very tiny even chinese domestic airlines has better quality food avod on a330300 is very good
19093,srilankan airlines,8,cabin crew is very pleasant and helpful,heathrow to colombo seat numbers 36a and 36c the cabin crew is very pleasant and helpful the screen was not working in 36a and cabin crew tried a lot to sort out the issue it came once after their several attempts and then it didnt work consistently but greatly appreciate the effort that they put and it was something out of their control also they gave a nice service and other members in the crew was willing to help for anything we requested food was ok though it was a fixed menu for veg and non veg would like to propose more ppi kind of apron that they can use and throw away after each service to the crew in this pandemic cleaning of the table is not acceptable
19712,tam airlines,2,tam airlines customer review,grueze jj8000 airbus a330200 i always flew tam and they always provided a decent service and acceptable coach class seat comfort but the last time they were able to transform a 25 hours flight in a nightmare it was an early morning flight and my seat was 35k the interesting thing is i had flown in the very same seat in the very same plane ptmvp one year earlier from gru to mia and it was a pleasant flight but this time they refurbished the interior and had shrunk the space between coach seats i couldnt find a nice position to relax myself even it being a 25 hours flight the catering was ridiculous just a very small cold tasteless ham and cheese sandwich a lot worse than they use to serve on sao paulorio de janeiro shuttle service the flight attendant told me it was an early morning flight and called that stuff breakfast and told me the food in night flights on that route was a lot better i took the night flight to come back and they gave the same small cold and tasteless sandwich for the price they put in the ticket it should be a lot better coach class used to be good but lately its a nightmare not only at tam but on all airlines i have flown
12840,kenya airways,3,the worst experience i have ever had,cape town to mumbai via nairobi i have taken loads of flights in the last few years all across the world and this is by far the worst experience i have ever had our flight was delayed for over 10 hours because there was no crew availability because of that our connecting flight was missed and we were rescheduled to a flight which made us reach mumbai 25 hours late when we reached the airport the system was not working and we were given hand written boarding passes the process delayed the flight by more than 4 more hours the airline staff were clueless as they apparently said that the head office in nairobi was not picking their calls i dont know what is up with kenya airways its better to cancel the trip than to travel with them
7628,corsair,3,corsair customer review,yulcdg first at checkin i had to wait but staff were friendly vip lounge crowded lots of food choice drinks and computers available was not hungry but soup cheese sandwiches all available boarding was chaotic they asked families with children first and business passengers to follow what an awful experience had to queue for a long time after children very old 747 cabin and plane staff in classe grand large friendly nice ife system with many choices of movies but we had little space food was tasteless and i wanted to sleep baggage delivery was quick corsair needs to update the planes and the classe grand large
8829,ethiopian airlines,9,a very enjoyable flight,this was the first time i used this airline and it was one of the best airlines i have flown with staff very good and helpful clean aircraft and was on time there and back a very enjoyable flight and will be using them again
15177,norse atlantic airways,3,my bag was too large,i booked two norse airlines flights and it is doubtful that i will ever be booking another one a great budget airline if nothing goes wrong however any complaint will go unresolved my flight from nyc to london gatwick was all right you can only receive your official norse boarding pass 23 hours before your flight actually arrives so expect to be waiting in yet another line at the airport the movie selection changes often and is lackluster compared to most other airlines to their credit they are a budget airline if youre flying norse the goal is to get from point a to point b as cheaply as possible at least that was my goal and it was going great that is until i tried to fly from berlin to my home country of the united states heres where my real complaint begins at norse you are at the mercy of the employee who gives you your official boarding pass if something goes wrong youre on your own because they have very few staff members to help you after waiting in the norse line for 1 hour they finally began signaling for prospective passengers to receive boarding passes unfortunately i approached the most unfriendly woman i have met in my entire life and i worked in food service for 2 years from the beginning she was impatient and rude rolling her eyes when i asked simple questions and asked if she spoke english then she proceeded to claim that my bag was too large to count as a personal item i was backpacking in europe for 22 days and boarded multiple flights using budget airlines like easyjet and ryanair my backpack fit in all personal item containers including the norse airlines container from nyc to london gatwick it is also worth mentioning that all 3 of my travel companions with the same size backpacks were met with norse employees who happily provided them with personal item tags this service worker charged me 65 and classified my bag as a carryon item it also fit underneath my seat on the flight when asked for her employee id number so i could file a complaint she declined
8110,dragonair,4,dragonair customer review,hkgpek in business two hour delay at hkg passengers have been told because late arrival of the aircraft but ka is based in hkg surely ka could reorganise the aircraft better business lounge the pier close to gate 64 is pretty average qantas business class is so much better boarding process was pretty average staff made announcement of boarding but did not board anyone until 15 minutes later inflight service was pretty bad for business class crew did not clean away the predeparture water glass and wet towel until dinner was served the cabin lights turned off before dinner items were cleaned it was bad service for a business class for any airline on a positive note ka finally has personal entertaining system in business class the seat is also better than the old one
11738,ita airways,6,very cramped seat pitch,both legs with aircraft still in alitalia livery good safety procedures and good crew very cramped seat pitch unacceptable also for one hour flight free light and hot drinks they need a makeover but all in all not so bad
15051,nok air,6,everything about the flight was low cost,the cheerful canary yellow uniforms of the flight crew are matched by the livery of their aircraft if only the happiness went into their attitude as well yes they are a lowcost carrier and i am sure the crew doesnt have the same work environment as the crews of higherend airlines but that is no justification for a bad attitude everything about the flight was low cost they have so much potential at least they had a skybridge at dmk and hkt
16458,qantaslink,8,sandwich would be preferable,adelaide to brisbane checked in onlineonly hand luggage so quick process at adelaide airport flight due to depart at 1620 but delayed by about 1 hour seat 19c aisle on 2 seat configuration but unlike my flight down to adelaide with empty seat next to me this was a full flight snack was celery carrot sticks with a dip to be honest not really worth having the extra work cabin crew do to serve im sure a packaged sandwich would be preferable on the flight with the cold drinks served we were kept informed of flight altitude of 23000 ft and slower time taking to eventually touch down at approx 1925pm during flight cabin crew kept busy due to enquiries about connecting flights although arrival over 1 hour late arrived safely
19462,swoop,2,9 hour flight delay,9 hour flight delay without any explanation or notification had to sit in the airport and wait all day could not speak to anyone from swoop and online chat said someone would respond within 48 hrs brutal
15997,philippine airlines,8,would fly them again,not sure what to expect because of the reviews i have read about them but since i have a voucher from a cancelled flight thought of giving it a try check in is very long at the time which is no surprise the a330300 though old is very clean seats are comfortable ife is at par with other carriers meals were fantastic overall the service for this 8hr flight was very good like the fact as well that i flew nonstop instead of connecting would fly them again and recommend
15818,pegasus airlines,1,they ruined my entire vacation,the worst airline in the world 2 weeks ago i was flying with them my luggage was lost i had in my luggage the medications necessary for my life because im chronically ill moreover in my suitcase i had the things necessary for my work because of their lack i incur material losses they ignore emails ive been calling them for a week they expose me to the costs of making calls abroad my suitcase still hasnt arrived although they promised to send it 72 hours after it went missing and arrive at the hotel within the next 2 days 16 days have passed and the suitcases are still gone they ruined my entire vacation
7942,cyprus airways,7,satisfied with this airline,larnaca to athens a small airline yet efficient in my case the plane was clean seating was very comfortable we had a great welcome from the attendants though i cannot comment on inflight service since i had none if you need something you have to pay for it flight was smooth and arrived ahead of schedule with a captain that kept us posted on our flight on the negative side their in flight magazine in only english and not in greek as well probably only for english speaking passengers i was fully satisfied with this airline
20205,thai smile airways,9,happy with their crews,i always fly with thai airways or thai smile i trust and happy with their crews and the service is excellent also we have benefits of frequently flight to be able to redeem or upgrade my next flight
17816,sereneair,8,experience has been good,karachi to quetta had been travelling by sereneair for over 2 years and the experience has been good this time as well flight was on time breakfast was fine aircraft is more spacious than pias a320s staff was courteous
22545,vueling airlines,5,everything was fine,i approached this flight with skepticism since i have had bad experiences with vueling in the past but apart from little leg space everything was fine the flight was on time drinks and food for purchase average for low budget carriers and staff were nice and attentive so will consider them perhaps again in the future
1283,air canada rouge,7,good value for money,we were on holiday visiting both toronto and las vegas its not often you get to fly on a 767 in europe anymore and i was looking forward to this trip on one even though i know they are showing their age the airport in toronto was efficient and relatively quiet and it was good that we could do the us immigration preclearance there boarding was quite fast given the number of people but after we boarded the cabin crew had to work very hard to find hold space for all of the carryon bags which led to frustrated passengers and the plane was uncomfortably hot while all this was going on the 767 did look old and a bit tatty but actually my seat was comfortably and i nodded off and before long we were in vegas i thought the flight was good value for money given the distance we were covering nearly 2000 miles i think baggage arrived quickly in vegas airport too
17040,royal brunei airlines,8,a nice way to fly,i flew with royal brunei on their boeing 787 in aprilmay this year to london from new zealand the seats no more comfortable than any other airline but the leg room was good the food was very nice and no complaints there the matter of no alcohol was not a problem with the price from royal brunei i think this airline makes it a nice way to fly to london
5073,avior airlines,3,avior airlines customer review,blaccs avior are basic but no worse than many european budget airlines seats are small but the flight from barcelona to caracas is only 3040 minutes so not much time to feel uncomfortable and there is a free drinks service even on this short flight theres no real reason not to fly avior however the checkin luggage maximum is only 20 kgs so if carrying a heavy suitcase you may prefer flying conviasa 30 kgs which is usually a little more expensive but allows more luggage and is usually somewhat more comfortable too
1814,air india,2,seat was completely broken,we had a flight ai127 from new delhi to chicago on june 2023 i was accompanied with my 5 year old daughter my daughter was super excited to go to usa and she said i will watch tv and play games to kill the time since she is not comfortable with long travel our seat number was good to our shock the seat was completely broken no headphones were working the touch was off and the button to adjust the seat was also broken so just imagine how does it feel when you are told that you have to sit in upright position for next 14 hours i am taking air india off my list now never ever travelling back in air india again we complained to the air hostess she said yeah cant help it i will reboot the system there might be some technical glitch or let me find some other seat for you but she did not do anything i felt like jumping off the flight my daughter was crying for the screen to play some games but i was so helpless air hostess doesnt have a smiley face they were in a angry face and we couldnt feel to ask anything if we need
35,adria airways,3,never flying them again,adria airways flight from pristina to munich was smooth return flight was terrible get notified flight is delayed can see it on tarmac told there is a technical issue and we will fly to ljubljana slovenia for a connecting flight reality the flight was half full and we were forced onto another adria flight so they could save a buck our recompense a free meal at airport never flying with them again when lufthansa reps tell you this always happens it should be a sign
7626,corsair,9,corsair customer review,first time on this airline was quite hesitant at first but price was too good to let go flew from montreal to paris and back on 747 checked in luggage and had a carry on on the way to paris sat on upper deck on the way back lower deck far back on an aisle seat both flights on time paris flight was actually early no trouble with luggage food was decent with excellent staff overall very nice experience would definitely recommend
17821,shaheen air,9,cabin crew friendly,i flew with shaheen air on 18 jan 2016 from dubai to karachi checkin was good cabin crew friendly and smiling and before take off a drink was served and a newspaper after take off nice dinner was served with chicken korma zeera rice riata and hot tea
7232,cityjet,3,cityjet customer review,flew from cambridge to dublin outbound was great however when i went to check in for return flight from dublin i was greeted with you know this flight has been cancelled dont you when i pointed out that the flight was still showing on departure board i found out it had only been cancelled within the last 15 minutes we were put on flight to london city and then transferred by cab to cambridge 3 hours late cityjet have so far not responded to my request for a callback i received an email thanking me for my detailed comments which i havent sent and thanking me for my feedback which again i never provided pity really because i would have recommended cityjet were it not for the appalling customer service
18391,sky express airlines,5,i paid 4 euro for priority luggage,the flight delay 30 min and any of the ground staff inform us also was overbooked that means some of the passengers flown on the next flight i paid 4 euro for priority luggage at kalymnos and was the last luggage that came the cabin crew was very nice and friendly there wasnt variety on the aircraft only a biscuit and water of coffee for 1 hour flight
10369,germanwings,2,no info or staff,bad arrangements if outside the protocol there were heavy fog in london and due to weather condition flight is cancelled reasonable but only one number that can never be connected is given to rebook germanwings flights or claim hotel accommodation it is fine that the hotel flights needed to be rebooked but no instruction of how to claim those back flight booked again at the same time 715pm to berlin and was delayed to 930pm no info or staff until the monitor suddenly show the gate numbe at 840 flight delayed so no public transport out of tegel airport for berlin city center no arrangement at all need to get a cab to hotel around 1am so a lot of money like 500 pounds was paid for everything but no way to get it back only good thing is staff are nice

11874,japan airlines,7,staff very attentive,lots to like about this flight but are few negative points the good great value as purchased 9 months in advance and travel was at easter excellent checkin lounge given ow status boarding was efficient and on time departure midnight departure so snack bag and water given less than 10 mins after seat belt sign off letting everyone get to sleep minimal announcements and big breakfast served 25 hours before arrival leg room great toilets always clean staff very attentive the improvements seat base is thin and while leg room great i found the seat thin and uncomfortable toilets 3 shared amongst 150 economy and premium economy pax so while clean there was always a line movie range was a bit limited great system but minimal new movies overall still a great way to get to japan from melbourne leave at midnight and arrive at 9am no time lost wifi while active was never strong enough to do anything

6955,china eastern airlines,3,wheel chair assistance not provided,delhi to brisbane via shanghai the requested wheel chair assistance was not provided in new delhi airport in shanghai airport we got wheel chair after a long wait the wheel chair assistant was highly impolite and very very rude person cant expect someone like him working at an international airport where people from different nationalities commute at the time of boarding at shanghai airport it was raining heavily and staircase to the aircraft was uncovered causing the passengers to get wet

14709,meridiana,3,meridiana customer review,disgraceful to tell people with children and babies to check in two hours before a flight to keep them waiting one hour for staff to turn up which ultimately delayed the flight found meridiana staff disinterested in passengers and more concerned with how they were looking in as much as they allowed the passenger sitting outside of me to keep two large bags at her feet which made it almost impossible for me to get out this happened on our flight to florence and back to gatwick where this practise seemed the norm curtains used to divide classes were not drawn back before landing and the passenger in front of me was not reminded to bring his seat upright on landing we have travelled worldwide for many years and this has to be the worst flight we have ever taken staff need retraining in air safety and people skills
19655,tam airlines,7,staff were extremely friendly,on our flight with lan we had to change flights in sao paulo to tam airlines retrieve our luggage and check it in again as we were flying a domestic flight to rio and then to santiago there wasnt much time between the connections in sao paulo and going through immigration and changing terminals made it almost impossible with 30 minutes before departure we didnt have our luggages checked in and there was a big line at the counter the staff on ground made a great job in checking our baggage and then taking us to the plane in a minibus as we were the last ones to board the luggage arrived safe in santiago and both flights were on time on the way to rio there was a new a319 with lots of leg room and for santiago an old a320 which gave us a lotof trouble with many turbulences the food served on tam wasnt different from the one of lan but the staff were extremely friendly still the experience in sao paulo looked very chaotic to us and we would prefer lan for further flights
8264,easyjet,1,easyjet left us stranded abroad,easyjet left us stranded abroad twice with no money food clothing hotel or way home they turned off all methods of communication didnt answer phone lines and put the phone down on customers they have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back which they will then deny they have cost us thousands and havent been in touch with us at all theyve even blocked our social media comments we were supposed to return to the uk on the 23rd from croatia and so we headed to the airport for our flight from split to manchester we sat for hours in the airport and noted delay after delay during the delays we received no updates from staff only learning of delays from the easyjet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water its suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway duty free was incredibly expensive and limited as were the facilities we sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication easyjet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance the flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement you were left to rebook the flights through the ej app there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket the next direct flights werent for days and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across europe amsterdam milan rome etc and not only were they with huge layovers there were not enough seats on any of them and also experienced the problem of being during the following days our smaller group had taken the croatia to milan connecting flight option as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the uk earlier we were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the uk and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise rather than days so we were left with little choice as there was no contact from easyjet and the staff were unhelpful we also had to find a hotel at 1130pm at night and then also find a way to get to it due to the timings we had no food or water and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us we had to keep our morning flight to milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies we did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyjet to resolve first so they cannot and would not help we went through the airport as normal the next day and boarded our flight we were told our flight was full and therefore only 4 of us out of our group of 8 managed to make it on this flight
11672,israir airlines,1,israir airlines customer review,rometel aviv everything about the trip was a pleasure the plane left almost on time 20 mins later than scheduled but this was already viewable 12 hrs before the flight needless to say we arrived on time considering we flew from midnight until 330 am rome time we assumed we would get very little if at all in the way of snacks wrong almost immediately each person received a bottle of water this was followed by a choice of a salad or a quite hefty sandwich finally they served tea and coffee and this in a 3hr flight the staff were courteous and effective making the flight a really enjoyable one
19669,tam airlines,4,service dismal and uninterested,miami to san paulo with tam airlines chaotic boarding at miami every single passenger had three and four carry on items and nobody could care less thus ensued discussions some strong among passengers over bin space crew could not have cared less delayed departure due to catering issue and subsequent delayed arrival ife was not working all the time had to be rebooted service dismal and uninterested the food was acceptable drinks difficult to get refilled not impressed even though i have flown other tam flights and have enjoyed them not this one
9833,flynas,2,such lack of service,left cairo ok on arrival at riyadh at approx 7pm once on wifi a reminder email arrived telling us of a new flight number and departure time now 11 hours away at 0600 no communication from ground staff about luggage delay any options to stay somewhere nothing at 3am some passengers managed to raise the issue with airport manager who spoke to the flynas manager he then got off his backside issued boarding passes to the 20 odd people stranded and checked luggage is available to hopefully end up at our destination at the same time as us customer service at last such lack of service by a saudi airline does not reflect well on the country
12820,kenya airways,9,crew was very hospitable and polite,entebbe to johannesburg via nairobi the crew was very hospitable and polite good time management as well however the crew responsible for announcements should stop eating the words and try to be more audible
13438,lao airlines,7,friendly and efficient,short 50minute domestic flight from vientiane wattay to oudomxay airport and return with lao airlines the flights were about 45 minutes late on both legs there were only two flight attendants on this flights they were friendly and efficient the snacks and drinks were sufficient on this short flight
21376,united airlines,1,hunt in order to get my luggage,they dont hire enough customer service and staff it has taken me over 3 days so far in the process of trying to retrieve my luggage they canceled a flight so i could not get to my connecting flight however they sent my luggage to the country where i was to get the connection to my final destination customer service gave me wrong information twice regarding my luggage it takes hours to get in touch with customer service in one attempt it was literally seven hours when you finally do they give you the wrong information this happened multiple times they sent me on a full on scavenger hunt in order to get my luggage and i still havent gotten it united must be held accountable for their negligence i have spent hours of time energy on trying to locate my luggage when i went back to the airport as i was incorrectly instructed the air port was operating like a third world countries very few staff member and not well trained there has literally bean financial loss
14750,mihin lanka,3,not recommend to fly mihin lanka,i ended up flying from colombo to muscat with mihin lanka as the ticket was cheap to return from a break in sri lanka firstly boarding was delayed and no announcement was made which can be frustrating as a traveller it would have been appreciated to have an explanation as to why we were not able to board on time then when all the passengers got called to board it was a manic rush anyways fast forward to boarding the plane the stewards greeted all passengers which was good and asked to check our seat however i found it odd that every single air steward i passed demanded to see my seat number maybe it was because people sat in the wrong seats after i got to my seat there was a female cabin staff who immediately told me to put my bag up in the cabin i explained that i was taking some things out for the flight she got another steward to then put my bag up in the cabin as all the others around me were full whilst i was sitting down i noticed how the female staff were quite arrogant and abrupt with some passengers especially the elderly which i thought was unacceptable one was walking up and down telling people they need to keep their bag underneath their seat and not put it in the cabins but in a rude manner from then on it just seemed like the cabin staff were rushing up and down serving the drinks and meals as quick as they could the food was actually not too bad though even though it was 4 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment which meant the flight was quite boring also the ac made the plane like an ice box and it wasnt until the end of the flight when they asked some passengers if they wanted a blanket i had already gotten out my sweater at this point so overall i wasnt happy with the service i would not recommend to fly mihin lanka they need to train up their staff on how to be more friendlier and compassionate to others as well as how to talk in a kinder less arrogantrude tone
8234,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,souncl return more expensive than flybe but much better product my concern is only 6 pax up 9 back on jetstream 41might have been slack day but these load factors cannot be profitable hope they continue as all routes been competition
16975,royal brunei airlines,9,definitely recommend royal brunei,brisbane to london via brunei im working as a paramedic in uk and must fly at least twice a year to brisbane where my children live for the first time i used royal brunei and i was very impressed the short lay over and small price determined me to use rba first impression was the humble and professional attitude of the staff very clean planes good leg room amazing food crew walked the extra mile to accommodate passengers me included and their service was amazing the flight s attendants leaders on the bruneilondon leg took the time and listened to my feedback reintroduce the short lay over middle way between bruneilondon i definitely recommend royal brunei
5225,bahamasair,1,will never use again,nassau to miami awful airline will never use again we took 7 flights in total on this holiday around the bahamas and bahamasair was easily the worst destroyed husbands bag that had been in excellent condition before and been fine on all our other flights around the bahamas contacted bahamasair who refused to cover cost of replacement my family were split up at the gate when boarding we should have all been allowed priority boarding with the baby as we were all travelling together under the same booking had to wait for other family so didnt board until have the plane had already been allowed on baggage check in refused to allow a checked bag for my baby even though my ticket said i had 10kg was forced to pay an extra 35 flight time on my ticket was an hour earlier than the i was told at the airport would have made it very difficult to make my connecting flight fortunately the connecting flight was delayed understand delays happen but this was a complete flight time change that i had not been notified of
469,aerolineas argentinas,1,never fly with them again,our aerolineas argentinas flight cordobabuenos aires was canceled during our check in for the first leg in rosario the compensation was to travel in a cramped taxi with no luggage space had to carry bags on our laps for 5 hours to buenos aires we have had no reply to refund request by what others said this seems to be usual with aerolineas argentinas will never fly with them again
9345,fiji airways,9,i loved flying fiji airways,los angeles to sydney via nadi i loved flying fiji airways and i think it is absolutely value for money at the time i bought my return ticket sydney lax fiji airways was about 3040 cheaper than its competitors united qantas etc some reviews made me a bit hesitant to fly fiji airways but i am glad that i did the online checkin was easy and their ground personnel at the baggage drop counter was friendly and helpful also the boarding went smooth and all four flights i had departed on time on one of my flights just before takeoff a steward came to me and asked me whether i preferred to move to another seat that had an empty seat next to it because of my height 6 foot 6195 m i think this was very kind of him and in general i found the stewards on board very friendly and willing to help the food and the inflight entertainment was alright it may not be as fancy or shiny as the food and entertainment you get at huge airlines like emirates or qatar but for the money it was good value for the meals you had a vegetarian and nonvegetarian option and the inflight entertainment was sufficient again emirates may have a 150 movies to choose from and fiji only 30 but you cant watch them all anyway also the seats were fine and just like any other company besides maybe the more luxurious a380 seats i would really like to recommend fiji airways to fly with if you want a good value for money dont expect too much luxury but expect very friendly personnel food entertainment and seats that do the job and a company that brings you from a to b for 6070 of the price of their competitors
3099,air zimbabwe,6,communication wasnt great,when we purchased our ticket online we were not informed that we would be flying direct from victoria falls to johannesburg however it was explained to us at airport checkin that the flight was was victoria falls bulawayo joburg the flight was delayed about 30 minutes in vic falls and we deplaned when we arrived at bulawayo airport and eventually reboarded a larger plane communication wasnt great but we spoke with another passenger who took this flight more regularly and this was apparently the norm aside from the fact that it was free seat meaning pick any available seat regardless of what was indicated on boarding pass the flight went well i would not recommend this flight if you have a tight connection it would be wise to leave yourself sufficient room for delays most countries charge a departure tax when leaving by air often the tax is automatically added to the airline ticket price but not always as is the case with air zimbabwe so be prepared to pay 50usd cash before going through security
18714,south african airways,2,dont care about customers,saa is randomly putting me and my wife in terrible seats even if i have previously booked my seats its my fifth trip with saa this year 4 from and to sao paulo and johannesburg and today we are flying from jnb to mauritius and the same situation happened again they just dont care about customers if the flight is empty they just cancel the flight and put the customers from 2 or 3 empty flights in one full flight giving random seats to me and my wife and you just say that flight is full i was previously checked in seats 14d and 14e which was 3rd row in the aircraft map and my new boarding pass is row 71 because the computer randomly put me in row 47 in between 2 other people and the excuse is the same that the flight was cancelled but you can check same flight number in both boarding passes it is not the first time and the other times were far worse because when we buy from partner airlines you dont even give the option to choose the seat even if you call saa or the partner airline
7902,cubana airlines,4,cubana airlines customer review,flight from gatwick to holguin was smooth and i was impressed with the food and legroom on the plane however our next flight with them was a different story we were flying to havana at the crack of dawn and were informed there would be a stop off after only 15 minutes in the air we arrived at another airport and had to disembark before we took off for havana if i thought that flight was bad i was in for a shock regarding the last flight home 4 hours before we were due to leave to the airport we were told our flight was going to be delayed 11 hours returning to our hotel room we were told that it was delayed yet again but didnt have any idea for how long waited overnight to find out that another 18 hours delay was expected when we finally got the airport there was a further 4 hour delay so altogether a 33 hour delay which resulted in us missing our connecting flight back to scotland and an overnight stay in gatwick flight home also consisted of ham and cheese twice and no inflight entertainment and filthy toilets will never fly them again
5531,belavia,7,overall its a decent product,minsk to gatwick the airport in minsk looks like it has been renovated recently and it was modern and efficient boarding was slightly delayed but we got to gatwick on time the aeroplane was fairly comfortable and you get a bit more room in an embraer which has a 2x2 seating configuration the food and beverages were quite good and the aeroplane had some cool branding featuring a tankbased computer game that was developed in belarus cabin crew were a little gruff and could have been warmer and more welcoming but overall its a decent product and good value for money
4971,avianca,1,a horrible experience,unbelievable never in my 30 years of flights have i encountered such a horrible experience i booked one way thank god to ecuador and they had us waiting for about an hour before take off without any info there was not even a cup of water available the air vents above our seats dispenses hot air in an already hot cabin the directions to access the wifi were clear but no service was ever available overall a horrible experience

1003,air berlin,1,i was really pleasantly surprised,this was the first trip i tried air berlins then new business class service for europe i was really pleasantly surprised this is in my view a much better product than lh or the likes offer i like that you can get any food or snacks you want from their trolley at no extra charge this is much better than getting a preset tray with food you have no idea what it is air berlin also had very nice hot towels their staff really like what they do the only minus is that they are expensive
12417,jetstar asia,9,okay cabin crew,denpasar bali to singapore on time really friendly gate agent at dps easy boarding by groups and okay cabin crew website is really easy to navigate and add onremove services on request
11117,horizon air,7,horizon air customer review,ive flown with them 70 maybe 80 times in the last two yearsmostly commute trips from seattle to spokane and occasionally over to montana a few things about the q400 this is not an old or aged aircraft they are extremely fuel efficient compared to jet aircraft they can cover shorter legs in approximately the same time as regional or larger jets they tend to be a bit noisy on the inside particularly between rows 6 and 10 which are nearest the engines most of the examples in horizons fleet are less than five years old i like the fact the q400 can be boarded and deplaned from both front and rear making both processes faster than larger aircraft i agree that this is not an airplane that you would probably want to spend more than about 90 minutes on at a time i greatly prefer the q400 to the bombardier regional jets also flown by horizon horizons flight attendants are the best boarding in seattle spokane and portland is frequently a bit trying delays on horizon are just like any other carrier
18439,sky express airlines,1,very bad experience in general,naxos island to athens delayed as usual for about one hour without any notification or information provided by the ground staff no apology on board distant and unfriendly flight attendant old equipment with dilapidated interior no web checkin available very bad experience in general neither a professional service nor a reliable airline with not necessarily reasonable tariffs
18653,south african airways,7,6 across in business not acceptable,cape town to johannesburg ive flown saa over 50 times over the last 2 years and without exception every flight has been on time crew have been consistently good now the moans just flown on the a350 in business lovely aircraft but 6 across in business is not acceptable for a long haul flight these days made worse by the fact that the seats on the a330300 are 121 and are superb theres no consistency i travel to europe regularly in business and avoid saa simply due to the seats on the older aircraft theyve been the same for over 15 years
4726,aurigny air,3,aurigny air customer review,we flew ryanair to stansted to connect with this flight ryanair late and baggage took 30 minutes to get to carousel which meant we were late for bag drop minimum one hour for domestic flight rang aurigny to see if we could get our bags processed 50 minutes before departure time no go and no assistance i was in the middle of booking flights for the next day when a staff member menzies aviation came out and asked if he could assist us when we explained the situation he told us the flight had been delayed and he would see if he could get our bags on 2 minutes later all sorted no thanks to aurigny our flight left 40 minutes late anyway and as we have now found out their flights had been delayed by fog so why didnt the customer service person at aurigny know that and also offer to see if we could join that flight maybe it was because she had no customer skills and spoke to me as if i was trying to put something over her
17984,sichuan airlines,6,polite and welltrained attendants,ordinary shorthaul experience from dalian to xuzhou with sichuan airlines quite affordable cheaper than crh train polite and welltrained flight attendants free drinking water and snacks provided during the 70minute flight economy class seats are not so spacious as expected no wifi

5792,blue1,6,blue1 customer review,blqhel which they fly 2 weekly during the summer a bit of a random route but the flight was full due to very cheap fares i got in on an ow for 107 incl all taxes flight departed about 35 minutes late and a little time was made up en route plane was spotlessclean with blue1s new seats service was generally ok but everything is now forpurchase including soft drinks not sure how they can call themselves a fullservice airline like that bologna is a disaster of an airport with the construction and there was only one agent for checkin for the entire flight and nothing for g well for the price this can slide
15377,olympic air,9,olympic air customer review,flew on the 16th of june athens to mykonos very short 35 min flight on a dash 8 q400 staff were courteous and happy to help on ground and inflight regardless of the short flight drinks and some peanuts were served which was a nice touch considering how short the cruise time was roughly 5 minutes before descent started

23083,yakutia airlines,5,did not know what to expect,moscow to sochi flying yakutia airlines for the first time i did not know what to expect i flew economy which allows you one incabin piece of luggage up to 10 kg within size restrictions boarding the aircraft the first thing i noticed was the 737800s aisle was very narrow the aircraft was showing wear i noticed the seats had ashtrays and the twoplug receptacles for headphones however no inflight entertainment was offered how old was this aircraft that said there was more legroom than i expected so it was not too uncomfortable the seat only had an airline safety card no magazine and no airsickness bags they distributed airsickness bags to people on landing approach the flight left a few minutes late when airborne a sandwich was served bland chicken and cheese when i asked for some water after the beverage service had passed the unfriendly flight attendant acted as if i had asked for the world the flight was relatively uneventful until the end our approach to sochi was during clear skies yet the landing was rough right wheel first the left then a hard nose down passengers let out a gasp as we shuddered down the runway before the pilot smoothed out our landing i wonder if because of the age of the aircraft that it was lacking the state of the art avionics that most aircraft have which make such landings rare nowadays i fly relatively frequently and it has been a long time since i had such a landing in the end we made it safely for a nationalregional midtosmall airline i would rank it as average it was what you expect when flying economy on such a carrier
4552,arkefly,8,arkefly customer review,used arkefly for two holidays this year las palmas gran canaria in may and mombasa kenya in augustseptember to gran canaria was a very pleasant flight we unexpectedly all had an own personal entertainment screen in the headrest and on our return journey too therefore we expected to have them on our 11 hour long intercontinental flight to mombasa but surprisingly we did not real letdown our seats row 15 before the emergency exits were said to have limited reclining capability but they did in fact not move one inch at all on the journey there they did recline a bit on our redeye back we flew comfort class which is really worth the additional charge 15eur per person per flight the 8 centimetres extra are the difference between sleeping fairly comfortably or cramped and the night comfort kit really helped me get some rest out of the 4 flights 1 was delayed but it was only a little over an hour and they caught up a with quite a few of the lost minutes clean planes easy self service luggage checkin friendly staff reasonable prices for airplane food and always good landings so id use them again

22075,viva air,1,30 dollars for my tiny carry on bag,i decided to give viva air a second chance but it has been one of the biggest mistakes ive ever made my last experience was horrible and after complaining i received vouchers for the tickets that i had purchased it turns out that when paying taxes for those tickets it was pretty much like buying a new ticket the customer service is horrible when i got to the airport this time i expressed my concern about not being able to check in online and the answer that i got is that i made a mistake and i would have to pay 25 dollars for them to check us in then i said that i had a small carry on suitcase to bring with me and their trick is that if your personal item doesnt fit in the box that they have designed to measure your luggage you have to pay extra well my bag was too big for the box and i ended up paying 30 dollars for my tiny carry on bag to be checked am i using this airline again no way t
6003,breeze airways,1,breeze isnt helping at all,our flight from phoenix back home to ct was delayed several times throughout the course of this afternoon breeze just canceled our flight due to weather we are know there is no weather anywhere where our flight is going or where its been there is no way to get home on the airline for at least 3 days and they wont fly us home on another airline we are now stranded on the other side of the country and breeze isnt helping at all
4754,aurigny air,9,aurigny air customer review,stngcistn overall package was professional and good value for money the atr 72 used felt like a whiteknuckle ride for much of the journey dont know if these aircraft are affected more by the turbulence attentive and cheerful fas on both sectors and good updates from the flight deck only reason for not awarding more marks was a 2hr delay on return leg not entirely attributable to aurigny and well dealt with this airline really puts some of the larger carriers to shame regarding their standards of customer care

12286,jetblue airways,4,really frustrating,while i generally have had a positive experience of jetblue in past i was shocked by jetblues late cancellation of its flight from aguadilla to nyc more than the cancellation the agents at the airport told me that my hotel would be compensated for up to 250 given there were no more flights for the day when i got home the customer service agents said that this was not what they said and that they likely meant your hotel might be reimbursed up to that amount it was really surprising and also given the hassle and additional expenses we had to incur to get a hotel and to another airport the next day it was really frustrating
23153,zipair,5,insist i paid for another 23kg of luggage,twenty years in the film distribution business and never once has an airline refused to allow me to hand carry movie posters in a tube until my first flight with zipair from nrtsin on nov 4th 2022 they said my poster tube exceeded the dimensions of their overhead compartment they insist that i paid for another 23kg of checkin luggage when my checkin luggage was 195kg of 23kg and my hand carry was only 45kg of 7kg it was very clear that they did not want to listen to my explanation that my luggage was under weight and the poster tube weighed under 2kg they kept saying that it is company policy the flight was less than 20 occupied a very empty flight the overhead compartment would have easily contained my poster tube with plenty of space to spare poster paper measures 27inch width and 39inch height rolled into a poster tube cardboard 2 inches longer than the posters width the cabin crew were unsmiling patrolling the aisles like the police i found them annoying as they made their presence felt too much and gave out that i am watching you feeling and its not like they were giving out water you have to pay for it my prepaid inflight meal was not bad the expensive wagyu beef bowl is available and they seemed to have stopped selling their normal beef bowlminus points here purchased a can of suntory premium beer and pringles paid with a credit card but had to type in my details on their tablet prices were reasonable but i had to selftype all the cc details etc for it to happen cash is not accepted for inflight sales otherwise the flight was smooth cabin was clean hardly any pax less rigidity and friendly cabin crew may improve business keep your current attitude and scoot will benefit most with their flexibility and surprisingly professional and charming cabin crew on my sinnrt flight on the same trip both flight tix were bought using the airline official website
4704,atlantic airways,8,atlantic airways customer review,the short journey was very pleasant the staff were very friendly and the food onboard was excellent i would recommend them to anyone flying to the faroe islands

4475,andes lneas areas,1,have not reimbursed my money,buenos aires to bariloche the airline canceled my flight without letting me know i had paid for 4 passengers at the check in they informed me the flight was canceled and they offered no help i had to book last minute with another airline for over twice the cost and andes lneas areas still have not reimbursed my money
16322,primera air,9,was great value for money,newark to paris as a result of the delays in receiving their a321lr aircraft premera air contracted euroatlantic to fly the newark pariscdg routethe check in took about 45 mins as it was a full flight it took about 40 mins to get through security at newark due to the lack of tsa staff and screening equipmentthe seats were comfortable ahd a personal tv screen in each seat which had a limited selection of films and tv shows there was also a usb port to charge personal devices there were no headphones offered on board luckily we had our own set the scheduled flight time was 6 hrs 25 mins we took off about 30 mins late but we managed to arrive on time into cdg the euroatlantic staff were friendly and attentive and looked after the passengers on the flight meals and drinks were provided to those passengers who booked their meals through the primera air website overall this flight was great value for money
14209,luxair,6,dash 8 is not the best,luxair serves sandwiches and even champagne to economy passengers and for reasonable prices however since they replaced many of their jets with noisy propelleraircraft flyingtimes have become a lot longer and the comfort of their dash 8 is not the best on my recent flight from arn to lux that was three hours long normally it takes only 2 hours and 10 minutes they had only one drinkrun which is poor for such a long flight seating was cramped dashstandard and there was no onboard entertainment for me the slightly better service does not outweigh much longer flight times and this is why i will tend to consider other airlines into fra again in the future
3963,alitalia,5,alitalia has improved,rome to london historically my flights with alitalia have never been pleasant most frequent occurrence the lost baggage surprisingly regardless of its financial position alitalia has improved flights were on time baggage wasnt lost and service was decent the preflight auction for business class is also a great idea well the lack of politeness of an italian cabin crew and the ridiculously narrow seat pitch are not a surprise at all
16781,rex airlines,9,compliment the cabin crew,i would like to compliment the cabin crew on this flight their attitude and attention to detail reminded me of the good old ansett airline days where the staff took great pride in looking after their passengers you could see that they just enjoyed what they we doing especially sergios contagious smile beaming the full length of the aircraft that topped off an overall excellent experience i was fortunate to get the same on my return flight zl152 on 14 dec 2022 please thank this team for a job well done rex airlines has definitely become my number one choice when flying domestically
6338,buta airways,8,everything went smoothly here,tbilisi to baku everything went smoothly here boarding was quick and on time we were pushed back on time which also meant the flight left on time it was only a short hop of 55mins i will see how they are again when i fly 3 hours plus on my next flight overall no issues airline very smooth and would recommend
9923,flysafair,5,option to purchase priority is an absolute scam,overall a comfortable flight but extremely frustrated that i paid for priority check in and boarding and received neither on both our flight there and back feel ripped off and like the option to purchase priority is an absolute scam still had to wait in all the quest both at the checkin counters and on boarding the flights if you cant deliver the service dont offer it and certainly dont charge your customers for it i had 2 other passengers with me who i also paid priority for what a waste
21818,virgin america,8,a very good airline,san francisco to los angeles this was an excellent flight on a very good airline i like virgin america with their modern simplistic approach with a focus on the things that matter and not others which cost money the plane was modern clean and streamlined with intimate lighting for an early evening flight from sfo to lax the service was friendly appreciating that at this time most of the passengers just want to relax i was very impressed with virgin america and will fly with them again
8371,edelweiss air,5,was actually not bad,zurich to newark staff was very friendly and the food was not bad the drinks were frequent and alcohol included which was great there were customers who smelled as though they had not showered in days they were up and moving all flight several passengers yelled at them as the airline attendants did not address their lack of concern for other passengers had it not been for these people the flight would not have been bad for a 9 hour flight the airline was actually not bad all things considered
21685,vietnam airlines,4,disappointing and frustrating from start to finish,disappointing and frustrating from start to finish took hours to check all passengers in at sydney airport no one was notified about a priority line for those who had already done online checkin nor was there signage we were told by the employee checking us in that we should have waited in that line she was not a vn airlines employee for the whole flight most peoples inflight entertainment was not working at all or otherwise malfunctioning to the point that it could not be used staff were not able to offer an explanation other than to reset the screens over and over again no apology or acknowledgment given this was also the same experience on my return flight 7 days later leg room is reasonable for economy but the seating was hard and uncomfortable webbing behind the seats that holds things is extremely tight and cannot fit anymore stuff in there so the extras they give like a bag with slippers blanket pillow bottle of water etc you just have to figure out where to place some peoples chairs leaned back way more than others and it was very hard to get them to go back and forward
875,air astana,2,no personal inflight entertainment,delhi to moscow via astana the checkin staff at delhi airport were more suspicious towards indian passengers the staff was asking more questions than the immigration officers the ground staff was managed by air india and the staff of the air india is the worst they were very rude and behaved unprofessionally the inflight entertainment looked like it was from the 90s there was no personal inflight entertainment system on board the plane looked the older fleet cabin crew was quite friendly but the food was the typical i expected kazakhstan cuisine on board beef was not served on board and now the transit part astana airport was of good size and very well maintained but the problem is that the airport doesnt provide drinking water to the departure and transfer passengers and people have no choice but to buy drinking water 1 euro for 500 ml wifi was not working the login wasnt opening neither in my laptop nor in my mobile phone astana to moscow no complaints for this flight because everything was perfect from food to the inflight entertainment system returning moscow sheremetyevo to almaty inflight service by the cabin crew was very good problem was that there was no personal inflight entertainment system the checkin staff at the moscow sheremetyevo was quite friendly and helpful almaty to delhi flight was late due to transfer passengers but it was not a problem because the duration was not much the problem the cabin crew looked exhausted for no reason the food served on the flight was only a light breakfast omelette and a small piece of potato cutlet which is not sufficient for a 2 hour flight a complete meal should have been served there was personal no inflight entertainment system only a screen on top at a distant which was playing a movie in russiankazakh almaty airport was quite small but well maintained the airport looked crowded because of the huge amount of passengers and also no potable water for passengers only payable bottled water
2201,air malta,7,lost a day of our holiday,flew air malta from gatwick to malta for the 1st time on 28 october flew with them as they included 20kg baggage and they had a mid morning flight as i hate to arrive any where after dark flight was due to leave at 1155 display boards said gate information at 1105 checked at 1105 and it now said information at 1715 went to airline desk who were not that helpful only saying food vouchers would be provided finally took off at 1845 or thereabouts captain apologised said the incomming flight had tech problems and that they had to change aircraft the aircraft was clean cabin crew friendly one guy went out his way to help the couple in front of us with a child in distress inflight meal was a snack but fine when the flight is only 3 hours arrived at our hotel about 1230 am woke up late so effectively lost a day of our holiday i guess these things can happen i had a similar experience with thai airways years ago that caused us to miss connecting flights and taxis flight home no problems same clean aircraft good cabin crew i would use them again and would not tell any one considering to fly with them not too however i was disappointed in the lack of information at gatwick and the indifference of the staff at the airline desk i guess a lot of passengers will b claiming delay compensation under the eu 2162014 rule myself included wonder how airlines make a profit on a flight when it goes like this one
1950,air india express,8,air india express customer review,traveled shjcokshj last month i have selected this flight because the holiday season started and ix was the cheapest available from uae to kochi after my disastrous trip by air india last month on the same sector i was not expecting much from ix but i should admit that i was surprised nice and clean aircraft with enough legroom polite cabin crew who were attending the passengers with a smile and on time take off and landing was part of the surprise package and all these were for half the price of the next available airline
9591,flair airlines,4,not a relaxing flight,flight attendants in the back were very obnoxious talking very loud and laughing the whole entire flight even heard them using inappropriate language very immature and unprofessional not a relaxing flight when youre tired
3689,airlink,8,a decent regional airline,airlink are a decent regional airline and the staff are pleasant and competent if youre travelling in business class on the e190 id go for row 2 you get extra leg room or storage space under the seat in front you can recline the seat without encroaching on the person behind you the seat has 2 windows albeit slightly misaligned compared to row 1 which only has 1 window reasonable snack and a drink check in was quick in windhoek downsides no lounge at windhoek buses in departure and arrival with no special transport for c class appalling baggage retrieval time at or tambo but i dont know if thats the airline or the airport
6819,china airlines,8,everything worked out fine,overall a good experience in economy online checkin was easy the mobile app looks a bit dated but worked as well boarding passes provided for wallet friendly and attentive staff the special meal i ordered was provided on all flight food arlight better than many european carriers crew walked around plenty of times with water and juice decent cabin on b777 with personal ife on the a330 older but still functional good selection of international and recent movies seat pitch ok even for tall people all flights on time connection in taipei without problems and helpful staff available not the best flight to blow you away but everything worked out fine

12025,jet airways,1,the worst you can experience,1 the jet airways bom to lhr flight was supposed to takeoff at 235am all passengers were on time no weather issues but they delayed it until 3am and thats when bom airport authority declared runway maintenance for 1hr finally the flight took off at 415 am and i missed all other connections first issue with jet airways is around punctuality 2 on board service is the worst you can experience on any airline possible on a 10hr long flight they served one meal that too was of poor quality 3 hygiene is something that this flight has never seen i guess i booked my flight with delta air lines and they out sourced it to jet airways and i had to go through the saddest experience of my international flights so far its really sad to see an indian airline providing such substandard international flight experience to people of india and from other countries
18558,smartwings,2,rudest service experienced,dubrovnik to amsterdam via prague first flight was delayed by approx 1 hour so we had to run at prg airport to catch our connecting flight connection time was too short for the luggage which arrived two days later in amsterdam no apologies or helpful information at all by smartwings staff rudest service i have ever experienced

13861,lion air,7,decent selection of drinks and food,jakarta to jayapura with lion air flight left and arrived on time managed to score one of the rows of empty seats at the back good for sleeping on this overnight flight a decent selection of drinks and food were sold on borad unusual for lion
9201,eva air,9,very pleasant 12 hour journey,bangkok to london this is my 6th flight to thailand with eva i no longer bother with premium economy as the economy class is a very good product although the aircraft was over 10 years old it was smart and spotless everything worked the food and staff were excellent eva was a delight spacious clean all full service amenities offered down to a toothbrush toothpaste the staff were great which altogether made for a very pleasant 12 hour journey
7956,delta air lines,1,abandoned us with no way home,flying with delta was the worst experience coming back from a business trip our first leg of the trip was from new orleans to atlanta the second leg was to go on the indianapolis the plane was a half hour late i wont go into all the details but the plane was further delayed getting up to atlanta and hour late since there was a storm we were unable to land the pilot mentioned we were low on fuel so he decided to take us to destin fl we sat in destin a long time finally refueled and headed back to atlanta we had to park because there was no gate for us we missed our connecting flight but found out delta had automatically booked us on an early morning flight good right we decided to wait it out in the airport the next morning we saw the rebooked flight was canceled no notice from delta no subsequent rebooking the lines to rebook were well over a mile long checking online all flights were full with the exception of connecting flights that would take us further away we did not want to chance that we ended up getting a flight with another airline that would leave at 3pm we feel as if delta airline abandoned us at the atlanta airport with no way home

4789,austrian airlines,5,recommend but with lesser expectations,austrian airlines which i have flown many times of decades has after been taken over by lufthansa sunk to a new low the seats are a much tighter squeeze the qualify of the food on a transatlantic flight once among the best is now mediocre smaller in quality though with an option of two different main meals chicken or pasta the cutlery is not even plastic but rather some sort of cardboard plastic the knife breaking as soon as i cut into the rather tough chicken even lufthansa and swiss have metal cutlery limited drink runs during the flight and only water crew itself is polite friendly and dutiful flights both direction full and cramped only a muffin served for breakfast nycvienna no cold cutscheese platter as years past no fruit no yogurt i believe lufthansa has dragged austrian airlines down several notches since the takeover flights on time baggage arrived safely both directions i would recommend them but with lesser expectations
21288,turkmenistan airlines,5,turkmenistan airlines customer review,recently travelled to india and back during the volcanic ash issues lots of people complain about this airline but at the end of the day you get what you pay for outgoing flight was on time no entertainment on board something they do need to look into food and service is what you would expect from the price of the ticket the return journey was a little more complicated because of the volcanic ash everyone was asked to check in and several hours later the flight was cancelled they should have phoned everyone not to come to the airport i was travelling with my young son and 2 daughters which made it difficult they did provide food water coffee etc and the taxi fare back home to the village when the flight was cancelled askhabad airport is now 10 times cleaner than amritsar
10248,garuda indonesia,4,choose a different airline,london to denpasar via medan the cabin crew were some of the best and you could see why theyve won so many awards we found the a330 quiet compared to a 777 te food was good the ife was absolutely shocking in terms of tv have had better 20 years ago would also question the flat bed although it is flat its also angled and thin definitely not the comfiest would try and choose a different airline next time when we booked it was direct with 1x2x1 seating but they made us stop and put us in 2x2x2 so wasnt a great start
12620,jetstar pacific,4,jetstar pacific customer review,arrived at ho chi minh airport to be told that my flight to hoi an was delayed from 110pm to 620pm the reason given was technical offered no food or drink vouchers for the delay although i later found out that somebody else had eventually boarded at 550pm and were in the buses ready to go the plane then asked to get off as there was a problem we all had to file back into the airport where we waited for another 30 minutes before boarding again on the plus side must say one staff member on the aircraft was kind and gave me a bottle of his own water i should add that if there is a technical problem with a plane then i am happy to wait until it is fixed but i wonder if the original problem with this plane was technical somebody else had been told it was operational and if it was why didnt they spot the problem with the wheel earlier when carrying out technical checks relieved that my return trip to ho chi min does not connect with an international flight i fly out of vietnam two days later thankfully
22462,volotea,7,a 30 euro voucher to say my flight was great,volotea is offering me a 30 euro voucher to say my flight was great it was a great flight i do find their website very confusing because wasnt sure that kind of membership i had to pay for or what it would get me i would fly with them again
5673,blue air,3,ridiculous service and website,barcelona to bucharest ridiculous service and website i tried 5 times with 5 different cards to pay for a checked in luggage and it was saying there is a mistake the mistake was coming from their website after struggling for two days i gave up on the idea and i took a small luggage upon boarding of the plane i was stopped for having my luggage and a computer bag after almost breaking my computer i had to carry all of my things in my hands and only put the bag itself in the luggage the result is the plane was full with little things everywhere jackets cables computers chargers just because the staff was so against the concept of a bag purse bag not a big one it was so annoying and frustrating to make the whole experience better for the passengers the music playing in the plane while we waited to board was some intense folklore rhythm that made the situation even more tense
18300,singapore airlines,9,provides excellent service,singapore airlines ranged from excellent to good sydsincph oct 6 2022 was excellent of course in economy we were packed like sardines but the tin was large enough and neighbours small enough that we werent particularly uncomfortable this is the third time weve flown postcovid the first time on thai it seemed that covid was the excuse to give no service at all but singapore airlines both at xmas 2021 and last month provides excellent service food was very good and alcohol plentiful the entertainment system provided enough to occupy us for this long haul flight attendants were very attentive we stopped over in singapore on our way home unfortunately sinsyd leaves shortly after midnight the flight was delayed and it was after 1am before we left this is a long time between meals and we were uncertain whether wed be given a snack and night cap before going to sleep but no announcement was made and we stayed in limbo between sleeping and waking for most of this leg of the four legs of our journey this is our only complaint
5556,belavia,6,belavia customer review,belavia is one of the carrier 2 operators on this route for 5kg of excess baggage i was not charged was a very old 737500 with the smell of fuel and unwashed socks in the cabin no leg room and uncomfortable seats crew talking and seemed very strict with no smiles
21945,virgin australia,6,the staff were pleasant,unfortunately the flight was delayed by 40 minutes otherwise i enjoyed the flight the staff were pleasant and well organised and apart from the late departure it was a good flight
3230,airasia india,6,overall not a bad experience,airline with most compact seat arrangements iwould avoid this but in last moment its fare was cheapest from delhi to jaipur icing on the cake was i got last row window seat as it was the only row which was available fortunately no one was there in the middle seat so little bit of comfort departed on time and reached jaipur before time cabin crew looks courteous but as it was early morning 5 am flight so after boarding slept all time so never needed to interact with them seats are compact as i said earlier overall not a bad experience for less than hour ling flight
15588,onur air,8,onur air customer review,manchester ercan via dalaman left on time and arrived early food average and baggage allowance good no checking for excess charges extra leg room on return was money well spent what i liked about onur air was that they were not always trying to sell products overall i was impressed
1487,air dolomiti,2,have her case under her feet,i flew with air dolomiti twice in may even though i was initially supposed to fly with lufthansa but they changed us to air dolomiti both flights were late the first one was 3 hours late and made us miss our connecting flight to the usa the second flight from frankfurt to trieste was one hour late on the second flight they made my mother have her case under her feet because there was no space in the overhead cabins while they let people keep their backpacks and jackets there
6857,china airlines,3,never fly with china airlines again,los angeles to jakarta via taipei will never fly with china airlines again flight attendants are rude no common courtesy get into your personal space without warning no excuse me no nothing felt like a harrasment because i purchased a premium economy seats for my infant and have to argue back and forth about it because they didnt believe my 15 year old is not 2 years old i bought 3 premium economy seats for my 2 kids and i but they only gave me 2 meals and not counting my other kid their excuse is they dont have infant food even tho i told them my 15 year old can eat anything asking me to show my kid passport all the time because they thought my 15 year old is too big for her age told me to deflate my flytot even tho other passengers in economy class are allowed to using theirs even after i deflated it they keep coming back and woken me up because they thought i was still using it i have to literally show them i didnt use the flytot anymore again i will never fly with china airlines ever again the only reason i gave 2 stars for cabin service and not 1 star is because one of the flight attendant actually felt bad for keep asking me about my child but out of 4 flights weve taken only 1 was bearable
1402,air china,5,does not have personal ife,hong kong to beijing the ground handling and boarding process wasnt the smoothest the flight was delayed and air china tends to operate out of remote terminal boarding gates which require a shuttle ride or extensive walking times everything was fine once we were airborne the staff were attentive and the seats offered a reasonable amount of legroom even though they seemed narrower than usual the air china a321 does not have personal ife they still use the archaic communal ife systems food was average at best keep your expectations in line with prices paid and you should be fine
19531,syrianair,9,syrianair customer review,brusselsaleppo damascusbrussels cheapest tickets to syria direct flights from brussels to aleppo and damascus friendly crew adequate food although older airbus they were clean and looked well maintained and a lot of legspace
22541,vueling airlines,3,cabin crew was totally nonchalant,its like lightning striking twice when the exact previous comment was also a complaint about whats the point of having priority boarding because paying for the space plus seats priority boarding and overhead cabin bag space turned out to be a complete farce as such there was no difference being in boarding group 1 and by the time we got to our seats the baggage bins were completely full the cabin crew was totally nonchalant and did nothing about it despite clearly being aware of the situation what a complete waste of 70 if there was any consolation to go by the crew got the aircraft airborne really quickly and we landed ahead of schedule bags didnt go missing either but thats where the positives end
1867,air india,8,an excellent flight,i have read mixed reviews of this flight but it was an excellent flight with top notch service it was a proper three course meal the food was 5 star level i cannot say about veg food because i eat non veg and they gave us food three times with regards to drinks it was pretty decent with good brands the tv was working properly but i usually see the maps and do some work or read books towards the end of flight the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience on my return flight it was the same experience but some tvs were not working but since the flight was empty they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed the team of monica and hiren were good the flight from nyc to mumbai had better food then from mumbai to nyc both the flights were on time i understand that because of 232 seating there was privacy issue
6611,cathay pacific airways,5,no legroom at all,plane appeared to be brand new however very cramped seats no legroom at all thank god only 2 hour flights as very uncomfortable food was a packed lunch box service was good and brisk entertainment was good
20306,thomas cook airlines,6,flight was okay,gatwick to heraklion mt 1178 6th september 2019 left a little late but it made up some timethe meal which i had prepaid for arrived almost three hours into the flight no water was offered or wine just a weak flavoured tea which didnt really quench my thirst this was very disappointing i expected more the aircraft seemed very cramped inside the take off message during the safety demonstration was very mumbled the flight was ok it would have been nice if the flight destination screens had been switched on once through passport control and having collected my case there was a row of coaches outside the terminal and even at 10pm the place was very busy on return arrived at heraklion airport packed with people no where to sit as we waited for a delayed flight back to gatwick this time the flight destination screens were switched on and off in between an old episode of an american sitcom i had to ask when the food was coming as it had been several hours since my last meal again no water or wine was offered only another cup of flavourless tea it seemed that duty free sales came first the flight was okay
18085,silkair,7,service is quite good,singapore to bandung i call slikair premiumlowfare because my base is in south east asia so my choice is silkair rather than airasia for low cost the service is quite good seat comfort is standard the entertaiment is accesible on your own device and they served food too the cabin crew also nice
6075,british airways,9,service was good,busy day at lhr and flight full lounge crowded but b gates lounge quieter flight left on time very professional crew greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return custom a nice touch service was good food average entertainment good early arrival quick processing at jfk all good
9283,fastjet,9,what a welcome surprise,what a welcome surprise fastjet is giving real competition to kenya airways whose fares are significantly higher for about 80 less we flew them from lilongwe malawi to dar es salaam they departed and arrived on time the plane was new and comfortable yes they charge for additional services but the customer has control of how much beyond the very low fare they want to spend for advance booking more advantageous seating baggage and food even with all the extras our fare remained very low
2897,air tahiti nui,4,very unprofessional service,auckland to papeete from unannounced menu changes to wine that although listed on the menu was unavailable with cabin crew staff who very conveniently forgot passenger requests a very unprofessional service on an emirates scale of 1 to 10 with emirates at 10 this outfit rates a 4 on a par with air fiji never again

656,afriqiyah airways,4,afriqiyah airways customer review,londontripolidakar returning in june much better than charter flights from paris or charters to gambia very few people on all legs of the flight meant that everyone could stretch out over 3 seats fast and efficient checkin i was told i could have taken 40kg but the ticket issued through last minutecom only said 23kg entertainment good western and arabic films interesting documentary and tapes of koran staff responsive but dont fuss laid back will give extra food plenty of drinks food all halal and morereal than that served on western flights but the same on return delay at gatwick but they held all connecting flights in tripoli planes modern and clean staff helpful and responsive in dakar in changing return flight for under 50 good cheap way to get to west africa this is an airline that caters for ordinary people and adequately meets those needs
20459,thomson airways,9,real attentive service,preveza to london gatwick with thomson we have always talked about memorable flights over the years and a thomson airways from cyprus over 12 years ago always came to mind however our return flight from preveza greece has just taken the prize flight delayed for approx 15 hours and sat in the aircraft awaiting clearance the pilot kept us honestly informed with a touch of humour so the whole episode was quite relaxed the cabin crew where brilliant and a credit to the airline smartly attired which is becoming a rarity great humour and real attentive service
16485,qantaslink,9,we had no complaints,flew qantaslink sydney to port macquarie on the 31st following an international arrival on qantas from the uk this flight arrived early and due to a very quick transit through security customs and baggage reclaim we were at domestic 5 hours before our booked flight initially told that by the qantas staff in the terminal that due to our ticket type we would have to wait for this flight despite space being available on the earlier one then spoke to a staff member on the sales desk who was efficient in transferring us without questions and more impressively at nil cost the flight itself was only 50 mins and despite the coffee machine not working we had no complaints most impressive ground staff
1870,air india,5,entertainment non existent,check in was smooth website works staff at counters were ok including those in seoul food average domestic connections were ok and food served was hot inflight announcements poor audio quality grammar and mistakes in announcement including time does not look professional cabin heads were both male and generally invisible safety only on screen only one out of pop down screens worked in one case my inflatable was on the ground onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wifes worked touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work headphones are not provided both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them they said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years food was bad and rice was undercooked no hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers staff good to average tokyo flight unresponsive and rude opposite on my seoul flight interiors worn out in both flights lumbar support lacking and worn out seats thin reminded me of cheap domestic flights
20434,thomson airways,8,much better than we expected,we recently flew with thomsons from stansted to cancun it was a long 10 hour flight but surprisingly we found it much better than we expected from a charter flight extra legroom going out and premium on the return the food was just about edible and as good as british airways or virgin the seating was more spacious than we expected and in premium as good as the just mentioned airlines being mildly claustrophobic i found the boeing 787 very spacious and airy the service was attentive and friendly and better than many charter flights we have done quite a few of the reviews for this flight are negative but i have to say we thought it was much better than we expected and therefore were not disappointed for the price and stansted is much more convenient for us we found that it was much better than british airways and overall well done to thomson you excelled when it could so easily have been a never again experience
11624,iran air,4,iran air customer review,tehranisfahanshiraztehran flight i went on a 90s fokker 100 from tehran to isfahan and to shiraz leased or bought from iberia since some of the signs were in spanish which was comfortable the ticket only cost 30 for each leg the service was a lot better than i expected finding bottled water in the seat pockets luxurious compared to the 2 dollars you have to pay to get a cup of water with american airlines giving me a mint before the flight and serving a snack the seats were comfortable but i did not try the bathrooms i heard too many stories that they did not work they had excellent service for handicapped my grandmother was with me crew is kind and attentive actually serving to the passengers request but dont interact much or show emotions shiraztehran we took a soviet era tupolev 154m which belonged to iran air tours which while having the same service as mentioned above was extremely uncomfortable air conditoning broken and with all signs written in russian avoid russian planes at all cost dont worry about your luggage since they take good care of them
18291,singapore airlines,4,my inflight food was very bad,they cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call something that could have been done online for free but they found it necessary to call they even didnt offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on singapore airport their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution after trying to get in touch with them it took 15 month to get a reply saying they dont care also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure my inflight food was very bad and inflight service almost nonexistent you had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks inflight entertainment was good with many recent movies i will never fly again with singapore airlines after this
19913,thai airasia,3,space between rows is small,first time seeing that if you purchase two tickets at the same time you get two different spots not next to each other have no idea why i should be separated with my wife on flights the space between rows is small seats are awful it was my most horrible flight
7514,copa airlines,1,worst airline ive ever witnessed,the airline decides to change our original departurereturn times and we call trying to adjust our flights accordingly a normal procedure for most flights copa air is the biggest scam ive witnessed they basically switched one of our flights to profit off of us by giving us an undesirable flight at 2 am and when we called to correct it they tried to charge us an exorbitant fee of 3000 to return our original departure time of 3pm this has to be the worst airline ive ever witnessed instead i am forced to pay 300 and rebook with american airlines instead disgrace of an airline
21397,united airlines,4,united lacks kindness,i have a broken foot and using crutches i did not reserve a wheelchair but when i arrived in newark and saw 5 wheelchairs unused by the gate i asked if i could use one the united people declined my request then when i asked a united person wheeling an empty chair she also declined for this i think united lacks kindness for handicap people
15290,norwegian,4,i told him to calm down,copenhagen to gatwick in september 2019 arrived in plenty of time for our flight no luggage to check in so just sat around eventually the gate number came up and we were the furthest you could possibly get from that gate my boy then decides now was a good time to want a wee the toilets at copenhagen were down a set of spiral stairs so we had to leave our trolley and go down when we get back up trolley gone he now wants a sip of water so i stopped and bought one from a nearby shop very slow as none of the machines had water at the departure gate on the way out next thing i hear is our flight number being called as last call the girl at the gate was very nice and said to relax as we werent the last passengers to arrive the guy at the plane started shouting at me about where we were sitting cross words were exchanged by both parties as i told him to calm down whilst i dig out the boarding passes he said i shouldnt tell him to calm down and that he could bar me from the flight he eventually gave in and let us on board later after we had settled in they were serving drinks and i asked for a glass of red wine to go with my meal a cabin staff member said i was not allowed a drink i asked why and was told because he says so pointing to the the small minded petty idiot i had met getting on that man needs to address his anger management and have some customer service training i cant give the airline a bad review because of one person that works for them but i can say hes not a plus point for the airline
2481,air namibia,3,air namibia customer review,frankfurt to windhoek return economy check in no problem flights on time seats ok food reasonable outward leg was the first time i have ever been cold at the back of an airbus in flight service disappointing crew did the minimum they could get away with on occasions were actually rude uncaring and ignored requests for assistance main screen entertainment only with non functioning headphones i do not recommend air namibia but they have little competition to push standards up german um pah music during boarding and disembarking amused the germans as well as the brits
20630,tigerair australia,1,no confirmation on refund,tigerair i have now been waiting since the 31320 for a refund on a flight you cancelled and have answered the same questions 3 times now thats 6 weeks no confirmation on refund no response to paying and when no call centre to get answers zero stars if you even care about that as theres no way to complain
18676,south african airways,5,serving lunch at 0930,johannesburg to maputo i like saa and they are always punctual what i take exception to is their business class cabins on the a319 aircraft with 5 across seating noticeably different to their a320s with only 4 across saa should not be selling the middle seat to ensure conformity as the airline is struggling financially i would have though it cant afford to alienate premium customers but henceforth if a flight is operated with an a319 ill downgrade to economy and save a small fortune serving lunch at 0930 in the morning is silly most passengers wanted tea and coffee and the crew had a trolley full of wine and champagne net effect the crew really struggled to effectively serve hot drinks to a full cabin they did just about manage but its obvious here whoever makes the catering decisions at saa has done so to make hisher life easier not the crew or the passengers
1971,air italy,4,seat slightly more comfortable,milan to sharm el sheikh in september 2018 we flew air italy 737 max 8 before it was grounded on 2 business class tickets the seat pitch was so small that even the length of an ipad could not properly fit i complained with the airline and was offered a 100 euro credit which i refused i was asking instead for a credit of the difference between coach and business for two passengers on the milan to sharm el sheikh flight back in september 2018 and while the seat was slightly more comfortable with a few extra cm of pitch the pitch was probably the same to the one in the economy section of the cabin
4857,austrian airlines,3,causing me to miss my last flight,i booked my flight three month in advance my flight got delayed for two hours causing me to miss my last flight to the final destination both flights were austrian airlines i received a hotel voucher but this does not change the fact that i missed a very important day they rebooked me automatically and in the end i have to take two more flights
13214,kuwait airways,1,bad on board service,manila to kuwait seats are ok flat bed seats however you should not expect anything else seems this airline you pay for seat nothing more bad on board service even more terrible ground services flight scheduled at 10am they rescheduled it twice below average business lounge went to hotel airport terrible could not stay there went back
14936,nam air,6,plane has no ife no wifi,yogyakarta to pontianak despite its not peak season the flight is full even for the business class the boarding was smooth we departed on schedule and arrived at pnk slightly ahead on our schedule i got the expensive class for this flight about 13 million rupiah nam air is a medium service airline so they served snack a little bread a pack of cookies and a bottled mineral water the plane is quite old b737500 and was already need of repair to increase comfort to the passengers since the plane has no ife no wifi and no usb charger the flight was a little bumpy on the cruising altitude although the weather seems calm
18532,smartwings,1,a non organised chaos,very poor ventilation during a 5 hour flight this is not only a cost saving measure for the airline but poses a health risk for passengers and crew during covid 19 pandemic boarding and deplaning was a non organised chaos without supervision failure of physical distancing the airline suffers many systemic problems and poor management for years air travel in the czech republic is not competitive and smart wings abuses their position as the only czech airline
7226,cityjet,8,cityjet customer review,flew st helier to cardiff last monday first time with this airline first impressions were good from friendly steward greeting on the front steps but not so good on actual plane fokker 70 showing its age as it was a bit grubby and with heavy wear and tear left it feeling rather old fashioned note the inarm ashtrays i can remember the days of smoking on planes and thank goodness this doesnt happen anymore and overall browny beigeness of the fittings very good service offering hotcoldalcoholic drinks and a sweet or savoury snack not expected but appreciated and the poor steward barely had time to clear up before landing such is the short flight the 23kg baggage allowance must be one of the most generous in the air so good on cj for this overall would fly with them again
4418,ana all nippon airways,3,my surfboard bag was too big,honolulu to tokyo haneda as a traveling surfer i choose an airline that charges the least or in most cases free as your 2nd checked no hassle and stress free this check in was a nightmare as i stood at the counter for 45 minutes because my surfboard bag was too big finally they accepted the bag and charged me 200 but the hassle was not worth it
1021,air berlin,8,good service with reasonable prices,boston to copenhagen via dusseldorf excellent outbound flight with efficient and personal service by cabine crew seamless transfer in dsseldorf return flight with same route delayed departure but on time arrival outstanding purser but desinterested and demotivated cabin crew at least mine counterpart had to check all passengers in biz class while the one assigned to me sat in one of the passengers seats for the last part of the flight overall i would recommend this business class good service with reasonable prices
2204,air malta,4,all in all a poor effort,london gatwick to malta with air malta what can i say but all in all a poor effort on all fronts delayed leaving the uk 30 minutes and seriously delayed leaving malta 7hrs having left the hotel at 630am to catch the 850am flight we missed our connecting flight home and had to book a a subsequent later flight at an additional cost to us they have a serious lack of communication albeit we got vouchers for food and drinks as always they will not comment on what exactly went wrong other than it went tech these things happen but it would be nice to inform you as soon as possible and then keep you updated and just do it as required according to the eu rules and flight delays even when we were told the flight would be leaving at 3pm that did not happen the plane itself looked tired it been through a lot the seating cramped when compared to our island carrier aurigny and their embraer e195 a regional carrier how is this possible also upon vacating the seat i noted how the cushioning remained depressed obviously a well used seat generally the interior of the plane although clean it too looked dated the lack of inflight entertainment is a poor effort the food poor effort once again a filled bread roll and a bottle of water i would rather not bother in fact i didnt when you consider aurginy you will have at least a choice of soft drinksteacoffee and of course water this is certainly not a experience i wish to repeat it ruined a perfectly good holiday ultimately if we ever returned to malta i will ensure my family and i choose an alternative carrier
11237,iberia express,2,have my hand luggage checked,the worst company ever they forced me to have my hand luggage checked last moment because they lacked of space under the seats and once i arrived to my destination i had to wait at least 70 minutes to the stroller and hope i will get my luggage so i lost my airport bus to my city
13886,lion air,6,the usual lion air flight,jakarta to surabaya only 15 minutes delay otherwise the usual lion air flight pretty crew and free checkedin luggage cramped seats that at least did recline and no food or drinks
22783,wizz air,5,definitely not the worst low cost,when i was preparing our trip to the uae i read a lot of reviews about wizz air unfortunately there are no other lowcost airlines flying from yerevan at least other flights are much more expensive i hated wizz air in advance and expected worse i have installed wizz mobile app and i couldnt check in i was getting error something went wrong but i successfully checked in on the wizz site i checked in one person for free got the free random place and i checked second person my wife purchased next to my place for 11 euro this way you can have places near not for twice price we traveled with 1 year child we got 3 cabin baggage places 40x30x20 up to 10kg each included plus stroller for free i have to say that was enough for us we printed boarding cards not boarding passes because airline can take money if you dont have them the experience starting from the airport was fine good people good service comfortable plane food is not included in the ticket definitely not the worst low cost
470,aerolineas argentinas,5,aerolineas argentinas customer review,my flight to buenos aires was not full plenty of room to stretch flight to miami was full because of school vacation big mistake on my part the a330 is uncomfortable in economy when the seat in front of you is reclined you have the tray table pitted against you stomach even if you are not fat the flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the a330 rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally one must slide to the end and climb out i have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in economy horrible considering how packed the flight was the flight attendants were excellent the food was mediocre with two choices pasta or beef and very small servings flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight bathrooms were kept fairly clean movie selection was very good free headphones were provided a very uncomfortable aircraft avoid the a330 economy only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats checkin at eze was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos
16236,porter airlines,2,he was unbelievably rude,when i originally booked my flight i paid all the extra fees to ensure that i could make a change or even cancel and receive a full refund literally less than 12 hours before my flight was set to depart they did a full cancelation of the flight and expected to rebook me days later to arrive at my destination so i chose the option to cancel my flight and rebook with a different airline fast forward to 2 weeks later i still have not received the payment on my credit card so i phoned customer service tonight to inquire and the man i spoke with was the most condescending person i have interacted with in a very long time period he was unbelievably rude cut me off repeatedly and was very sarcastic in his answers when i genuinely asked questions about the airline and their performance then i find iut this whole time itd because they chose to just credit my account rather than my card which was not agreed upon when i first booked the flight thankfully they refunded me fully in the end but the phone call still somehow ended with this man being terribly rude with me for no reason whatsoever i was calm polite and friendly through the whole conversationim not sure what i did so wrong but i certainly will never make the mistake of booking with porter again
14781,monarch airlines,8,pleasantly surprised by the legroom,flew monarch airlines from manchester to porto pleasantly surprised booked an extra legroom seat outbound and was pleasantly surprised by the legroom inbound however was a standard seat and was tight to say the least 510 tall i would certainly opt for extra legroom on future bookings service although buy on board was courteous and efficient and the food quality was actually fine it puts the budget airline british airways to shame being able to pay cash was a bonus outbound was running around an hour late and i received an email from monarch whilst in the airport to say rescheduled which was a nice touch inbound was just as efficient and arrival in manchester was on time overall i would book again providing the flight schedules are suitable
14572,malindo air,4,hard to recommend this airline,bangkok to kuala lumpur this flight run 4 hours late causing me to miss my connecting flight also with malindo air to perth on inquiring with a representative of malindo air in bangkok airport i was told there was nothing they could do and i would have to wait to sort things out when i got to kl airport they did give me a letter stating the plane had been delayed i would have thought they could have made arrangements before i arrived in kl though on arrival in kl i went straight to the transfer desk as i discussed the issue with your representative a very dissatisfied mob formed behind me while a very upset elderly lady experienced a massive misunderstanding with another malindo representative in time things were sorted for me and a hotel food and a flight the next morning was organized which was great however i didnt reach my hotel until over four hours later some staff were very good however it became obvious that processes and staff training were in need of being fine tuned after only 4 hours at my hotel i was driven back to the airport very early jay at kl was very helpful and although he assured me my luggage would be handled by them when arriving in perth later that day there was no sign of it i arranged to have it sent to my address however this didnt happen instead it was flown to albany airport where i had to drive an hour there and back to pick it up while on the flight from kl to perth i found the crew to be less than helpful i had paid for a meal including a drink of water for the second flight that i had missed because of the delayed flight i showed them evidence of this but they still argued about providing me with a meal i also outlined the bigger picture they were still very reluctant to provide me with the meal i had paid for they tried to tell me that the document i was showing them was for the cost of the flight it was an add on which it clearly stated they even told me i should not be arguing with them all i was doing was asking to have a meal provided that was paid for under the circumstances it would have been wise to make it complimentary anyway the food was horrible even though the airline did some good things and some of their staff performed well late flights yes the second flight didnt run on time either lost luggage argumentative staff and slow processes its makes it incredibly hard to recommend this airline
6024,british airways,4,pilot apologise at every step of the way,flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late there was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated when ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay which people did the pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork after this was resolved the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again so after rushing to sit quickly we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour which is longer than the flight takes of course ams is not bas home base and it uses contracted staff here but it should require a better level of service it was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way itll be eurostar for me next time
5789,blue1,7,blue1 customer review,helosl checkin was rude and dismissive but otherwise the flight had very nice crew and the plane was spotless clean as well bob meal is cheaper on blue1 than on sas due to the currency and i found the quality to be rather reasonable as well ontime departure and arrival in oslo ticket price was great as usual
12659,jin air,7,jin air customer review,hkgcheju return a special chartered flight this is a new budget airline mostly using the old aircraft of korean air domestic all economy with 33 seating check in at hk airport was painfully slow but its made up for with courteous service onboard cabin crew are smartly dressed creating an energetic image for a 3 hour flight juice and coffee as well as a snack box are provided free no tv or any forms of inflight entertainment so be sure to bring your own overall the experience was a pleasant one if the ticket price is right i dont mind to fly with them again
5052,avianca,2,do not fly them,this was hopefully my last and first time flying with this airline i have never ever flown internationally with a company that offers no free beverages no food even on an overnight flight of over 6 hours if you want water you pay if you want to eat there are almost no options and guess what you pay that is normal on domestic flights but on international flights unheard of no entertainment on a 6 hour flight from bogota to sao paulo i had premium seats on one leg selected months ago and with an email confirmation from them when i show up at checkin they say there are no seats available on that class i showed them my email confirmation and all the lady could say is we are in brazil we have no customer service here you have to take it up with avianca when you get home all in all do not fly them unless it is absolutely the last option plus it wasnt cheap either
9811,flydubai,4,i am very unhappy with this flight,i am very unhappy with this flight i paid almost 2000 dhs for a short trip they served the food until the middle of the plane and after that they said there was no option to choose a meal and also they served coffee to the first 5 or 6 rows and stopped and they said it is for your safety this is not comparable with emirates
6928,china eastern airlines,7,frequent drink rounds,shanghai to hong kong came from budapest and had a smooth transit in shanghai where i boarded the china eastern flight to hongkong on an a321 it was early morning 2nd january 2020 priority boarding at gate as sky team silver card onboard newspapers were given chinese shared monitors showed some educational movies from underwater sea world which was nice and informative texted in english food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits drinks were unlimited water tea coffee beers but only for 1 hour while the flight lasted additional 50 minutes during descend services closed down until landing that leaves passengers with very limited time of service fas were fine frequent drink rounds button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly fair legacy carrier service without pay cheap ticket better product than for most european carriers luggage transfer faultless in custody inspected by customs which left a note nothing missing full flight on time mileage rendered to skyteam account jetties availed for aircraft entering and exit what is needed is a hot meal extended time of service and individual ife
12779,kenya airways,8,great flight,first time in kenya airways and all was good they had an email upgrade offer to either business class or to have the seat next to you vacant i chose the latter as it was only 45 and an hour ten flight check in was friendly and easy zanzibar airport has a new terminal but there is literally one restaurant and one shop nothing else so was stuck with all my taz currency as there was nothing to buy boarding was quick fa greeting at the door had my seat next to me open as promised so lots of space smooth take off and drink and snack service for the flight no inflight entertainment but for a short flight who cares landed early and bags off once we were thru immigration great flight
11852,japan airlines,8,great impressions and respect,tokyo narita to busan this return flight in october gave me great impressions and respect for japan airlines the highlight was the presentation and quality of the meal the busan bound flight had a beautiful bento box presented like a gift food inside was the yummiest airplane food ive ever tasted in both flights i had the luck of sitting on exit row seat however the width of the seat gave a cramped feeling the aircon didnt work well interior tapestry was worn and old the service and politeness from the flight attendants was amazing though the tokyo bound flight was delayed by 5 hours due to typhoon the jal staff at busan airport worked so hard with good organization skills to keep every passenger informed providing extra support and apologizing at times with bows even after arrival in tokyo this and many other factors no wonder jal is a 5star airline
20940,tui airways,2,i would avoid at all costs,first time travelling with tui i have to say the service offering for a nearly 6 hour flight was far from adequate tui class this route as mid haul so its buy onboard it would be fine if you had the option to preorder meals like jet2 offer but they done there were 2 trolley services and the cabin crew appeared disinterested and rather unfriendly its also a cashless airline they only allow you to use a creditdebit card and unable to accept pre pay cards like revolut or monzo again not helpful as there is no alternative then to buy onboard the 7378 max whilst nice and new simply isnt big enough for this length of flight with only 3 toilets and no ife the queues for toilets were 10 deep for most of the flight for the reasons above and it feeling like a cash grab by tui i would avoid at all costs they really could learn a thing or 2 from jet2 who seem to have got this kind of flying spot on
1082,air berlin,5,noticed a steady decline,stockholm to berlin i frequently fly with air berlin since a few years back and have recently noticed a steady decline in the quality of the service first air berlin started charging for baggage then they wouldnt let you select a seat and recently they removed the free drinks and snacks i have not noticed any difference in the prices other than this several other experiences have negatively affected my opinion recently my girlfriends bags were lost by air berlin for the second time and they promised she would get a refund for everything we even called the support to make sure however all she got was a coupon to use when booking flights through the ab website the value of the coupon was 13 of what the clothes cost as for my personal experiences a few months ago i missed a connecting flight because of the first flight was delayed the lady at the service desk told me that i would not get anything because i had more than enough time to make it eventhough i ran as fast as i could as for the positive the planes are rather clean and the prices are decent also air berlin flies to txl
20032,thai airways,1,be very wary of packing additional weight,how can any airline justify charging 37 pounds per kilo or 745 pounds for a standard 20kg of extra luggage when i spoke with the thai airways representative he agreed it was high but wasnt able to help im thankful we looked into this before as we were planning to bring an additional suitcase and pay at the airport which apparently is closer to 60 pounds per kg anyone flying thai airways be very wary of packing additional weight
22292,vlm airlines,4,vlm airlines customer review,lcyams clean newly refurbished f50 comfortable seats and good catering attentive crew ontime way better than klm cityhopper
6251,bulgaria air,4,my biggest problem however was legroom,lisbon to sofia with bulgaria air tasty sandwich served onboard along with complementary bottle of water on boarding which is a nice touch however for a four hour flight it didnt seem enough the aircraft seemed very old and almost decrepit with very worn out leather seats it was the first time i feared for safety when travelling there was much turbulence on departure from portugal cabin crew were young and rather unprofessional they seemed as if they wouldnt want to be bother the flight departed and landed precisely on time my biggest problem however was legroom which made this night flight atrocious
12459,jetstar asia,7,good budget airline,manila to osaka checkin was quick and smooth we were handed our boarding passes with our preassigned max legroom seats our prereserved meals were served promptly as soon as the plane reached cruising altitude my black pepper chicken was hot and tasty the flight was half full but service was so so the crew just went about their duties perfunctorily we enjoyed the lounge access in kix that came with the fare bundle upgrade it also came with priority boarding which was a nice touch it was pretty much the same story with our return flight after 5 days good budget airline i would fly them again
1561,air dolomiti,4,air dolomiti customer review,muctrn air dolomiti has own check in gate area in muc with italian flair espresso etc bussing from gate to aircraft in muc was quick hand baggage can be delivered to ac hold if not checked in atr42 or 72 leather seats quite a lot of legroom small snack served on evening service choice of drinks fas english was good on time arrival in trn if they flew regional jets flight time could be reduced against turboprops inflight magazine was well presented all in all a pleasant flight for a late evening

16384,qantas airways,3,very disappointed in qantas,this was my worst travel experience with qantas i flew with them before but their quality seems to be going downhill i flew to singapore via brisbane i was only informed at the airport that my flight from brisbane to singapore was delayed 8hours no prior notification received through email or even their own app whatsoever when i landed in brisbane at least they could have given me vouchers or something or access to their airport lounge for such a long delay very disappointed in qantas
10597,goair,1,very unprofessional,mumbai to delhi very unprofessional will never recommend anyone to travel by goair i have done booking for 18th july 20 they have rescheduled it to 19th july without intimating me they dont even answer any call or reply any email which is really disappointing worst airline and customer service
17902,shanghai airlines,4,shanghai airlines customer review,gimpo seoul to shanghai return ground staff good flight attendants helpful even receiving a beer prior to takeoff first flight was gimposhanghai uncomfortable takeoff but after that no problems shanghaigimpo return no complaints good staff no entertainment but is a short flight good landing and on time no problems i would recommend this airline from a cost perspective but that would be all the best part was the 757 great aircraft
13942,loganair,1,we will never book with loganair again,if i could wind the clock back i definitely would not book with loganair firstly after booking and having chosen our flights we got an email saying both flights were to be moved to early morning which would mean the added expense of an overnight stay at an airport hotel for us then when we needed to cancel because our son had to attend gcse revision sessions we discovered there was no way of cancelling the only option was to change flights which we did not want to do and even this would incur a charge that was nearly as much as the flights in the first place we will never book with loganair again and would recommend that anybody considering it looks elsewhere if at all possible
15634,onur air,4,onur air customer review,manchester to bodrum was great quick check in and fairly comfy plane seats although we were a little disappointed there was no entertainment but that was our own fault for not checking never buy food on a plane anyway so that wasnt too much of a problem coming back we found the journey quite itchy and upon arrival at manchester found ourselves covered in bites these appear to be either bedbugs or fleas caught off the plane we are now in the process of complaining
2915,air tahiti nui,2,recommend avoiding air tahiti nui,i would recommend avoiding air tahiti nui our outbound flight from the us was uneventful the plane however was in poor shape with threadbare carpet outdated seatback entertainment some flights dont even have screens sagging seatback pockets and below average food and service the flight was ontime though and we were headed to paradise so we could overlook these minor issues even though the flight cost even for an economy ticket was at a premium price point on our return trip is where we ran into serious issues there was a mechanical delay on our flight which postponed our departure for 24 hours we waited in line for 3 hours before we had the delay and rebooking information however and were told that there was no possibility of being moved to one of the three other pptlax flights that air tahiti nui had before our rescheduled flight left they put us up in a nice hotel overnight so we werent too upset at spending another day in papeete we had booked all of our ongoing flights out of lax on our own due to my wife and i parting ways after the trip and her complicated international travel upon getting to the hotel i began the process of rebooking all of those flights as we were given the new departure information the following night after breakfast the following morning we were feeling pretty good about everything when i just happened to check the air tahiti nui website to see if our flight was still on time nope we were delayed another 9 hours which then caused us to miss all of our rebooked connections from lax we did not receive any notification from the airline about this additional delay at this point air tahiti nui really let us down they did not rebook us on any of the other departing flights for lax they had no consideration for connecting flights in order for my wife to make her destination in time we had to reroute her on another air tahiti nui flight to tokyonarita they would not apply any of the funds we used for the pptlax flight nor would they simply book her on that flight at no cost due to the mechanical issue when we spoke to customer service we had to find all of our own solutions due to their incompetence and lack of understanding to top it all off they were completely indifferent and unapologetic to this day almost one month later we have not been engaged by their customer service department for reparations after repeated emails and phone calls based on our experience i would recommend a few things there are other carriers that fly tofrom tahiti air france hawaiian air etc look into them and see if they are an option for you take a vacation somewhere else there are a lot of nice spots in the world and while tahiti is exotic and amazing our poor air travel and all that followed totally clouded our experience if you still decide to go and to go with air tahiti nui try to book all of your air travel through them on one ticket or if you are booking your own connections be sure to have some flexibility on your us arrival a day or two in la on the back end
16190,pobeda airlines,2,the flight has been missed,moscow to badenbaden during the checkin there were no separate table for baggage drop off therefore there was one queue for the people who was not registered and for the people who had been already registered we spent 40 minutes in the queue in order to leave a baggage according my opinion the number of staff from the air company who were involved in registering passengers was not sufficient at all we dropped off the baggage nearly at the end of the registration to the flight ie it means the only 15 minutes left to go through the customs and etc as a result the flight has been missed
20581,tigerair,7,ground staff polite and kind,singapore to surabaya tr2260 with tigerair a320 the flight depart and arrive on time the ground staff was polite and kind boarding was quick and smooth and cabin crew greeted us warmly the price was not very expensive thus we decide to choose tigerair the seat was an lcc standard overall it was a nice flight with tigerair
10435,germanwings,4,germanwings customer review,29th july 2013 flight 4u838 from cologne to bologna flight was the second of two that day with the same airline flight delayed 1 hour due to the late arrival of the inbound flight staff kept the passengers informed in a polite and professional manner boarding was orderly and sensibly managed the cabin crew warmly welcomed the passengers the flight had severe turbulence and the crew did little to allay the fears of passengers the lady pilot made a few semiaudible announcements and did seemed to be focused on making up for the delay disembarkation was chaotic as italian passengers pushed to exit the flight the cabin crew did nothing to try and control what could have been a dangerous situation the fare was not the cheapest of fares on offer and due to the abrupt manner of the cabin crew on this flight my experience of germanwings has been soured somewhat i wont use germanwings on this route again
10661,greater bay airlines,6,cost can add up quick,take this airline if you plan on traveling light it is a low cost airline so if you plan on purchasing check in luggage cost can add up quick i dont expect service from a low cost airline but at least the flight attendants offer us free bottle of water as the flight took off food has to be purchased prior boarding
5156,ba cityflyer,3,service was atrocious,london city to mykonos i usually love ba cityflyer from lcy really good airline nice planes and plenty of room this trip we flew club europe to mykonos a 3hour 45min flight the service was atrocious there is no ba lounge at lcy so really the only differentiation is the onboard product they should really make an effort the crew spend most of the flight chatting in the galley they eventually came out after 50 minutes and gave us a drink food was good but they did not provide icecream or desert as per the menu the csm dropped a salad at my feet tomato all up my legs and on my shoes without an apology the remnants just sat there for the rest of the flight being trodden into the carpet no tea and coffee was offered no hot towels in fact there was very little engagement with any passengers this was not a bust flight there was no turbulence or other reason for a lack of service it really did just appear that the crew could not be bothered such a shame when a business ticket on this flight costs nearly 300 one way on a positive note we flew back in economy and the service was far superior this may have just been a bad experience but come on ba you should be delivering what you advertise i have complained but i guess it will fall on deaf ears
12578,jetstar pacific,5,very little room in the cabin,hanoi to guangzhou i booked this flight through ctrip paying via my unionpay bank debit card and then attempted to add luggage but was told that i could only do this using a credit card which i do not have as foreigners are not allowed credit cards and i dont have a mastercard or visa i spoke with the jetstar call centre who insisted that they could only take credit cards and fobbed me off to ctrip who the agent claimed could accept the payment via debit card but in fact they struggled to even get their head around the issue chinese speaker and then couldnt accept any such payment or so they claimed in the end i had to go to the ends of the earth to find someone who does have access to allusive visa card or pay at the counter at which point it would be cheaper to charter my own plane home the flight much my surprise set off on time and landed on time with no issues everything was very basic no free drinks service and very little room in the cabin but the announcements were understandable in english and their staff on the check in desk were polite and remembered me to say hello at the boarding point which is always nice
4516,arik air,5,arik air customer review,leg room on a340 gives a generous pitch and baggage allowance is a generous 30 kilos inflight entertainment was very poor they didnt provide headphones i was told the ife did not work in some seats eventually i was given headphones and told to try my luck quality was very poor the food was very bland and the portions small i was within the first 20 and told the beef had run out crew were polite enough but i didnt get the impression of being greatly experienced fly arik if you want a comfortable seat and have a lot of luggage if inflight entertainment food and service is important to you stay well clear
17304,ryanair,6,pleasant flight for a decent fare,a pleasant flight for a decent fare and on time leg space remains a problem cabin crew were attentive and cheerful what i appreciate most with them is that they try to achieve boarding and leaving the aircraft swiftly as they are always on a rushed schedule
12129,jet2com,2,smartlynx ancient a320 extremely poor,leeds bradford to faro flew with this airline because of its reputation as being a cut above its budget rivals legroom is usually better and the new slimline seating more comfortable this time without warning the flight was operated by smartlynx on an ancient a320 with extremely poor and uncomfortable seating and a tiny amount of legroom my thoughts are jet2 should have given me the option to rebook or cancel this flight
2046,air koryo,7,air koryo customer review,on both legs beijing pyongyang beijing the plane was a more than decent tu 204 with a reasonable seat pitch check in fast and efficient both at pyongyang and beijing check in staff also turned a blind eye of a 2 kgs excess i had on both legs this airline is an experience in itself propaganda is on air during the whole flight with dprk music complimentary inflight service with local both soft and alcoholic drinks deplaning at pyongyang fast with rapid baggage delivery in less than 30 minutes i was on my way escorted by guides to the hotel
9158,eva air,4,selection is for asian passengers,starting from the boarding experience in vienna where they put you in a confined place for 3040 minutes with no seating some of the cabin crew serving me were lacking the basic communication and service skills infotainment system was working properly but a lot of the selection is for asian passengers headphones provided to me were of a low quality before to exit your seat to the toilet you need to climb out
18386,sky express airlines,5,its about the principle,travelling from new york to athens and from athens to chania i had an extra luggage that i knew i will be charged no problem the girl charge me by mistake for 2 extra luggage it wasnt enough time to go back for my refund because my plane was leaving so i email the company they said its not refundable for what for their mistake its not fair its not about the money its about the principle of the situation
7306,comair,8,efficient and personable,thoroughly workmanlike return flights johannesburg to cape town cabin crew were efficient and personable seats 1ac had adequate leg room food was adequate and it was helpful to see the three main courses before choosing one both flights arrived ahead of schedule
21262,turkmenistan airlines,5,seats cheapest ever,ashkabat to bangkok as other flight from paris 23 full so easy to move seats food was worse this flight barely edible plenty of soft drinks but never had someone hand me a packet of instant coffee and a cup of boiling water seats cheapest ever no in flight entertainment except overhead map was way too warm and try getting any staff to come through during flight is impossible for second time someone lighting up a cigarette and no announcement to stop it stunk up the place flight was on time landed early plane seemed new but like other 737 they got the absolute cheapest configuration i would fly again if i was assured the 737800 but not the 757200 as they are 25 years old
11261,iberia express,4,unpleasant and unfriendly staff,madrid to santa cruz de la palma with iberia express too small space for legs if you are over 180 cm quite unpleasant and unfriendly staff like most iberia staff with very limited knowledge of english
22983,xiamen airlines,6,they provided a free hotel,amsterdam from taipei with 11 hours layover in xiamen they provided a free hotel accommodation for passengers with a long layover at xiamen the 737800 has a newer interior than the one i was in on my way to taipei the boeing 787 the same as the one on my way to taipei both flights were on time we had a constant turbulence on the first couple hours on the second leg of my journey so the meal service was suspended accordingly the flight attendants acted quickly as soon as we flew in a clean air again and resumed the meal service there were a significant number of babiestoddlers on the flight to amsterdam and most of them were crying and screaming constantly airlines should limit the amount of babiestoddlers on board for long haul flights simply unfair for the other 200 passengers it must also be a torture for those kids too
6628,cathay pacific airways,9,a pleasant flight,a pleasant flight i traveled with them on the airbus a330300 from chengdu to hong kong a great flight and excellent service in the air and on the ground i have never been disappointed in cathay pacific
4370,ana all nippon airways,1,deserves its 5star rating,ana should offer classes to other airlines on how to treat customersthey are so good in so many ways first of all economy class seats are comfortable and pretty roomy the meals are generous interesting and tasty and the staff are just the best always giving service with a smile they engage passengers at every turn japan is a country known for its good service and the crew on this flight was the embodiment of the japanese service standard on this flight there was a full lunch with several dishes and then later a pretty tasty snack video choices are excellent and live tv is offered as well it is a fine airline and deserves its 5star rating
4398,ana all nippon airways,9,the best airline experience,manila to vancouver via tokyo as part filipino and part japanese im proud to say that the presentation of the safety video is very nostalgic and very cultural which is what i love the effort cleanliness quality and excellent service of the japanese food and care from the flight attendants is superior the food tastes freshly steamed and cooked with juicy flavors from the main dish whereas the small side dishes tastes great plus mini ice cream for dessert entertainment was great too i even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact reminding to wear your seatbelt and pa announcements on the mini tv screen the cleanliness in the aircraft the space and comfortably is superb my only concern is the room space for the leg space for the economy class in the very back seat which is connected to the wall either way the seat itself with the pillows and the blankets are pretty comfortable and clean i highly recommend to anyone to look into ana their honesty about operating during a pandemic crisis like at this time is strongly recommended to those who are struggling to return to their homes i would like to say thank you so much again for your hard work and effort and for taking us home safely during this pandemic as its tough to work through this crisis this is the best airline experience i had been through
3888,alaska airlines,3,a frustrating experience,i had a frustrating experience with alaska i got a round trip from san jose to san diego with my family and among the free items you can checkin are strollers and car seats on the first flight we were able to checkin for free our sons car seat and wagonstroller for free we even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagonstroller with us for free however on the return flight we had to pay to document and checkin the wagonstroller the handling of situation was terrible from alaska they argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape the personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not even though our could be smaller we showed them the model on the internet which states it is a stroller wagon and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers they argued that allowing us to checkin our wagon for free during our first flight was a mistake to make matters even worse the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller this suggested to me that alaska didnt care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on alaskas policies which alaska was not able to provide along this lines about not really being helpful and taking their attitude to a different level one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to solve the problem threatened us by saying do you want to fly today not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse in the end a more cool headed personnel came in acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain this frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented inconsistent policies and communication channels at alaska and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from alaska employees at the san diego airport i will avoid using alaska in the future as it is not worth the stress
3987,alitalia,2,attitude of crew was terrible,i have travelled with alitalia for more than 20 years and though out this time quality of service and employees attitude has been going up and down in the last three trips however i experienced the worst possible service on both sides old plane flying the intercontinental route low cost type of searing front and back seats broken poor food quality as well as entertainment the attitude of the crew was terrible you can manage one person with a bad day but when three or four through the journey are unnecessarily unpleasant i really wish i had more options to fly out of miami
20832,transavia,5,they do not impress with anything,they are ok but they do not impress with anything they usually leave a little later than scheduled and they dont serve anything for free unlike klm
12423,jetstar asia,3,baggage policy absolutely ridiculous,singapore to bangkok general comment on jetstar asia baggage policy it is absolutely ridiculous 7kg combined hand luggage is not enough for a day trip i was charged 65 sg for an 82kg laptop bag how i was treated during the weighing and payment process was disgraceful i will never fly this airline again i am a regular business and personal flyer 60 flights per year i will avoid at all costs
11439,insel air,7,attendants kind and attentive,we were flying insel air from st maarten to curacao we quickly passed through check in and security the flight was delayed by 23 hours coming from santo domingo so we just sat in the almost empty terminal we boarded via the stairs the aircraft wasnt the cleanest and it had the not so pretty green alitalia seats and there was water leaking from the ac vents a few rows behind me we were served a little snack on the flight and there was a raffle in which you can win back your ticket the flight attendants were kind and attentive
20530,tigerair,1,online checkin was unavailable,i booked tickets from narita to taipei i flew into narita from the us an airport employee told us to go through the transfer gates for our connecting flight we showed up at the gate an hour and a half before boarding the employee refused to print out our tickets and let us board he said that we had to go through customs and checkin at the counter outside this was not stated on our tickets and we tried to checkin online but the tigerair manager working there said the online checkin was unavailable due to covid we had to book a different airline and tigerair refused to give us our tickets or money back
5442,batik air,4,disorganized and chaotic,the checkin was extremely disorganized and chaotic all the destinations were lumped together resulting in people yelling changing queues etc several customers missed their flights which could have been avoided if the airline had organized the check in counters by say langkawi singapore bali etc but the airplane itself was clean and the crew was courteous
7361,condor airlines,3,boarding process is terrible,pros cheaper than most other airlines from seattle to europe so i will give them a couple of stars for that but if all of the airlines were around the same price i would never fly this one again cons website is very difficult to navigate finally ended up booking ticket on expedia which took 5 minutes as opposed to the amount of time and frustration i expended trying to book on the condor website boarding process is terrible in both seattle and frankfurt no priority boarding for bclass no boarding by groups or rows no announcements by ground staff in frankfurt it looked like they didnt even give priority to people with disabilities and parents with young children complete chaos staff on board are ok but most are not particularly friendly seat on one leg was beatup and required constant shoving of bottom of seat to slide under top part of seat to keep bottom from sliding forward 4food is terrible
8098,dragonair,3,dragonair customer review,return of the outward flight two weeks ago and just as bad very late arrival poor beverage it seems that this airline cannot fly on time i checked everyday whether this plane has flown in the last two weeks and it has only been on time once it was cheap so i guess i should expect it they also seem to find it difficult to accredit one world miles
16835,rossiya airlines,2,rossiya airlines customer review,fv245 ledfra 7913 fv246 fraled 14913 flew this airline last month to and from frankfurtmain on vacation the fare was quite high but i had connection with other family members in fra so had no choice the airbus a320 was okay satisfactory and clean the seat pitch well im 182m and it is rare that an aircraft is comfortable for me this one wasnt but its a common issue the flight itself was okay the flight crew were informative the cabin crew were terrible not a single smile unkind and impolite fellow passengers asked about the reasons for the delay and got a very rude answer inflight meal was awful as always cant review the ground staff since i had an internet checkin which took me half an hour to deal with the inbound flight was on time the return was 15 hours late transit passengers lost their connection flights the bottom line is that this is the worst not lowcost company i have flown with
10026,french bee,8,good value for money,despite seeing poor reviews we decided to book using this airline i had never heard of as the timing of their flight to tahiti worked for us we had low expectations realizing we would have to pay for everything from bags to meals we were so pleasantly surprised clean modern plane good entertainment system friendly cabin crew ok meal and of most surprise good legroom in economy with a good recline for the seats the flight was on time i would therefore recommend this airline good value for money
13150,kuwait airways,3,disinterested unfriendly crew,this was a short journey from qatar to kuwait and my first time flying kuwait airways left doha about 5min early and landed in kwi some 20min ahead of schedule a friendly and warm welcome from the lady i guess she was the inflight manager at the aircraft door and that was where all the pleasantries or smiles ended the other flight attendants positioned throughout the cabin looked surly and and greeted 3 of them as i walked to my seat at the end of the aircraft not a single one acknowledged my hello good morning the end of the safety video was still playing as we entered the runway for takeoff naturally the cabin crew were not checking seat belts were fastened and seats were up as for the service a snack box was offered but neither myself nor a man seating opposite me received it when the miserable and unprofessional looking crew were collecting the empty boxes the man seating on the opposite aisle seat to me asked one of the cabin crew if he could please have a snack box as he never got one with an eye roll and a sigh the crew member went to the galley and brought the man a box all this without a word to the passenger never mind an apology the kind man on the aisle opposite to me not travelling with me even mentioned to the same attendant i had not received a snack box either however the crew member glanced at me and went back to the galley i do fly for work about a month ago and i cannot remember flying with such a disinterested unfriendly crew i was so thankful it was only a 1hour flight i will ask my company never to book me with kuwait airways again

4758,aurigny air,7,aurigny air customer review,gatwick guernsey return atr72 clean and tidy both legs on time seat pitch tight if you are tall but acceptable for 45 minute flights complimentary soft drink cabin crew working fast to complete full service in tight time constraints overall a good regional carrier but with one irritating gripe there is a 3 fee to choose your seat in advance this under the current climate is not too bad however if you book a fully flexible ticket and subsequently change your flight although there is obviously no fee for changing your flight you will be expected to pay the 3 again if you want to choose a seat on the new flight if you are on a flexible ticket you should really only have to pay the fee for choosing a seat once
16521,qantaslink,9,qantaslink customer review,mkybnemlb return overall positive experience ontime friendly courteous staff clean aircraft with plenty of legroom nice snackfood and bar service on the evening flight back to mky qantas is still my preferred airline
14516,malindo air,4,crew made a good first impression,i didnt have high expectations from malindo air but despite this my flight was a disappointment on various fronts new years eve is not a busy time to fly and as expected the flight was only 60 full the crew made a good first impression but the flaws started appearing early in the flight both lavatories had not a drop of soap in them and the crew confirmed they have no soap at all the temperature inside the cabin was very cold and if this wasnt bad enough the air conditioning was blowing at full force this was true even once we landed and waited to disembark the onboard meals are reasonably priced but they come with only one a 350 ml water the menu doesnt display prices for water bottles only soft drinks the cabin was clean and the crew provides good service
20732,tigerair taiwan,1,dont have to compensate,taipei to nagoya tigerair is great until they decide to change your flight time due to operational reasons the evening before my morning flight to nagoya i received an email informing me of a 25h delay as a result all my travel and hotel arrangements of that day had to be rebooked of course there are no refund at at such short notice i called the call center twice in order to receive a flight credit or at least let me change the flight to another one i was ready to pay the markup however they hid behind the small print stating that they dont have to compensate or allow me to change the flight if the delay is due to operational reasons i talked to two call center staffs and one staff at the airport the last one acted as if he wanted to help but made up another excuse the other flight that day being full when there still were several seats available on their website when i see people yelling at airport staff i always wonder if that actually helps i certainly felt like that inside i know the staff is just following their internal rules so i dont like blaming them but lying to my face while apologizing was a bit much even a lcc should have a little leeway when they are clearly about to lose a customer you can spend your dollars on advertisement campaigns or not losing customers and their network
2470,air namibia,6,air namibia customer review,i had booked a return trip from lgw to whk about 2 weeks before my scheduled departure from gatwick i stumbled across information by chance on the internet that air namibia had axed all its flights from gatwick they never informed me of it at all later i found out it was because i had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent people who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently so i phoned their representatives who were still active in london the agent who took my call was very helpful though she rescheduled my flight without issues with ba via frankfurt she had also assured me that i could check my bags straight through from heathrow to windhoek of course this ended up not being the case the lady at the ba counter at heathrow knew of no such cooperation with air namibia she said i had to recheck the bags in at frankfurt i didnt mind though otherwise my flights were on time and i got to windhoek without any other hassle the return journey was flawless bags checked through all the way to heathrow from windhoek via frankfurt i would fly them again
12799,kenya airways,1,it was a bad experience,it was a bad experience i had a flight from entebbe to nairobi and from nairobi to amsterdam i missed the first one and went straight to nairobi seemed that they canceled the whole flight i had to go to sales and they without explaining any detail told me i had to pay 475 dollars for a new flight as i had no time at all i had to make a quick decision but after i tried to ask for answers but i did not get any good explanation beside that i had to pay the difference bad customer service and lousy way to dealing with people
19146,sriwijaya air,7,overall experience is nice,flew from jakarta to makassar my overall experience is nice the flight is ontime maybe because my flight is the earliest flight of the day the staff is fine and the flight is rather boring but on my 2 hours and 20 minutes flight hot food was distributed the food is rather bland but hot food is still a hot food overall i could recommend my tip for sriwijaya is select the earliest flight out
18239,singapore airlines,5,totally disappointing,the a380 layout is nice in appearance but i have never experienced a business class seat that requires you to lay at an angle in order to use the footrest space the seats were the hardest i have ever encountered in business class very uncomfortable my seat on my outbound or return flights operated properly and i had to call for flight attendant assistance numerous times when the seat buttons simply failed to work no amenity kits were provided which was a 1st for any business class flight i have experienced you had to request eye shades ear plugs or slippers with razors combs toothbrushes etc available in the restrooms it was a significant time after boarding before any drinks were served but it was only juice or water no champagne was offered food in both directions were mediocre at best wine offerings were insulting flight attendants pour no more than 2 into the small glasses since that was the serving in the 3 requests we made the cabin staff were polite courteous professional but not nearly as service oriented as qatar or many other 5star airlines we found it quite telling that sg used the air india lounge for their business class passengers at jfk even though air india is regularly rated as 1 of the lowest quality airlines worldwide at least at fra they used air canadas lounge which was a major improvement but there was zero preference for business class passengers at fra boarding overall we found them to be totally disappointing and it failed to deliver the same quality business class service i have had on many other carriers
16899,royal air maroc,7,not a bad series of flights,london to banjul via casablanca left heathrow on timefull flight for casablanca evening meal served tasty beef stew left casablanca for gambia this time i chose chicken out of the same two options as the london flight cabin crew efficient and we landed on time return trip another 737 left at 2 am for casablancaplane full and on timeserved a strange boxed mealsnack long wait at casablanca 6 hrs plus as per scheduleairport is new booked the lounge to wait nothing specialbut the airport itself was clean and bright last flight casablanca to london delayed a bit because of storm dennis they served a hot meal which was ok landed late but safely having stacked at heathrow waiting for storm and other aircraft to land although all flights were 737800 the vintage and layout of each was different but legroom was ok no individual screens on them not a bad series of flights crews were seasoned and unobstrusive
9388,fiji airways,3,carry on didnt fit the basket,after arriving to nadi from los angeles and i had a connecting flight to labasa after checking at the counter i was told to place my carry on in a basket to check the size when my carry on didnt fit the basket i was told to pay 90 i explained that i have a connecting flight from lax and this particular carry on was good and met the cabin size she refused to listen to me and demanded that i pay the said amount baggage information
17366,s7 siberia airlines,7,a pleasant experience,palma de mallorca to moscow checkin was a breeze the aircraft was new and clean seats were in a 22 layout and were comfortable cabin crew were polite professional and efficient in terms of catering the greek salad and the desert were fantastic a prelanding fresh applecucumbermint juice was a fantastic touch huge kudos to the airlines creative team the design of boarding passes reading and marketing materials and the aircraft livery are definitely making s7 one of the most stylish airlines in the world flight delayed by about 30 minutes due to heavy traffic not the fault of the airline hot meal options were mediocre at best no ife for a 45 hour flight the ticket price was expensive and comparable to aeroflot overall a pleasant experience with s7 airlines up to its possibilities the airline delivers a great product in terms of quality though you would expect a lower price tag for what was on offer
15119,nok air,4,passenger service nosedived,i have frequently used nok air for flights within thailand and have found the airline consistently good even after its recent problems with pilots and working hours i took it for a recent weekend in the northeast city of udon thani for whatever reason as other posters have pointed out standards of passenger service have nosedived economy checkin for a midday flight was split between two aisles covering all the airlines flights with just 3 counters open on one and 2 on the other unfortunately i was in the other queue with about 40 passengers ahead of me that in itself would have presented little problem except two separate passengers had their passports locked in their suitcases then despite the rule of one onboard cabin bag with a max weight of 7kgs 8 others in the queue had at least two largish bags and of course when they got to the checkin desk a lot more time was wasted opening and re packing all the time the checkin ladies just sat and watched a couple of desks away was a nok employee just playing with his movie phone the question therefore is realising that these problems arise and given that nok had no less than 3 service representatives floating around that area doing precious little why on earth were they not checking for these particular problems long before the relevant passengers were anywhere near checkin as if that were bad enough once on the aircraft one man boarded with 3 sizeable pieces of luggage one a trolley bag with the considerable difficulty he had hoisting it into the overhead bin that alone clearly weighed well over 7kgs of course low cost carriers have their rules and certain inconvenience is virtually guaranteed but a failure to make simple checks and a failure to enforce rules just makes the experience less bearable
6859,china airlines,7,would recommend for the price,we flew brisbane to london gatwick via taipei and return with china airlines we werent delayed on any of the flights there or back blankets pillows were waiting for us when we boarded on the longer legs taipei gatwick gatwick taipei amenity kits were provided we were in economy so that was a nice little extra the seats were not comfortable at all which is a shame and the food was a little disappointing the cabin service was alright would recommend for the price they were the cheapest tickets at the time of booking
2930,air tahiti nui,7,air tahiti nui customer review,laxpptlax having read some of the reviews on here i was a bit worried about what wed encounter on these flights both were overnight so we tried to sleep and made no use of the entertainment system the aircraft interior was clean and well maintained and the crew were very good breakfast was decent the seat is angled lie flat but reasonably comfortable both flights were on time and bags were off quickly the only downside i could see was the high fares due to i assume lack of competition
9373,fiji airways,9,seats were comfortable,singapore to nadi with fiji airways service excellent and cabin crew were friendly attentive and approachable they ensured customers feel at home during the flight numerous checks offering water juice to passengers seats were comfortable ample legroom for a 59 guy inflight entertainment would be my only gripe i exhausted the list of movies pretty quickly during my flight food is comprehensive and sufficient wide selection 3 choices and they were tasty
2527,air new zealand,5,a very disappointing experience,i booked the ticket with air new zealand using my miles with air canada it was a direct flight from auckland to tokyo overall it was a very disappointing experience the ground staff i encountered was unfriendly and unhelpful to say the least the ground staff member did not listen to my answers so i had to repeat my final destination three times then she kept asking me for the japanese resident card although i told her twice that i was a japanese citizen travelling with a japanese passport which she was already holding i asked for an aisle seat and she never responded to my request i was assigned seat 63k a window seat in the last row of the plane that caused inconvenience not just for me but for the family who was sitting next to me and travelling with young children as i was at the airport three hours before the departure and there was no online checkin i find it difficult to believe that there were no aisle seats available at the time of my checkin i understand the planes can be full and not all customers requests can be met but that should be communicated i still do not know whether the staff member who assisted with my checkin did not hear my request was not able to fulfil it or simply chose to ignore it i travel often and i have been through many airports and checkin counters i rarely encountered staff that was as unfriendly and unhelpful as the staff that i encountered at the air new zealand encounter on january 6 2023 inflight service also needs improvement the meals were basic and repetitive fudge brownie was served three times during the 10hour flight there was no amenity kit that is standard on most international flights the movie selection was also poor in addition the crew did not seem to pay attention to the passengers when drinks were served between the meals which happened rarely the crew seemed to notice only the passengers seating in the aisle seats my general impression was that they did not seem to recognise that they were there to serve the customers compared to asian airlines like ana or korean air air new zealand service leaves a lot to be desired considerable improvements are needed if air new zealand is to compete on the global stage i would think twice before booking the ticket with them again
18309,singapore airlines,9,overall a very good flight,check in was quick and efficient as expected with singapore airlines lounge access was the virgin atlantic clubhouse which at that time of day seemed to be devoted to sq passengers lounge service was excellent with a good selection of food and drinks boarding was on time and very efficient with a personalised welcome on board settling in was very easy as there is so much storage available at the seat and above pre take off drinks were offered but only fruit juice and water no champagne no amenity kits offered except by request food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off and serve with sosatie appetisers meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains book the cook is not available ex johannesburg and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu it is not possible to order not a problem for us as we were near the front decent wines were on offer although a somewhat limited choice food was good as was the service the seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed which is easily done although attendants were quick to help the drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed although in use this was not a particular problem and wwe both slept for most of the flight breakfast was offered as and when people woke and arrival in singapore on time as usual immigration was a breeze our only downside was we found the entertainment system difficult but this is probably an age thing overall a very good flight
3608,airbaltic,6,efficiency and punctuality,a 50minute flight from riga to tallinn on a dash 8 bombardier plane in excellent condition as well as the comfort of the seats the staff during the flight was a bit absent moreover i recommend this company for its efficiency and punctuality
7681,croatia airlines,4,catering less than poor,zagreb to sarajevo with croatia airlines a short flight catering on board was less than poor with just water and crackers if you want juices you have to purchase them the ticket for 50 min flight was extremely expensive 130 one way
10996,hong kong airlines,8,quality airport and inflight service,this is definitely one of the underrated airlines quality airport and inflight service for quite a reasonable price check in and boarding were smooth the pilot has maintained adequate communication with us and the cabin crews were very attentive and helpful the food was not superb but beyond average the cabin crews kept checking us from time to time to see if we need anything else which i asked one of the cabin crews for a refill for my cup and she was gladly to do so seats are average for its class inflight entertainment was great a good selection of shows to choose from for less than a 3 hour flight if you want to get the most bang for your buck i think you can put hong kong airline into the list
14747,mihin lanka,7,crew was quite active,kolkata to colombo average aircraft no ife available legroom is less but seat width is satisfactory crew was quite active throughout the 25 hour flight announcements were clear and audible restrooms were clean but only the rear restroom was allowed for the economy class passengers boarding was smooth food served was scanty but then it was a flight at 3 am so no one was really hungry
7165,citilink,3,compensated the passengers,my flight was supposed to be at 2005 from denpansar to jakarta at around 1830 i received a text message from citilink saying that my flight is delayed to 2150 at the airport when i asked the staff about the delayed time they seemed clueless it was rather confusing since the boarding pass and information board showed the flight time at 2005 after not receiving any news from the staff or from the information board at 2150 they announced that the flight is being delayed again for another 3 hours citilink compensated the passengers with food and isd23
13326,lan airlines,3,plane is a torture chamber,lan airlines boeing 787 was a nice aircraft and the flight crew were good but an extremely poor seat configuration in economy resulting in a tortuous flight for a lightly tall person 183 cm i could not sit straight in my window seat and could not stretch my legs at all my knees jammed into the seat in front even with the seats upright and became very squashed when the front seat was reclined i have flown this route many times 10 over the last 10 years and this was my first flight on the boeing 787 and it was a huge disappointment due to the cramped seating arrangement i heard many others on the flight saying it was the most cramped they had ever been other flights with lans previous aircraft on this route were always pretty good this one was not this plane is a torture chamber for a long haul flight my next flight to chile will be with qantas
4935,avelo airlines,2,lack of communication horrific,boarded flight from pbi to hvn on 123122 during boarding there was an issue as two teens werent allowed to board due to the plane being overweight pilot said that we had to carry extra fuel due to weather in new haven after 45 minutes of a standoff the girls boarded the plane no clue what changed to allow that the first attempt to take off was aborted due to a light going off we pulled off the runway and waited until that cleared so an hour after our scheduled departure we took off we didnt land at our estimated time and it was clear we were circling when we finally landed 20 minutes after the pilot said we would he then announced that we were in hartford once in hartford we were stuck on the tarmac for 90 minutes until a gate opened up when it did we were allowed to deplane with zero communication from flight crew about next steps in fact it was only a bdl employee at the gate that mentioned that our bags werent being unloaded hopefully they will show up in new haven today but weve heard nothing from avelo and its impossible to get through to them i understand that weather happens ive been delayed and diverted before but the lack of communication and safety concerns were horrific
12630,jetstar pacific,6,jetstar pacific customer review,hkg to sin they get the job done and that is about it aircraft was a well maintained a320 legroom was ok for the 35hrs trip cabin crew friendly
14107,lufthansa,6,they were totally inflexible,i flew from so paulo to frankfurt on the 1st june the flight was almost completely full on this 12hour flight we were placed in seats next to a partition with no possibility of any movement to recline the backrest the seat was only completely vertical i spoke with the flight attendants about the problem i noticed that there were 10 or 15 free seats in economyplus premium economy i talked to the team again i spoke about the discomfort of traveling for 12 hours in that seat but they were totally inflexible the 1015 economyplus seats were empty for the entire flight and we had the backrest upright the lack of flexibility and understanding of this discomfort on the part of the onboard team was astonishing
5291,bamboo airways,7,doesnt position itself as low cost,quite uneventful flight was on a very clean and new airplane got a little bottle of water and refreshing towel probably a little biscuit or even small sandwich would have been appropriate as the airline doesnt position itself as low cost but rather full service
21656,vietnam airlines,9,staff courteous and efficient,we have used vietnam airlines on several occasions over the years and have never had issues with them on this occasions we flew ho chi minh hanoi da nang ho chi minh each flight was pleasant staff courteous and efficient and they departed as scheduled as they were relatively short flights the inflight service was minimal however unlike scoot who we flew to ho chi minh with they kept the passenger hydrated the aircraft may not be the most modern however the seats were comfortable there was ample legroom and most importantly they were clean boarding was efficient and easy its unfortunate they dont operate from perth western australia as there would be no need to use any other carrier
2856,air seychelles,5,air seychelles customer review,paris to the seychelles the cabin itself is in good condition the staff seemed a bit awkward and on the return flight was the entire crew were rude and arrogant food was as expected in the economy despite seat reservation i had a different seat in the middle of three i got no answer as to why my seat was changed
4110,alliance air,1,worst airline i have ever dealt with,this is the worst airline i have ever dealt with they cancelled my flight notifying me at 2am with no other reason but cancelled i was due to fly out at 8am so had no prior warning and no support from customer service about rescheduling or any sort of help in getting me and my family to our destination the impact of this flight cancellation meant we had missed our connecting flight to dubai and we were unable to change connecting flight to continue on with our holiday so we had no other alternative but to pay extra and return home our refund for the cancellation should be automatic however 3 weeks on and i am still waiting i have sent 45 emails chasing i have also called their customer service costing me 50 just on call chargers and still have not had a resolution the support technical confirmed my email and request will be processed that same day but a week later and still no resolution there is zero care from this airline i recommend all to avoid booking using this airline
2723,air serbia,9,air connect crew was pleasant,i cant give a full score because there was a 45 minute delay the flight was operated by another company called air connect and its crew was pleasant and the plane clean and modern
17728,scoot,8,definitely my airline of choice in se asia,in my opinion scoot is one of the best lowcost carriers in se asia little sister to singapore airlines they deliver a diluted version of a fivestar airline to the budgetconscious traveller the seats are just fine and the legroom is better than on most budget airlines definitely my airline of choice in se asia
15727,passion air,6,seats had no reclining function,i flew on op178 from accra to tamale in the north of ghana and back two days later the plane is over 15 years old the outside appearance looked good the cabin impression was ok but maybe a bit tired the impression was that the cabin reflects the age of the plane surprisingly there was no shutter for the windows the seats had no reclining function the flight op178 was supposed to leave acc at 1550 boarding at 1510 gate 4 domestic terminal the video screen showed outdated information of op146 a flight which was supposed to leave acc for kumasi at 1030 apparently delayed there was no info of op178 visible also no audio announcements only audio announcements of landed flights boarding started at 1545 without any prior info bus transfer to plane from gate in bus information about boarding procedure rows 110 front door as rear door remained closed all passengers boarded via the front door the flight took off with about 30min delay due to late arrival of the incoming plane according to captain service on board was ok every passenger received a small bottle of water a fruit juice and a little snack some pastry with meat i didnt taste it flight back from tml left on time boarding procedure is a bit easier in tml as there is only one gate and a small waiting area no screens but i really didnt feel the need for it op179 arrived 10min ahead of schedule in acc service was very much the same but this time with the choice of a sandwich chicken or a small danish again i didnt taste either one luggage delivery in tml took surprisingly long in acc it was a short wait
18246,singapore airlines,4,wide ranging cost cutting exercise,what has happened to sq i believe since covid they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers it starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat bring back the old lounges on the flights there are no hot towels no newspapers no nuts before dinner no amenity kits no mattresses food is mediocre the only thing that hasnt changed is the first class cabin crew i have been a flyer with sq for over 25 years and have never known it so bad

800,air arabia,8,the service was very good,flew air arabia from sharjah to muscat and back to sharjah as part of a visa run uae visa change really liked the cabin crew and onboard experience cabin crew were very well presented a lot of the passengers were nonenglish speakers and i noticed the cabin crew were very polite and treated all of them with dignity and respect to help show them to their seats and put away their cabin bags plane was new seats were clean and plane had a freewifi network streaming movietv programme they called it skytime which i used via my smartphone it was fast bought snacks and coffee on board nothing special but the service was very good i am an experienced traveller and i really liked this airline and their onboard experience i would fly with them again

20812,transaero airlines,8,transaero airlines customer review,new york jfk to moscow surprisingly cheap tickets and good service in economy the crew spoke good english and were courteous both meal services were quite nice taking into account free wine selection teacoffee and icecream service in the middle of the flight looked like a compensation for the nonexistent ife program on the overhead projectors and monitors was only in russian
7140,citilink,4,today i missed the flight,pekanbaru to jakarta i am a weekly traveler and fly with this airlines twice a week however today i missed the flight even though i have checked in arrived at the airport early and waiting for more than 1 hour delay the problem is they did not announce boarding call announcement thru pa and information board as they should be they admit that the procedure was not followed and they apologize for it missed the flight no other flight available on the same day wasting time for 5 hours waiting and another 12 hours until flight to jakarta using another airline disappointment and lost trust to the airlines what do i get a sorry a ticket of rescheduled flight to the next month
9766,flydubai,2,worst airline experience,worst airline experience i decided to go with my wife to maldives for our honeymoon i chose flydubai to get from warsaw to male the ticket was around 2030 more expensive than from cheaper airlines i decided to pay more because there was short stopover 34 hours on connecting airport dubai after paying for the flight and getting booking confirmation from flydubai i booked hotels in maldives few days before the flight i received email from flydubai that the time of my flight from dubai to male has changed because of operational reasons and now there is only 15 minutes of stopover in dubai shortly after the whole flight was cancelled and i was given a choice to either switch to another flight for free or get the voucher to use in the future no option to get your money back even if flydubai cancels the flight for their own operational reasons since i already booked and paid for hotels in maldives in time corresponding with my flight that was cancelled i had to choose another flight with the same date of arrival with 11 hours of stopover in dubai few days later i get another email from flydubai informing me that the time of flight has changed again and now i have 125 hours of stopover in dubai luckily it seemed now because the time of departure was changed again it was possible to get back to the flight almost identical to the flight i originally bought i wrote email to flydubai kindly asking to rebook me to my original flight without additional payment describing what happened they denied saying that i already switched to another flight so if i want to change that again i have to pay i wrote again kindly asking to reconsider since the whole situation was caused by flydubai operational reasons they denied again best part of their reply was saying that my email will be forwarded to the management to improve my future experience with flydubai and they will do everything to continue to exceed passengers expectations i asked them to forward my email to the management to improve my present experience the replied that any further correspondence from my side will be treated only as feedback on top of that my flight from dubai to male was delayed so i missed the speedboat from male to the island where i booked the hotel and i had to pay for a night in hotel in male and go to my destination on the next day also even though there were many empty seats is the plane my wife was seated many rows behind me so i had to ask another passenger to switch with me returning flight from dubai to warsaw was also delayed this time i was seated next to my wife but in the last row so we had to put our hand baggage in front of us the only good thing about this whole situation is that i had plenty of time in dubai 125 hours to write this review of my experience with flydubai im giving more than 1 star only because the stewards on board of the plane were nice and the meal served on the plane was decent however it is very unlikely i will ever use flydubai again
1134,air cairo,7,all credit cards were rejected,nice flights all on time with friendly staff for a good price non of the services offered could be purchased in advance seats and meals as all credit cards were rejected also shocked to see use of a kettle on the floor behind row 1 in the galley

3332,airasia philippines,9,i cannot fault this flight,i cannot fault this flight a short hop from manila to boracay its only a 45 minute flight we left on time and arrived early like many budget airlines air asia doesnt offer major luxury or anything but for the price paid for the punctuality the polite cabin crew i was very happy i travelled with my partner in seats 6a and 6b and being at the front we were very comfortable and able to disembark quickly
17775,scoot,1,did not let me remove luggage,did not let me remove luggage took huge amount of money advice pay a little more and choose another airline i booked an extra 30 kg luggage with them my hand bag which on no other flight was weighed was like 2 kgs more and they charged an exorbitant amount and threatened me that they will not let me board if i remove the 2 kgs from my luggage now at that price i could have taken singapore airlines which includes meals and has excellent legroom
21870,virgin australia,6,staff were very friendly and helpful,i had the option of boarding a plane set to depart 1 hour prior to my intended flight which was great unfortunately it was delayed by over 40 minutes staff were very friendly and helpful food was minimal but thats ok given it was a short flight
22777,wizz air,8,toilet should be cleaned better,flawless flight there was a slight delay because runway was busy but we still made it only 25 minutes behind schedule the toilet should be cleaned better during the flight
22626,wamos air,3,seats were spacy enough but old,madrid to cancun with wamos air attendants at the gate were kind and let us choose which seats we wanted in the 3x4x3 configuration of the plane the b747 was 22 years old and you could see it right away the seats were spacy enough but old and my neighbors head support was broken my seat had the inflight entertainment box in the foot space the entertainment was awful 2 movies during a 10h flight on a 6inch old and ugly black and white screen why putting entertainment if it is this poor you could not unlock the controller because it was fixed to the arm rest the service was just ok did not answer call buttons you have to pay alchol beverages and the var was only offered 2 times some of the staff english skills were poor and i think that english for an airline attendant is a must the lunch was average and the extras are a little expensive at least the flight was ontime i expect much more from a tour company that will later bring you to a 5star hotel
8246,easyfly,8,overall a great experience,bogota to pereira after reading many bad reviews were prepared for anything fortunately everything went well our slightly overweight baggage was not an issue 16kg7kg the ground staff was friendly not knowing if they charge extra for not printing the ticket we did the check in ourselves but seeing many with an airline printed ticket i assume this is not an issue the flight left 8 minutes earlier the cabin crew was friendly as well and during the short flight they even offered us a small free drink the plan was clean the captain friendly so overall a great experience not much to complain about really
22006,vistara,6,interested in blame deflection,when things go well with this airline you get a valueformoney and pretty comfortable experience while getting to wherever youre going the hard product is pretty good newish aircraft and good seat options esp on the a321neo and the flight and cabin crew are easily among the best ive flown with so far when things fall apart such as technical issues ground ops at del is unable to plan ahead or communicate effectively despite having the three hours the flight was delayed to start making plans and arrangements while 2 men worked the other 3 men at the del transfer desk were either folding their arms or looking concerned refusing to answer any questions while a dozen or so pax from a severely delayed incoming flight are either rushing for their connection or were simply brushed away without being given the basic accommodation customer care is only interested in blame deflection rather than feedback repeating statements about technical issues and safety when the feedback was not about the technical delay at all
19726,tam airlines,5,tam airlines customer review,gigjfk brand new b767300er quick and pleasant checkin poor lounge on time at departure very efficient and smiling flight attendants more than on emirates for instance excellent choice of wines but poor food full flat bed a bit narrow and hard but adequate on time on arrival
9720,flyarystan,3,treated rudely at check in,almaty to shimkent was treated rudely at check in the first time we flew it was very cheap and this time we flew it was almost the same price as air astana on one flight we had to wait taras to almaty three hours because they lost a passenger and even get off and go back on the plane
3397,airasia x,8,super clean aircraft,love the 232 seat configuration super clean aircraft and friendly efficient service you come to expect from airaisia great prices even with two checked bags to avoid excess baggage fees it is worth it
15293,norwegian,3,unpleasant experience,paris to oakland we arrived paris cdg checkin counter more than 3 hours before our flight despite this we almost didnt make it norwegian had scheduled 3 longhaul flights very close to each other as they dont have online checkin option and there was only one line it took more than half an hour to make it to the checkin kiosk there were 2 attendants milling about to help folks at the kiosks it was not clear if we could walk to the boarding gate right after getting our boarding passes it was also not clear if there was a bag drop counter separate from people having other ticketing issues norwegian didnt post instructions to direct people whatsoever nonetheless we went to counter to see if it was possible for us to sit together on an 11hour flight instead we were interrogated by a sourfaced counter attendant first she wanted to see my companions onward flight out of the us my companion showed her the expedia ticket from her phone the norwegian attendant acted like it was a fake ticket she couldnt locate the flight number from the ticket confirmation so my companion pulled out her laptop to show the same expedia confirmation on a bigger screen the attendant still couldnt locate the flight number accusing her that there wasnt any flight number on the expedia confirmation does this person work for an airline how is it that she cant even find a flight number on ticket confirmation after wrangling between the info on the phone and the laptop for over 10 mins i finally located the onward flight number for her 2 now about the bags i had paid for one 20kg checked bag turned out it was about 2 kg under the limit the norwegian attendant looked over at our backpacks and carryons she proceeded to weigh every bag we were bringing onto the flight there was no mistake that she was trying to find fault we ended up being about 4 kg over between the two of us amongst this excess weight were some apples sandwiches snack bars and bottled water she held on to our passports and tickets and sent us away to figure out how to redistribute all the stuff in our packed bags we ended up eating some of our apples and drinking our water while putting on extra clothes to lighten the combined weight sure thing that norwegian attendant played by the book she didnt do anything wrong but we were scrutinized like we were criminals the unpleasant experience continued at cdg airport though it wasnt norwegians fault there were only two officers at passport control to stamp every outgoing noneu persons passport by the time i arrived at the noneu line it looked like there were people from 6 longhaul flights lined up at some point only one immigrant officer was left stamping passports i was in line for an hour and a half having already wasted almost an hour and a half at the norwegian checkin counter i made it to the gate only just in time even though we got there more than 3 hours before flight departure the only points i am giving to this review had to do with the uneventful onflight experience it wasnt unpleasant and that says a lot to compensate for a very weak checkin experience in cdg
8866,ethiopian airlines,2,if i missed my flight its not their fault,on our way from addis ababa en route to toronto aircraft broke down at dublin at 500am and was grounded pilot announced aircraft had a hydraulic pump failure and could not fly same day since they needed spares so we were taken into the lounge room at dublin we were kept in lounge room for 11 hours without anything to eat not even a cookie there was no ethiopian airlines staff present i tried to go into the main airport area but i was stopped by airport security we were not allowed to leave the lounge room so we just kept there from 500am till 500pm when we were told there was another aircraft which came to take us i had a connecting flight which was to depart at 150 pm but we arrived 700pm so i had missed the flight on the last aircraft i asked the crew to avail me with internet and me willing to pay so i can email west jet and let them know i wont be able to make it for my flight and the crew lady told me its for paying and i said i am paying then she said that i dont need to worry because many people are going to miss their flight so we are communicating with our head office so when you get to toronto just go to our desk and they will book you your connecting flight when i got to toronto the staff told me if i missed my flight its not their fault and i had to spend the night on a bench next to ethiopian airlines desk at toronto airport then i found my own way to get home and there after raised my complaint to ethiopian airlines
20977,tui airways,5,dull as dishwater b757,larnaca to manchester i recently enjoyed a holiday with my family group of 7 consisting of 4 adults and 3 children the first point is with regard to the online checkin service on the outward flight my wife and i have always checked in via the normal procedure at the check in desk my daughter preferred the online method to my mind our use of the unfamiliar touch screen procedure seemed no quicker than letting an experienced checkin desk assistant carry out the task one of my daughters cases was found to be 25kg over the modest 15kg allowance there is every chance that a person may waive this minor indiscretion but the online system is totally abitrary culminating in a 45 surcharge this was later waived by a tui assistant to be fair moving onto the flight itself there were no issues of note other than being on a dull as dishwater boeing 757 very basic the week long holiday at tofinis hotel near ayia napa was great enjoyed the food etc no probs on the return flight we found it to be delayed just prior to the return transfer 2 hours on a late night flight but no major issues these things happen however it was common knowledge amongst the passengers due to internet checks but on arrival the tui rep chose not to mention it i sort of understand that because why would anyone make themselves the focal point of peoples frustration if you dont have to onto the flight and again we found ourselves on the rather tired looking 757 i suspect tui are suffering due to the grounding of the 737 max of which they were the biggest customers and i understand the companys predicament the flight was adequate and on landing at manchester we found the airport was disorganised due in part to procedural disruption arising from the ongoing terminal expansion we were held on the plane and kept informed over the tannoy by a clearly irritated member of the cabin crew who informed us that we needed to be bused from the tarmac to terminal and the airport hadnt been expecting us half an hour later we were disembarking and the journey was complete the following day i felt as rough as sandpaper cold symptoms and a sore throat i cannot conclusivly put this down to the plane journey but it is known that changes in air pressure can cause physiological effects like toothache and joint pain having taken trips on the uber modern tui dreamliners with their humidified cabin air i had forgotten just how rough an old plane could leave you feeling i hope for tuis sake that their fleet problems can be resolved sooner rather than later
18872,spicejet,1,i havent come across a worse service,i havent come across a worse service than the one offered by spicejet on 5th november 2022 i was travelling from delhi to udaipur on 5th nov for a vacation not only was the flight cancelled without informing us wasting hours at the airport booking new flight basis availability but they did not even have the decency to refund the amount that was spent booking the flights i am sick and tired of calling spicejet customer care but no one picks the calls i know many customers here are thinking that this might be a 1 of incident but trust me i have faced multiple issues with spicejet in the past and if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone reading this as well save yourself some trouble and book another airline for your own sake cant expect anything from from the airlines after this pathetic service
9323,fiji airways,3,operated by miami air,brisbane to nadi with fiji airways hidden fees expensive cartoons for entertainment and operated by miami air this was booked as a qantas flight however this is simply a codeshare so dont expect any decent standards of service when i arrived at the airport i had to pay extra for a surfboard qantas allow surfboards for free then got on an old plane for this 35 hr flight operated by miami air which had one screen every ten rows on which they played a video of tom and jerry they served terrible meals this was not a budget flight nor was it advertised as a budget airline it was advertised as a qantas flight so with the additional surfboard charges it cost 800 for a 35 hour flight
19993,thai airasia,1,very friendly and helpful,this was my second thai airasia flight this year flying from hong kong to chiang mai the prior one being from cnx to hkt in january i paid extra for the hot seats and had seats in row 1 each time these seats have plenty of legroom and werent that much more money i also prepurchased meals on a couple of the flights and prepaid for checked baggage on my flight in january i found the fas on all flights to very friendly and helpful as were the ground staff the hot seats get you priority boarding which is good if you have carry on the prices for drinks on board are also very reasonable i paid 3 for a singha beer which is a bargain considering us airlines will charge 7 for a beer all in all i had good experiences on all my flights with them and would not hesitate to use them again
14661,meridiana,6,recommend using this airline,this is a basic no frills airline we flew from naples to nyc in early sept 2016 economy the flight was delayed by about 2 hours partly due to weather the previous day and partly due to a very poor boarding procedure at the naples airport likely not meridianas fault the plane was pretty old with no charging stations or any entertainment system the service was very good the staff spoke english and were professional and mostly nice the food was average the seats were of average comfort legroom and cleanliness blankets and pillows were provided free of charge the flight was uneventful it cost around 300 one way and i think thats a very good bang for the buck if you dont care about bells and whistles like entertainment system id recommend using this airline to fly into andor out of italy
3677,airlink,9,crew friendly and efficient,airlink is an up and coming airline in southern africa that has been expanding surprisingly its service is very good and quite friendly my flight was a sunday evening flight and a relatively short one of about 1 hour and 10 minutes those of us in business class were called to board first boarding was accomplished by a walk across the tarmac to the plane as it appears the jetways at maputo airport are not operable passengers were seated quickly on this mostly full flight and take off was prompt what was pleasantly surprising is that en route we were served with a good light dinner that solved my issue with where to eat after arrival the seat was comfortable and i was seated in a window seat on the left side of the aisle restrooms were clean and appropriately stocked service by cabin staff was efficient and friendly and we arrived in johannesburg about 15 minutes after the meal service i am quite happy with the service of airlink as this is the 4th time i have flown with them their aircraft are nicely maintained the crew is friendly and efficient and they are increasingly spreading their wings through southern africa i am comfortable in recommending airlink
18803,southwest airlines,2,sw was very blatant and careless,i was at the clev boarding gates and the gentlemen said my purchased 2nd seat wasnt printed properly and kept my boarding pass but he would bring it to me once corrected got on a the plane nothing to hold my 2nd seat and couldnt get the attention of the flighty stewardess at the front to advise once the plane was completely full the guy from boarding gates came and loudly announced to the couple next to me that one of them had to move to another flight due to that seat already being purchased after they questioned him since they were there and seating is fcfs he loudly announced in front of entire plane its because of her size its a safety issue the entire plane laughed and talked about me the entire flight saying i should have been made to get off i cried the entire flight home of embarrassment since my weight is due to a medical condition sw promised me a luv voucher for my inconvenience which was routed to the wrong email not one on my complaint and then refused to deal with me any further i am advising please avoid sw if you are of size when i flew american in the past they were much more understanding and private in their interactions about my second seat purchase sw ruined my self esteem and created any future flying with a traumatic experience worrying the same will happen again sw was very blatant and careless about discriminating against someone of size
21540,utair aviation,8,utair aviation customer review,flew last week from munich to tyunmen tjm siberia b735 with europeanstyle business cabin middle seat free smooth checkin my coat was taken by a smiling attendant but no help to put my 8kg luggage in the locker no entertainment during the 5 12 hours journey redeye but more than decent meal with appetisers and good chilean wine i hope that my return flight in two days will be at least as peaceful although the linguistic capacities of the crew should be improved
17676,saudi arabian airlines,1,never travel with them,amman to mumbai via jeddah worst airline with no support never travel with them they are the worst no ground support and no instructions food was also really bad
14571,malindo air,5,did not apologise for the inconvenience,the flight was ok ran on time and was reasonably comfortable we had purchased extra leg room on the flight to bali they did not give us the meals we had ordered and paid for with our tickets and argued until i pointed my name on the list that was not ticked but this took persistent nagging of staff who did not care at all they did not apologise for the inconvenience just eye rolled on the way home we had gone through customs with empty water bottles and then filled them up at the airport water station then by the boarding gate they were taking away water from everybody we were pretty happy to tip our water out on the plane we asked for a cup of water and were told we had to pay i understand paying for any other snack or beverage but a cup of water after theyve confiscated everyones water thats just disgusting we got a good price for tickets but would think again before flying with them again
20962,tui airways,4,planes are quite basic and uncomfortable,both our outgoing flight and returning flights departed late the outgoing flight was an hour late although we were all on the plane on time the return flight departed 45 minutes late as only one staff member was working the gate this was very frustrating as we have flown with tui on a number of occasions which we have experienced delays tui planes are quite basic and uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight and the food and drinks onboard are expensive staff onboard the plane are friendly
14633,martinair,4,martinair customer review,my husband and i travelled with our two granddaughters from newcastle to orlando via amsterdam klm newcastle to amsterdam and then martinair from amsterdam to orlando we upgraded to comfort class and had very pleasant flights on time the crew on all flights were very nice and helpful their prices are very competitive and again we found no fault whatsoever
21472,us airways,2,us airways customer review,25 for each checked bag is definitely a negative in my book the flight itself should include your luggage fee the way this airline does seating is entirely asinine you can book your flight at any time but you have to wait until within two weeks of the flight to actually pick your seats the flight was very loud and the lights and air conditioners at each seat were difficult to adjust at some points feeling as if they would break if you tried to point the air toward you snacks all have to be paid for rather than being included which also seems ridiculous when the flight already costs so much i probably will never voluntarily fly with us airways or american airlines for that natter in the future other airlines have free bag checks and plenty of snacks on board at no extra cost
2438,air namibia,6,air namibia customer review,windhoekcape town return in may the flying product of air namibia is very good indeed new airbus a319 with good seat comfort cheerful cabin crew and ok food inflight entertainment on the boring side but no problem for such a short flight i did like it what lets them down is the awful administration it takes ages to reach someone by phone and their so called call centre puts you on a loop whenever you are calling so for me it was thumbs up for the flight and thumbs down for the admin
17401,s7 siberia airlines,5,s7 siberia airlines customer review,beijing to irkutsk and from to moscow apart from problems with visas the airport service was good service on the plane was appalling for almost 7 hours on the plane we didnt notice single smile on staff faces rude and not very helpful like they work there as a punishment portions of food was ridiculous and boxes like happy meal at mcdonalds we had also a lots of problems to book tickets on internet being in irkutsk at the airport system didnt accept our cards even if we tried like 6 of different kind they lost my luggage in beijing but luckily was sent to london a week later
8467,egyptair,1,offered a nonvegetarian meal,on flight from cairo to mumbai we were offered beef in our meal despite we opted vegetarian meal option on top of all the behavior of crew members was extremely rude and arrogant it was complete chaos before we were served the meal we were observing that the hostess was not serving passengers as per their preferred meal selection rather she was simply asking for the meal passenger of the passengers a vegetarian meal or a nonvegetarian meal whereas people like us who dont eat any nonvegetarian food were offered a nonvegetarian meal
9102,eurowings,2,charged us each 50 eur for our small carry ons,the flight from venice to stuttgart was delayed because of a general italian strike eurowings postponed the flight for a couple of hours and we missed our connecting flight to hamburg we arrived to stuttgart the ticket booking desk helped us with the rebooking to the flight we wanted to catch the next day and we were told to go to the hotel and then charge back the costs to the airline up to here all good the airline did everything as they should the problem started in stuttgart airport at the eurowings boarding gate for our flight to hamburg we booked basic and payed additionally to drop each our luggage we only had a small carry on we travelled light and we checked if we can dropped what we payed for at the boarding gate and the answer was yes especially happy due to the problems that are currently happening with the luggage we done so in venice so why wouldnt this be allowed in stuttgart the lady working at the eurowings boarding gate in stuttgart decided differently and charged us each 50 eur for our small carry ons so we can drop them next to the plane we thought it was because the plane was busy or full no the plan was half empty and there was a lot of space for more carryon luggages i havent experienced a more dishonest and literally dedicated to customer unsatification employees as these lady at these gate for a very long time i would not recommend to use eurowings when flying via stuttgart and if possible to use dusseldorf as connecting airport

9081,eurowings,6,for the price it was ok,for the price it was ok the cabin crews are friendly they answered questions about buying snacks in a friendly manner the chairs were rather uncomfortable for longer distances since they were a bit tight on the shorthaul flight to palma de mallorca the food tasted great and bridged the flight time very well unfortunately very expensive 2x coffee and 2x rolls with chicken came 15 eur as a lowbudget airline we naturally didnt have any inflight entertainment such as a tablet or customer kits if youre looking to save money you can fly with eurowings but only for shorthaul flights

3424,airasia x,3,children under 5 in sleeper cabin,children under 5 in a sleeper cabin fortunately the mother was very attentive to her childrens needs however the half dozen times they did get upset and cry was enough to wake us each time rendering the choice of a sleeper cabin redundant and had we been informed of this we would have chosen a hot seat saving 600 each also attitude of attendants was the worst we have experienced
7410,condor airlines,2,customer service was pathetically bad,everything written above about condor is true the plane was old the food service was so small that it was mostly laughable the customer service over the phone was pathetically bad checkin was not successful online there was a risk that it should have been done during the 2hour changeover at the frankfurt airport never again and it wasnt even cheap for the same price you can get decent things from air france or lufthansa

12725,karthago airlines,1,karthago airlines customer review,we have just travelled back from tunisia after a 7 hour delay flying from gatwick with no explanation only to be met when we boarded with a grumpy crew with no interest in the passengers and a plane that was borderline on the unsafe broken seats tables and a tatty cabin on the way back there were four karthago flights the first was delayed for 14hrs a manchester flight delayed for 95hrs ours for 7hrs and another one indefinitely again with no explanation other than a technical fault so as per the comment below two technical faults in a week not reassuring the plane coming back was worse
16647,ravn alaska,6,ravn alaska customer review,ancfaianc economy open seating check in was difficult the checkin agent did not understand how to read my ticket and almost seemed to blame me for the error once on board however the flight attendants both on the outbound and return were very nice especially on the return flight a definite sense of humor era offers low fares between anchorage and fairbanks and i will be flying with them again its also nice not to have to go to security when flying on the smaller planes
17871,shanghai airlines,1,shanghai airlines customer review,the plane had a foul odor throughout the flight the plane sat on the tarmac for nearly an hour before going anywhere the food was hardly edible though not necessary for the short 2 hour flight lukewarm beer was served free of charge the plane itself was old and in need of retirement the seats were about as cramped together as any i have seen

17026,royal brunei airlines,7,incredibly low price,melbourne to london via bandar seri begawan and dubai with royal brunei airlines overall a very good experience for an incredibly low price outbound at checkin we were offered emergency exit seats for all three legs at no charge a major bonus for me being over six foot staff were attentive and reasonably friendly seats comfortable meals ok and the boeing 787 really is a up there in the running as the most comfortable longhaul aircraft ife modern but only soso in terms of choices music options were particularly obscure minor complaints were the two stops dubai and brunei dragging things out especially the brunei stopover where food drink and shopping options remain limited staff did very few water or soft drink runs when the cabin lights were out also the three seven hour flights make food servings slightly difficult one meal or two sometimes it was only one meal which was a stretch hungry sometimes one plus a quite tasty and satisfactory hot wrap but mostly one plus a serving of either sweet or savoury biscuits which was enough to tide one over but rather odd

11256,iberia express,6,doesnt offer a little snack,madrid to tenerife i was booked on this flight as connecting from venice and this was operated by iberia express i went to the counter as i wanted to change seat if possible as my friends had another seat assigned when i went to the counter there were two people sitting there one lady which was the first one i went to which asked me to wait as she was on her phone i was upset so i just went to the other hostess which was very kind and bit sarcastic and he helped me out with the tickets once at the gate my friends which were coming from another connecting flight had a big delay which was almost overlapping with our next flight to tenerife i was afraid that they would have missed their flight when i talked to the hostess she was looking like she was not caring when they started to understand what the issue was they tried to make sure that they could make it as it was just a little overlapping delay than luckily we made it to the flight and before taking off the flight attendant came to all the passengers to offer some water iberia doesnt offer a little snack which i could almost understand on a 45 minutes flight but that flight was 225h long the flight was basically a night flight so everything went smooth until we reached the destination

8359,edelweiss air,1,customer service is nonexisting,how do you evaluate a mediumhaul flight in economy overall they are pretty much all the same until something goes wrong and thats when you can really have a feeling of the level of the airline long queue for checkin in la palma could be improved but not too bad 45 minutes delay at departure due to strong headwind from coming flight nice way of saying we wanted to save some fuel but the captain was confident that with tailwind we will arrive on time too bad he missed his first attempt of landing and didnt have time to land before airport closure at 11pm we landed 40 minutes later 250km away from what was supposed to be our final destination fa didnt say much and kept saying that we will know more once on ground that was a lie 0 out of 10 in terms of taking responsibilities at baggage claim there is no personnel from the airline just a poor staff from the airport trying to do whatever she can and the message was clear youre on your own its 1am youre 250km away from where you were supposed to land and there wont be any help from the airline to get you to your final destination meanwhile we finally get an email from the airline we ask you to make your own arrangements for a hotel and transportation to your final destination followed by a couple of restrictions on budget what a joke customer service is nonexisting this airline is a shame for star alliance its going to be a while before you see me again on a swiss flight

5560,belavia,8,belavia customer review,i have flown several times with belavia from moscow and london to minsk and have been impressed on every occasion they might not be cheap from london to minsk but they are very competitive from moscow to minsk even better if you fly on their brand new embraer aircraft which are going to replace the aged boeing 737s the staff are very courteous and efficient on every flight sweets are given before takeoff and usually before landing food isnt fantastic but neither is easyjets or bas i have flown with western european airlines into minsk and the prices are sometimes cheaper if there is a sale on otherwise belavia offers good value for money vs time and hassle avoided from london gatwick from moscow dme belavia codeshare with s7 so you will always fly belavia from dme to msq
8413,edelweiss air,1,edelweiss air customer review,reservations is difficult to reach if calling from usa primarily because of their operating hours and time difference i called multiple times and waited at one point for 40min for an agent finally an agent answered the line only to advise me the office was now closed and to please call tomorrow the reason for my repeated call was seat assignments i dont mind and expected to pay for advanced seat selection how ever neither the website nor the call center was helpful the website finally received the required update and we confirm our seat selection the flight crew was friendly competent and helpful food was typical seat room and pitch terrible when we arrived our bags didnt absolutely terrible customer service we are unable to reach anyone and have yet to hear from edelweiss i am not impressed with some of edelweiss customer service
21292,turkmenistan airlines,2,turkmenistan airlines customer review,i have flown several times with ta but rarely enjoyed the trip made worse by the lack of everything one associates with a decent air carrier they dont have staff who can speak english no particular manners and in general they are rude no information in english or hindipunjabi on board or at ashgabad how one should know what to do or expect in term of time for board i think they treat passengers with contempt and anger directed towards them i have witnessed the so call air hostesses being rude as for the onboard entertainment the less said the better they make all announcements in some language that not a single passenger understands i know they sometimes have one air hostess who pretends to speak english but no one can understand as it simply isnt english the occasional films they show are in russian and always highly embarassing for indians overall i would rate ta 2 out of 10 you may say why 2 when the whole service is so diabolical well they usually let you sit down in a sort of seat and if you dont ask for anything they dont hit you over the head and also because usually flights are on time would you fly with this thing well as for me and all my friends and family i much rather take a maruti from birmingham to amritsar if i had the time than subjecting myself again to this humiliation frustration insults and torture lasting almost 12 hrs
15687,openskies,5,openskies customer review,oryewr return lounge at ory is pretty minimal with everyone crowded at one end to avoid the noise of the building work going on at the other end the plane struck me as having seen better days the fittings are a bit scuffed around the edges and several people including me had seats that either didnt recline or wouldnt stay upright luckily there were few people on the outbound flight and there were a multitude of alternative seats to choose from ife is terrible handheld devices that keep crashing requiring the user to restart whatever theyre watching and presenting all sorts of logistical problems when the tray youve just set it up on is required for the meal take a laptop or similar to entertain yourself lounge in ewr is poor wrong side of security and looks like a large waiting room i jumped ship and headed for the ba terraces lounge past security and right beside the openskies departure gate overnight return flight was more populated but the almost lieflat beds provided a good nights kip overall a nice sense of space and the fas are attentive generous with their time and drinks and even though theres a biz beds and biz seats segregation going on you still feel as if youre enjoying something a little unknown and exclusive personally i wouldnt make the effort of travelling to paris just to fly openskies again not without checking the difference between this and premium economy on ba first but if youre there already its worth a look

12571,jetstar pacific,1,sadly always encounter the worst staff,this is our second flight with jetstar pacific and sadly always encounter the worst staff they try to squeeze the most money out of you checking every bag in the cabin and trying to charge you more to put it as checked luggage this is the only airline ive seen with this policy and the rudeness of the staff is unacceptable we paid for 25kg and had 26kg for whichever they were trying to charge also it is clear that the strategy of the company is to overcharge as much as possible and squeeze every penny just simply avoid it since the rates that you see are not true due to all the extra charges they force you to pay
12430,jetstar asia,7,an uneventful short hop,jakarta to singapore with jetstar asia flight left somewhat late other than that it was an uneventful short hop seats rather stiff and unconfortable staff seemingly somewhat stressed out or tired but they took us there at a low cost
18286,singapore airlines,7,crew really are the highlight,overall an ok flight lounge silverkris changi is huge and was too over crowded we had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable we only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes way too busy gateboarding we got in line was told there was no point as it hadnt opened we stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority seat narrow overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing others had to help no other storage except under the foot rest there is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones menu and water bottle were kept not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room hard being a side sleeper food as all my other flights had poor quality food i opted for no meal just sleep the passenger in front argued with the fa over no breakfast service personally i believe there should have been a choice but no the lovely fa verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when i woke which was lovely of her as i woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised on arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line overall the crew really are the highlight with singapore airlines the rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident also disappointed that when i booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350900 medium haul
5393,bangkok airways,4,time to refresh bangkok airways,my previous flights with bangkok airways have been good however this trip was not up to the boutique standard while the service onboard was efficient a couple of the female flight attendants appeared to be less than happy and did not seem to be able smile sure we all have bad days but when your job is in the service industry then act pleasant i also thought that the aircraft appeared to look a little tired time to refresh bangkok airways
10560,goair,1,treat their passengers like fools,i arrived early for my scheduled flight kochi to srinagar via mumbai it was scheduled at 1030am but i landed at mumbai 1030 due to that i couldnt board my flight the airline clearly knows the landing time and im going to miss my connection flight but i have not received any single call regarding this even your staff could have inform me during checking i visited the help desk for the issue they said no more flights for today and tomorrows flights also cancelled next day i booked indigo flight to the destination from my pocket go air is worst airline they treat their passengers like fools
6452,caribbean airlines,3,no entertainment system at all,we flew caribbean airlines from new york jfk to port of spain and back both flights were delayed by about 15 hrs without good reasons jfkpos had no entertainment system at all return flight had some but a lot of control units didnt work at all or sound was awful six of us were flying plus i tried some other available seats so i can say with certainty that a lot of units were defective food was very mediocre but acceptable so were the crews bottom line if it is much cheaper than competition then it is worth it otherwise stay away
2449,air namibia,5,air namibia customer review,service on board is not so bad but everyday you must fight with cancellations delays and unbelievable situations sometimes i fly domestically and generally they are not so bad but awful when i flew long haul wdhfra in fra after we checked baggage they announced the flight to wdh was delayed until the next day it was no possible to get your luggage back sw paid hotel and dinner in a good hotel but airline service was very bad
21907,virgin australia,9,my preference of airline,virgin australia is my preference of airline when travelling domestically throughout australia i have always been a qantas user however since covid i just cant justify the huge premium they charge especially as a frequent flyer the staff at virgin are amongst the best the new melbourne lounge is amazing they have a good selection of food and alcohol i just wish they offered spirits in their lounges but this is offered onboard virgin has a much trendieryouthful approach which i appreciate the business class product is on par with qantas great food and drink i find the seat plush and spacious the seat doesnt offer an ife screen but this is no issue as i travel between melsyd which is an hour flight they will give business class passengers an ipad or you can stream off your own device
4409,ana all nippon airways,6,found the leg room was excellent,tokyo to perth we found the leg room was excellent even though take off was delayed by 30 minutes on the ground at tokyo due to earlier fog at narita the pilot managed to make up time during the 95 hour flight and arrive on time in perth we felt the food provided was not as good as it could have been the first meal is served within 2 hours of taking off it was a passable chicken dish with side dishes of yoghurt salad and ice cream the second meal is a snack and is served within 2 hours of landing out of australia the snack was fine something like a ham and cheese croissant but out of tokyo the snack was an open sandwich with an inexplicable ton of mayonnaise plus vegetables corn i found it horrible the entertainment options had some recent hollywood movies to choose from not much choice apart from that the tv shows and documentaries were poor or non existent ana needs to up their game in ife the ife user interface was difficult for me to use and the cabin announcements were far too quiet i could not hear 90 of what the captain and crew announced during the flight i probably will not fly ana again
15420,olympic air,8,olympic air customer review,athensvienna return on a319 cabin interior lavatories clean seat pitch quite comfortable candies and newspapers offered after boarding hot meal served and plenty of cold and hot beverages cabin crew polite and professional inflight magazine was average there was no videomusic entertainment available
2319,air mauritius,7,air mauritius customer review,lhrmur return as experienced business travellers there are certain things we expect we were originally flying ba until they changed the schedule meaning a loss of a days holiday unacceptable when you only have 7 so we changed to air mauritius which to be frank i was dreading check in fast and efficient fast track through customs as you would expect as a small airline the lounge is shared with other airlines a real let down next to no food choice wine etc ok emirates it wasnt once on the plane business seemed reasonably comfortable until you try to sleep the seat doesnt lie flat but sloping to the floor im 5ft 9 and my feet were rammed into the seat in front i didnt sleep a wink all night having said that food reasonable wine flowed nicely we couldnt get our tv to work my husband slept most of the way i had a very long night return ok lounge very nice food less appealing on the flight home very weird combinations we had 2 full dinners and afternoon tea halfway through got the tv to work this time but film selection rubbish
2405,air namibia,6,happy with the overall experience,windhoek to frankfurt after having read reviews i was prepared for bad service and problems during the flight but luckily everything was fine and i am quite happy with the overall experience the aircraft is spacious and clean seats are comfortable and have a pillow and a blanket for each passenger the crew was 50 very friendly and 50 not so good cop bad cop the food was quite good however it might have been better maybe a dessert could be added big selection of drinks but only one type of juice orange on the long overnight flight dinner and breakfast have been offered during the flight the crew also offered water the entertainment system is still not working it seems to be a persistent problem that the airline is not willing to solve
10987,hi fly,8,hi fly customer review,this flight was a replacement for a tap flight that was cancelled the previous day the aircraft was an and there was no inflight entertainment what so ever the crew was young and pleasant we enjoyed the experience

6212,brussels airlines,7,brussels airlines customer review,warsaw to brussels i had a great experience with brussels airlines legroom and seats very comfortable there was one disadvantageno snack you had to purchase it but they were good quality i would recommend their service
16741,regional express,5,regional express customer review,sydney to orange return first experience with rex compared to some of the larger domestic and international carriers rex provided excellent service and warm friendly crew on both legs although only a 45 minute flight each way we were still provided with a snack and hot beverage baggage collection at sydney was outstandingly quick wed fly them again the checked baggage limit of 15 kg per person could provide a challenge for some people
5111,azerbaijan airlines,9,service was impressive,i flew azerbaijan airlines from new york to tel aviv via baku check in was a bit slow but friendly staff plane was full and it was my first time flying a dreamliner the cabin crew although they never smiled were great and the service was impressive the plane was comfortable with plenty of legroom and big windows we were given an amenity kit which was a great little extra before our first hot meal was served we were given heated serviettes to freshen up with a choice of chicken or beef was offered served with a salad cake and a starter it was lovely and fresh drinks of course and their wine was really nice then we were given a snack inflight entertainment was ok good choice but older movies mostly the screen was a good size touch screen larger than average with a charger for your phone leg room was good and i found the seat comfortable with a pillow and blanket duty free came round and was very cheap so good to note on that route half the price of offers in jfk airport it was a 105 hour flight and a couple of hours later we got a sandwich and snacks again after a few more hours we were served another hot meal i had omelette and roast potatoes and veg it was well presented with again rolls etc and drinks smooth flight and 3d tracking of route which was interactive which kept you well updated fantastic landing in baku smaller connecting flight to tel aviv with very much the same great service and none of cabin crew minded how much you pressed for service on both flights
13036,korean air,7,absence of footrest in economy,manila to new york via seoulincheon the aircraft was in excellent condition the cabin was clean and smelling good and seats had ample leg room ife was okay but has limited selection food was above average but could taste better cabin crew are kind and warm but couldve been more attentive to needs as there was a point they stop delivering drinks you know how it gets too dry in the throat during longhaul flights my biggest concern with my flight was the absence of footrest in economy seats and perhaps the biggest factor why ill rather fly asiana in my next trip
8072,dragonair,6,almost like a nofrills airline,kolkata to hong kong with dragonair the flight was almost like a nofrills airline did not expect this from cathay pacific no personal screens on seats no drinks options just a snack box the seats were ok though lot of turbulence especially just before landing at hong kong a big bump no seat chargers cathay pacific needs to improve its dragonair flight services on international routes
9269,fastjet,3,and still no refund,dar es salaam to lusaka via harare fastjet cancelled flight and put me on one 2 days later without my consent notified me via sms i called in 7 times sent 2 emails and drove to their branch at airport to get a refund in process finally received email confirming refund would take 5 to 7 days been 2 weeks and still no refund

15903,peruvian airlines,1,caused me so many problems,pucallpa to lima this has been my worst experience with an airline i was traveling from pucallpa on 24th july 2018 to lima the flight should have been at 1610 and i was at the airport more than two hours before the flight when i arrived together with my friends my flight was not listed on the departure screens and when finally the peruvian staff got available i was informed that there was a delay 5 hours however i was checked in and knew i would not make my connection flight from lima back to europe at 8pm i was forced to buy a new ticket which cost me 700 usd not only that the new flight got me too late for my work and i lost a customer because of this at the airport the staff did not know any information about the flight nor the plane nor even when there would be the departure instead we kept being promised lied that the flight will depart another hour later and later on again and again in the end the flight departed only at 2345 this caused me so many problems with no compensation whatsoever no apology no support at the airport no interest in the customer this was for the last time i used services of this airline
10341,germania airline,6,no agreement with eurowings,sharm el sheikh to dusseldorf when i got to the airport i found out that my flight was delayed by 50 minutes i had asked the ground staff to please check my luggage through to hamburg as i had a connecting flight with eurowings from dusseldorf the agent informed me that he could easily check me through but he would need the permission from germania he wrote an email to them and so i had to wait about 45 minutes until he had shown me their response the response stated that they had no agreement with eurowings and that i would need to pick up my luggage and check it in with them again as the flight was already delayed by 50 minutes i would miss my connecting flight in dusseldorf to hamburg when i had arrived in dusseldorf i had found out that my luggage was not carried on my flight lucky me my connecting flight was cancelled theoretically the ground service does not even deserve a one star rating the crew on the other side was very friendly and provided great service seat on the aircraft was very comfortable and i had enough space for my legs as well
3877,alaska airlines,4,alaska changes your seat without telling you,alaska changes your seat without telling you switches you from an aisle seat to a non aisle seat over 300lbs here without notice and without any chance to fix it when asked they said yeah it happens and shrugged it just happened to me back to back on 2 legs of my flight to san francisco they dont even apologize during checkin their seat map is mysteriously not available so you cant verify your seats i have no idea why they do that i probably wouldnt care if they had respected my aisle seating but they couldnt even do that the 3 persons i talked to were patronizing unapologetic and tried to insinuate it was on me and then told me that there never was any guarantee about the seat you book what never seen that on any other airline
14126,lufthansa,2,staff unfriendly and abrupt,awful overall from start plane loaded illogically from front to back so last on battling through others food awful and special diet food forgotten about until asked for response given not apologetic but annoyed touchscreens nonresponsive seat recline very difficult and earpiece plug not functioning in 1 ear plug staff unfriendly and abrupt leg room shrunk in last years too
3570,airbaltic,2,a 3 hour flight was terrible,riga to tbilisi my first flight with airbatic went smoothly but that was only 35mins but a 3 hour flight was terrible the plane was the hottest plane i have ever flown on to the point it was making me feel physically sick the cabin is a 23 layout but the air con for the aisle seat on the three is non existent i felt the seat were also uncomfy true design of the seats is truly awful
908,air astana,9,very good representatives for the airline,a small gift provided on boarding the aircraft was a pleasant addition to the warm welcome for all the women travelling on iwd a gesture which set the tone for a very pleasant return trip from heathrow to pavlodar each and everyone of the flight staff were friendly and helpful and very good representatives for the airline there was more than ample space i could stretch out on three seats and actually managed to sleep the inflight entertainment was great and the safety notice really slick so i actually watched it in three languages the catering and hospitality was super and i will look forward to flying with them once more
25,adria airways,5,value for money is not there nor the experience,fly only if no other connection i am a frequent business flyer mostly departing from vienna or munich to destinations the flight with adria was chosen due to convenience however if i had an option to choose next time the value for money is not there nor the experience outdated aircraft buzzing from ac in the upper compartment present the whole time of descending and extremly anoying complimentary glass of water and snack pretzles other options only upon payment does not seem acceptable fot the price over 400 eur not to mention online check in unavailable from paris while the traffic to the airport is unpredictable hence online check in is a must all in all i would fly adria again only if there is no other option left the aircraft staff though very nice
1452,air china,6,not worth the delays,san francisco to mumbai via beijing with air china business class was good for the price you pay but not worth the delays the food was good lots of sea food and steak very limited options for vegetarians though my connecting flight to mumbai was delayed by over 5 hours at beijing we spent hours circling around in the airport runways taxing then circling around again so a 6 hour flight to mumbai turned to 11 hours really frustrating the airline staff didnt give any proper updates for the delays the delays seem to be common at airports in china no wifi in plane changed my return flight to american airlines via hong kong
2678,air nostrum,4,air nostrum customer review,madvlcmad in economy madvlc on air nostrum and vlcmad on iberia maybe i was lucky but the experience was quite good the flights both ways were on time and without any unpleasant incident connecting from air canada terminal 1 in madrid to iberia terminal 4 was a bit of a trial it took a good 15 minutes on the shuttle bus much of it on the highway air nostrum used a bombardier crj a bit tight for space service on this 50 minute flight exceeded my expectations no inflight entertainment none was expected of course given the small plane and short flight the two fa managed to serve drinks and miniature sandwiches an almost microscopic bun with a single slice of chorizo inside although they had to rush to get it done i was in the last row and the descent to valencia airport was choppy felt like a life raft in rough sea anyway service was pleasant and i give air nostrum full marks on my return leg on an iberia airbus 320 the experience was also quite good although below air nostrum fas did their job and were reasonably pleasant clean plane with 33 configuration leather seats with lots of leg room the flight was only half full and left about 15 minutes late but got to madrid on time the downside was absolutely no drinks or snacks of any kind except in business class there was food for purchase but i didnt see a single person purchasing no ife or video demonstration of any kind i had only carryon so cant comment on baggage handling overall a good experience i would give air nostrum 4 star and iberia 3 star
16817,rossiya airlines,6,no consistent business class product,denpasar to moscow hard product ok as the aircraft has been flying for emirates before with angled seats providing acceptable comfort huge screen but only showing airshow ife works on your personal device through a dedicated app selection of movies rather limited streaming with some issues during the flight catering on level of premium economy some choices but very basic food wine available one white and one red basic quality no snacks between the two meals on a 13 hour flight nuts only crew trying to do their best very friendly overall no consistent business class product huge room for improvement value for money below average
15185,norse atlantic airways,3,comfort aboard is awful,greedy company 160 extra for 5 kilo exceeding weight this is unbelievable the ticket itself is not that cheaper from other company i tried and it will be first and last moreover the comfort aboard is awful luckily onboard crew is nice
7244,cityjet,7,cityjet customer review,flew from lcy to dundee walked through security and the flight was delayed 40 mins due to a storm in scotland boarded quickly on yo the dornier 328 which is a delight to fly 21 seating with 31 seat pitch 2 drink runs with food offered i ended up having 2 half roast beef sandwiches 3 small bottles of white wine and some a packet of nuts very pleasant member of cabin crew
16594,qatar airways,6,inflight experience was mostly good,i traveled with my family from nagoya to dublin via tokyo narita and doha our experience was average overall we flew on 7878s 777300er and a3501000 seats were good quality and design but narrow on the 777 especially 10 seats across even though the legroom was good the newest of their aircraft was the best to fly on the a350 with a roomy and airy feeling with high ceiling the inflight experience was mostly good but they could be more generous with drinks and snacks between meals children dont always eat at the designated times during the flight the worst part of our experience was the structure of the ground service and connections we had to recheck our bags in tokyo for the domestic flights security checks intransit in doha buses for the dublin flight in doha and qr dont issue boarding passes for the jal domestic connection overall i might fly on this airline again but i dont see anything specific that stands out and would convince me to always choose them over a european airline in the future
13000,korean air,4,its so hard to book with them,seoul to bangkok generally staff at korean air are good food is pretty tasty and the onboard entertainment is varied but unfortunately gets interrupted all the time in 3 different languages strangely for a technologically advanced nation they fall down on their website and general technology their website in korea accepts korean or international cards if youre an expatriate your korean card wont work and if you use an international card youre likely to be singled out for fraud because quite rightly the credit card company wont share information with a vendor the process to overcome this is to type your entire credit card number into their system to unlock your booking the option not to do this is unavailable and no mention is made of what happens to this very private data once its been entered into their system additionally the company air miles system regularly doesnt recognise youve flown with korean air and the claims system makes absolutely no sense so id be surprised if i ever manage to claim its hard to give them a great rating when its so hard to book with them and theyre overpriced because the whole economy here is one big monopoly but ive increased my score because their staff are goods
1496,air dolomiti,8,an enjoyable flight,the reviews prior to booking were a concern due to the reported delayscancellations without notice so i booked an early am flight from florence to connect with a midnight international flight from frankfurt to give time for things to go wrong the end result was 12 hours in frankfurt waiting for my connection as the air dolomiti flight departed and arrived within 10 minutes of the published schedule checkin staff were friendly and efficient and the cabin crew had a relaxed and efficient manner with the passengers meal snacks drinks were offered but declined for a short flight an enjoyable flight with air dolomiti
21185,turkish airlines,9,an excellent 4 hr flight,we were upgraded to business class for free on istanbul airport which was an exciting experience with the kids the seat was spacious the ife had thousands of entertainment options high speed internet for the whole duration of the flight meals were top notch and the crew were extremely pleasant with us overall an excellent 4 hr flight would definitely choose turkish airlines for future endeavors
18045,silkair,4,very slow but friendly,singapore to male lounge in singapore was very crowded food choice was ok but quality not great very weak internet connection boarding was efficient very old and dated aircraft with old recliner seats for almost 5 hours flight not great service was not convincing very slow but friendly food ok but not really good more like economy class food i would choose them only if no better option available hopefully they will invest when they integrate into sq
8049,dimonim air,7,departure time was uncertain,tanahmerah to korowai batu this route is a governmentsubsidized one operated with tiny aircraft carrying only about a dozen passengers no advance booking possible but dimonim staff were helpful in getting us on a flight the same day departure time was uncertain but we eventually got on the plane once aboard it was a great flight offering sweeping views of the rivers and rain forests below cheap too
5924,breeze airways,4,fail miserably on the reimbursement process,i have flown breeze several times and was beginning to enjoy their airline then flying back from las vegas my plane arrived at the gate on time then they had some kind of issue with how the plane was docked at the gate they tried for a couple of hours to fix it they boarded us then they had software problems or something then after a couple of hours they had us get off the plane because it was getting too hot in the las vegas summer sun who knew las vegas gets hot in the summer apparently not breeze after a few more hours they decided they could not get the plane fixed or cooled down and sent all of the passengers away saying that you could either rebook on another airline although there really werent more than a couple of expensive seats on those other airlines or get a hotel room on breeze for the night thats where the problems begin again i got a room at a nearby holiday inn express nothing lavish cost 135 after i book the room breeze sends an email and says you only have 6 days to apply for a hotel reimbursement and 20 for one meal my total very inexpensive meals were 80 for dinner and breakfast plus an uber back and forth to the airport breeze so far has only reimbursed me 20 and if i accept that payment i must click on an agreement that binds me to that settlement they are all talk at the airport about how great they will be and then they fail miserably on the reimbursement process
7320,comair,5,a bit underwhelmed,victoria falls to johannesburg first time on comair and a bit underwhelmed flight was full and fas served a sandwich and drinks but seemed bored aircraft was a boeing 737400 showing its age flight left and arrived on time so no complaints for that would i use them again yes only if i have to
3908,alitalia,2,the worst airline ever,this is the worst airline ever starting with a website that is sooo not user friendly to the extremely rude and unprofessional staff on the phone and in the airport nothing like waiting to check in and only 2 people working the counter while 6 people stand around talking to one anothers door theres about 60 people on line lazy doesnt even cover how these people acted the food on the plane was awful you could only have water to drink the food was served prison style no one smiled or even pretended to be happy you felt like they were doing you a favor just being there they picked up the trays of uneaten food and that was the last you saw of these miserable people i did ask why they werent serving and soft drinks i was told it was due to covid restrictions which i found out was false the inflight entertainment was a joke 9 hours of flying with movies from 1990 never again will i fly alitalia
12397,jetstar airways,1,the worst airline i have ever flown,this was the worst airline i have ever flown with not even worth the cheap flights wanted to do something nice for our honeymoon and we ended up stuck in bali with none of our luggage and no one knew where it was two days later it showed up at our hotel with no notice of its details we tried to get in contact for compensation and they refuse to email us back and assist us for our troubles on our flight back to the united states there was no communication telling us we needed australian visas for our layover we spent another hour and a half at the customer service desk because of our layover in sydney they are making us claim our bags in the sydney airport and then pay another big amount to recheck our bags in to fly to honolulu this airline is a scam dont fly with them they lack integrity and honesty and will do everything they can to screw you out of a dollar
12757,kenya airways,8,excellent crew on board,very good flight excellent crew on board as was the food and drink my only gripe is the business class seats could do with an update but they are comfortable none the less
7237,cityjet,5,cityjet customer review,flight and service okay but seats in avro r85 are very narrow and although legroom for a small plane is acceptable very uncomfortable
5991,breeze airways,2,seem to cancel quite regularly,they canceled flight at midnight the morning of our return flight gave us only 12 hours to find another flight discovered this at 4 am as we were sleeping when we got notified reason they gave is could not get staff not dependable flight down took off 90 minutes late what good is a cheap price if you make plans based on their schedule and they dont seem to care to honor them as they seem to cancel quite regularly if not a full flight
11104,hop,9,services are good,hop provides since a few time a regular travel from pau to paris by small jets crj700 tickets are cheap and services are the same as air france so it is a good value i never had problem with this company im used to take services are good travel are all regional in france so very short seat comfort does not take the same part as longhaul
9518,firefly,8,professional and attentive,firefly is a very good lowcost airline flying from kuala lumpur to kuala terengganu the the ticket was not very expensive the airplane quality was good with high standard of cleaniness and comfortable seats the plane was less noisy than i expected for a propellor airplane during the flight we were served a complimentary drink and food i had a curry samosa cabin staff was extremely professional and attentive the big drawback of this airline is the number of flights cancelled on the way to kuala terengganu our flight was cancelled and we were put on a later flight the day i returned from kuala terengganu out of five daily flights three were cancelled one retimed it seems that the last flight of the day is the most reliable despite being a very good quality lowcost airline it might be unsuitable to those who have time constraints
1912,air india express,2,worst experience i ever had,dubai to thiruvananthapuram flight delay for 3 hour 30 mins no ac in flight for 2 hours everyone started using magazine for air food was worst and gave only snacks when someone paying 2000aed just to get snacks in flight no soft drinks or juices gave n0 blanket give to the customers worst experience i ever had
11021,hong kong airlines,2,a flight to forget,osaka to hong kong this flight was well below par in terms of service no smile from flight attendants no slippers offered inflight meal arrived without chopsticks for starter no refill of drink and my food tray was not collected for over an hour whilst waiting for the bathroom near the middle of the aircraft i saw the cabin crew looking after the economy class were preparing drinks on trays to offer economy class passengers seems like economy class passengers had better service than business class passengers on this flight was a flight to forget economy class luggage was delivered before priority baggage the positive is it seems as if inflight meals have improved significantly the past two flights
1748,air france,1,still fight them for the proper compensation,my original flight had mechanical problems while in flight so we diverted to milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of new yorkjfk it was an awful ordeal i submitted a delay compensation request back in january and they finally approved it in september more than 8 months to process but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation i supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers they have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point and now after eight months of waiting they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount all im asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the european union nothing more nothing less
20639,tigerair australia,2,refunds not provided for change of mind,absolutely ridiculous refund policies i had no need for a flight i had booked and wanted to cancel with a weeks notice only to be told that refunds are not provided for change of mind consideration of circumstances out of control should be considered here and refusing a refund when given suitable notice is abhorrent i now have to make a trip just to avoid wasting my money i will not fly with tigerair ever again lesson learned
22936,xiamen airlines,8,impressed by this airline,hong kong to wuyishan its a leisure trip to visit the homeland of tea wuyishan fujian province xiamen airlines does a twice weekly direct flight from hong kong they deploy a small 737 aircraft similar to malaysia airlines when using this small aircraft 4 cabin crew work tirelessly to keep the journey smooth and comfortable with one aisle and 3x3 seating the pitch is quite comfortable a simple hot meal in the style of a bento box is served and is sufficient for a short 90 minutes journey 2 rounds of drinks is a nice touch seat has no power outlet or personal we were provided visual entertainment in the form of overhead tv with mainly chinese program luckily since january mobile phones in flight mode are now allowed to be used on board so you can still listen to your favourite music or watch your own videos etc on your phone or tablets that really help kill time if there is one complaint its the excessively warm cabin temperature i am impressed by this airline i wouldnt mind trying them for long haul flights in future
14185,luxair,8,very nice staff,luxembourg to copenhagen very nice staff they were helpful and smiling we received a sandwich which is rare nowadays it was a pleasure i will for sure fly again with them
15520,oman air,1,after 4 days no response,tehran to kuala lumpur via muscat onward to singapore by malaysia airlines booked for the end of december as a new student in singapore with an approved ipa letter which is the common longterm student visa in singapore and permission entry i was eligible to buy oneway ticket i sent my ipa letter to the omanair agent in tehran ika two weeks prior to my flight in order to have hasslefree connections this type of visa was new for staff hence they investigated from malaysia office and surprisingly he responded they do not let you get on the plane consequently we cannot let you boarding from tehran unless you buy a return ticket as well many students have flown oneway to singapore without any problems using their ipa letters with various airlines such as emirates qatar airways directly and even oman air t i was totally stressed and i am now as the case is still under investigation after 4 days no response i asked their chat system to remind them about my urgent case but they only answered with formality prewritten answers each time that they will contact you as soon as possible after about 6 days i called their call centre and they said the customer support department does not have telephones and you should wait for email day 6 finished and i decided to post my review here and let people like me to make a wiser decision for their flights they advertise a lot but they are not at all cooperative my issue could be resolved with a correct correspondence between two airlines but they are too slow or not willing to do so as even my agency agreed that i can travel oneway and even malaysia airlines knew ipa letter on the phone
2316,air mauritius,3,air mauritius customer review,singapore to mauritius the crew were sleeping with covers on their head at the back of the plane which were far from a warm welcome i was expecting however crew were helpful and fairly good for inflight service return leg did not meet my expectation air mauritius delayed for 25 hours and was not helpful to change my connecting flight klsingapore the ground staff in mauritius was very poor in service for check in took over 45 mins only for me
3940,alitalia,6,seats were a lot more comfortable,toronto to rome the best part about taking the premium economy with alitalia is the priority checkin and also the distinct compartment that separates the 18 seats from economy and business it also has its own toilet although on our flight it was out of order the seats were also a lot more comfortable than standard economy after those advantages the rest was not much better than standard economy the food service was hohum and there was no liquor available even on a trans atlantic flight the flight attendants were adequate in terms of attentiveness but no more the priority checkin priority baggage handling and comfortable seats were worth the added cost
177,aegean airlines,4,no warm food was offered,boarding was done with bus to remote location cabin staff were just professional but not friendly in flight service breakfast was in a cardboard box consisting of a cream and a sweet in plastic there was a option of sandwiches but they ran out with the high priced ticket a shame to provide such inflight service no warm food was offered the flight was on time ife was done through your mobile telephone and there was very limited viewing options
6058,british airways,3,arrived at the airport only 1 hour before,we were traveling as a family 5 people because of an accident by the airport we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight the kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to checkin the lady at the checkin checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass because we had no extra time we headed straight to security and didnt realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass not of the passport holder we got stuck in security because of that couldnt figure out what was wrong we only didnt miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party the staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there
11384,icelandair,4,no food for cross atlantic flights,the staff at heathrow airport checkin take forever they try to deal with customers problems like they are a airline help deskassistance office instead of checking in passengers therefore what should be a relatively quick process through checkin takes between 3060 minutes in addition they provide no food for cross atlantic flights it is insane to think they expect passengers to go 8 hours without any food
16277,porter airlines,6,enjoyed flying with porter,ottawa to toronto enjoyed flying with porter to toronto city airport this is a great experience landing on toronto islands and getting to the city by walking down a tunnel for a couple of minutes porter is a small canadian airline connecting eastern canadian cities and having a couple of us cities in their destinations too as far as my single experience with porter it was a nice one
1066,air berlin,7,good experience for exchanging miles,dusseldorf to los angeles we are talking here about the too much advertised on all their europe flights on their entertainment screens new air berlin business class seats which indeed are new the technology is great but they are to narrow i tried to sleep i couldnt it was indeed a day flight so i wasnt probably that tired i was expecting more from their sansibar exclusive menu and the portions could have been more generous and served more often for an almost 12h flight i got the opportunity to fly business as an upgrade to economy offered by the airline to its frequent flyers program and i must say it was a good experience after all not the best business class i have flown but a good experience for exchanging miles
5980,breeze airways,1,not ever fly breeze again,we have not flown with breeze before but was the only option as this was the only direct flight to final destination with that being said we will not ever fly breeze again my husband booked a trip from cincinnati to california for a golf trip breeze looses my husbands golf clubs and leaves him on standby not giving him any additional information on where his luggageclubs are five days into the trip and he still does not have his clubs breeze then told him to drive to the nearest which was two hours away from where he was staying to pick up his clubs he arrives at said airport and they still do not have the clubs breeze told him the clubs were not on that flight they offered to refund him 45 when he was charged over 120 to ship the oversize luggage to his destination he was still charged 120 for the oversize luggage but still has not received it not only is my husband out the clubs but has no update on them and is having to rent clubs daily and bought new golf shoes to accommodate breeze airlines mess up for his trip this is the worst service weve ever received lack of empathy and communication does not help the situation
1632,air europa,2,annoying inefficient customerunfriendly,i went to ibiza for a long weekend my luggage did not arrive at all communication about the status of lost luggage is poor service desk can hardly be reached refuse to speak english though i mentioned in the dialmenu that i was english speaking my luggage never arrived so my weekend was rather ruined i filed a complaint with all my damages notes etc despite many calls emails even 4 months later i have not been reimburse whatsoever very annoying inefficient customerunfriendly to their bones
19339,sunwing airlines,5,a little training badly needed,toronto to cayo santa maria my husband and i along with another couple booked an all inclusive vacation through sunwing to royalton cayo santa maria cuba first i must say that the resort was perfect in every way beautiful clean resort with a stunning beach the best part was their worldclass customer service the staff upon our arrival were so welcoming and it didnt stop for the entire week very friendly helpful and genuinely cared wanted to help and be there for anything we needed very impressive sunwing on the other hand could certainly learn much from the royalton staff at the airport on the plane and on the ground when we arrived in cuba sunwing staff kind of made us feel like they would be having a good day if it wasnt for their pesky customers bothering them a little training on customer service and how to provide it would go a long way and is badly needed at sunwing
18046,silkair,7,the flight was half empty,singapore to kota kinabalu early morning departure flight from singapore flight crew were on their first leg and looked fresh and cheerful going out on the boeing 737800 and the flight was half empty hence was lucky enough to have the side seats free which no doubt contributed to the overall sense of luxury silkair b737s are decked out in an airy light decor but the seats are a little bit spartan with only the dropdown table and a large expanse of plastic moulding which allows you to store any loose items you wish and no doubt forget about them when you depart legroom is adequate if nothing to write home about but certainly bit better than budget airlines while the b737 is always a more width constrained than the a320 pre flight service included face towels disposable packets and offers of newspapers despite a half full flight they had run out of meal choices by the time they reached me but small matter the food was never going to be the reason to fly anyway entertainment was via silkair studio bring your own electronic device and stream via wifi i was slightly amused to see that the music choices hadnt changed at all in the last 6 months though i would guess that the movie options must have changed the biggest downside is the limited toilet capacity at the rear small cramped and if you are on a full flight there will be endless queues not so on this flight though and we landed on time uneventfully
2031,air koryo,7,service was perfectly passable,i dont know how things were in the past but there is no current reason for a one star review flew from beijing to pyongyang from a comfort perspective air koryo was just like any international economy class seat yes the inflight entertainment for the 2 hour flight was basically north korean propaganda and magazines from north korea but surely if you are a tourist to north korea that is exactly what you are interested in in fact youd probably prefer that to say big bang theory episode reruns the food was average the service was perfectly passable
15735,peach aviation,5,caused me some serious concern,okinawa to hong kong in general this little budget airline get you from a to b serve is ok and menu offer is nice and not too expensive at all however the low rating concerns their safety standards there were three things that happened during the outbound and inbound flights that caused me some serious concern when landing in naha airport at night i was shocked that the cabin light was not dimmed usually in exit rows for safety reasons people with disabilities mother with infants are not allowed yet with peach a mother was allowed to sit there holding her baby and no infant seat belt was even provided landing back into hong kong a few people didnt put their window shades back up and the crew didnt care she was more concerned about where they put their bags tried to contact them via email there is actually no email address to writer to them i do like this little airline which offer very cheap tickets to japan but their standards leave me wondering
19606,taag angola airlines,7,service was mixed some friendly others less so,cape town to luanda and back on slightly older 777300 but still in good condition luanda lisbon and back on 6 month old 777300 very good condition it had larger screens than the older one but less movie options which did not quite match those listed in the inflight magazine either way selection is limited flight map system much improved in the newer plane seats the same slimline style on all planes comfortable enough with good recline and leg space pillows are provided but no blankets by default catering is decidedly low cost flimsy plastic tray and so on and cheap plastic cutlery however the food was not bad at all service was mixed some friendly others less so english definitely not spoken well luanda stopover thankfully short as airport is primitive with multiple flights leaving from the same gate at the same time which causes a bit of chaos nothing too serious though you will be checked to make sure you wont get on the wrong plane airport has no air bridges so you get a good impression of the sheer size of the 777300s as you walk up the stairs this is the most direct route from cape town to portugal hence the quickest way to get there as the feeder flights fromto cape townjohannesburg are welltimed arrival time in lisbon early morning and departure time late at night also very convenient all in all the combination of new planes nice good price with acceptable levels of service and catering make this a really good option for getting to europe from south africa
2119,air madagascar,1,air madagascar customer review,i flew economy paristana tanaantsiranana antsirananatana tanaparis in sept and oct 2014 local flights were on 737 nothing special neither bad nor good the intercontinental flight was on an old 340 the fittings were old but ok seating and food ok as well inflight entertainment a little inferior to air france smaller screen not as many choices but then again af also does not use their newest equipment on this route so that the difference is not this big two of the four flights were delayed by several hours one of which was my return flight on oct 6 to paris which was delayed by 35 hours this may become a real problem for anybody requiring a connecting flight as airmad has no codeshare partners in europe with whom one could book a combined ticket hence it cost me about 350 euro to change the reservation for my af connecting flight fortunately it could be changed and air madagascar is not willing to reimburse me referring to the conditions of sale even though airmad told me differently in tana when it became clear that the delay would cause me to miss my connecting flight in paris hence people not living near paris or marseille should take this risk into account after all my so far longest delay on an airmad flight was 13 hours in 2010 hence one should plan on long transfer times to be on the sure side i would not recommend it
11739,ita airways,6,food was a good standard,a good business class flight but for a 14 hour flight i only slept for 23 hours the crew are not overly friendly but seem to be efficient and pleasant seemed eager to please but small talk minimal dont expect the friendliness of virgin for eg the food was a good standard with 1st 2nd starter pasta course along with a main course although desserts disappointing dinner breakfast served with snacks on offer such as a rustic pie there were a couple of points to note 1 window seats offer a lot of privacy but i sat in 8a which was missing a window 2 seats are very hard leather with no mattress topping i had to use a spare duvet to make is softer but still wasnt comfortable enough 3 quite a bizarre layout with the business toilets you have to walk through the galley where the crew rest and prepare the food quite an awkward as they may be having a group chat and you feel like youre disturbing every time you use the loo
13662,level,6,get what you pay for,paris to fort de france level provides cheap long haul fares you can choose from a number of options during booking including baggage and meal options which raises the prices quite a bit after booking there was very little spam and hassle paris orly airport is a bad way to start your holiday since we deliberately did not book any food or drink options we brought plenty of foods and drinks and consuming those on board was not a problem we looked at the food that was pre booked and were surprised how small the portions were apart from that everything aboard the plane is on sale you dont get a pillow blanket or headphone but we were prepared for that crew running through the aisle serving food and drinks was a tad unnerving crew was very strict in enforcing rules ie one passenger stood up right after landing and crew immediately told him this next time they would call the police on him the seat was surprisingly comfortable with lots of leg room however we saw quite a few seats with gigantic entertainment boxes in the leg room entertainment system was free of charge movie choice seemed rather small for a long haul flight internet was available at a hefty price tag in total level is a very clear you get what you pay for airline and that is very little on both sides of the equation
5157,ba cityflyer,7,not value for money,remote stand at edinburgh with overloaded long bus ride to get there aeroplane nice but floor dirty and crumbs in harder to reach to clean places clearly given no more than a cursory wipe cabin crew didnt smile and werent chatty but were efficient cheese and tomato toastie was tasty coffee acceptable and good to get free service legroom good seat comfort good landed 5 mins late in london city and had gate furthest away from the domestic arrivals hall so long walk through corridor and up some stairs down again city airport conveniently located to get to london though basically all was fine but not amazing and not particularly premium and not worth the price a good but not value for money option
19871,tap portugal,1,avoid if you can,truly terrible avoid if you can whenever i have been unfortunate enough to fly with this company my flight has been delayed or canceled never once have things gone smoothly once when i was stuck in a city because i missed my connecting flight they set me up in a hotel that was full and here i am again at the airport knowing im that i will miss my connecting flight due to a delay the customer service has been disorganized and rude throughout every experience cant wait until they go bankrupt
19533,syrianair,4,syrianair customer review,syrian arab airlines lhrdamascuslhr flights departed ontime aircraft an a320 the crew were helpful and efficient and we were supplied with one main meal which was fine we were also given a drink during the flight havent used them for an internal flight but would be happy to use them again on an international flight
8111,dragonair,8,dragonair customer review,flew hkgcnx on da232 on 16th january boarding via a busgate flight was busy but not full crew were friendly and professional and after the expected juicebiscuits box was served i was impressed when they offered hot dim sum or eggbacon 10 minutes later
16404,qantas airways,3,please wake up qantas,perfunctory interesting word one applicable to this flight service from cgk to syd i dont know whats happened with qantas since the pandemic but for sure there has been a major decline in onboard service my issues dont stem from no welcome and totally ignored even as oneworld emerald dwelling on that would seem petty and entitled rather on the following no amenity kits for economy look on an overnight flight you would expect eye shades and a tooth brush nine given out and none in the pockets of my row no coffee or tea served before landing on a red eye flight the cabin lights come on usually an hour before landing coffee is normally served nothing this flight i wouldnt mind if this was airasia but i am paying almost 1500 for a cgksydwgn trip small things indeed count please wake up qantas having flown recently on your one world partners cathay qatar and jal i can assure you youre being left way way behind
13473,lao airlines,8,lao skyway customer review,chiang mailuang prabang flight departed on time smooth ride for a propjet served an odd but somewhat tasty snack on the short flight back of plane appears to be economy as there was an undrawn curtain between areas and the seats in the back are cloth instead of leather otherwise the seat size and pitch are exactly the same in both areas economy seats exit the plane first so its difficult to see the advantage of business seating if thats what it was friendly efficient flight attendants able to whip out meal and beverage service on a 30 mins flight
20688,tigerair australia,2,carrier is of very poor quality,sydney to melbourne the staff were helpful but our 7am plane was cancelled at 1015pm the night before and rescheduled to 230pm the plane was further delayed for over an hour due to technical issues the seats were really uncomfortable and theres no room for anyone over 58 aside from the air hostesses the carrier is of very poor quality i would not use this service if you need to someone by a certain time there are many reviews that state the same issues
17228,rwandair,9,flight was comfortable,once onboard the rwandair flight was comfortable and the cabin service and meals were good the flights each way were quite empty and passengers spread out to empty rows ife is by drop down screen and they had the same movie each way check in early as there appears to be confusion about departure times for wb100 some days of the week it leaves earlier to stop at lusaka on the way to jnb we confirmed our flight as leaving at 1810 but when arriving at the airport it indicated 1845 as the departure time we boarded the aircraft when the screens indicated that boarding would occur in 20 minutes we left at the earlier time and flew direct but it was not a day when it was scheduled to leave earlier on account of the extra stop
18809,southwest airlines,2,i was not pleased at all,my flight was originally a total of 4hr 25 mins and we were rescheduled one night prior and informed that we would not only be leaving earlier but a 6hr layover was added in another city with no explanation given this turned out trip into a 10 hour trip this inconvenienced my family greatly also i traveled with military personnel who is family my entire trip and had no issues anywhere else except for when staff at gate 41 refused to allow us back with our group we traveled as a group of 4 he scanned 2 of our passes and refused to scan the other 2 and sent us to the end of the line ultimately separating us and causing issues with our seating this staff was not pleasant and did not allow our military personnel guest use her benefits properly even after we already spent 6 hours in the uso after once again being inconvenienced this was my first time flying with southwest airlines and i was not pleased at all i am not sure ill be back
8199,eastern airways,9,found the flight comfortable,flew newcastle to birmingham with eastern airways for the first time today and found the flight comfortable and flight attendant polite courteous and professional the plane was loud but thats to be expected for a small plane i would definitely recommend and fly again with them
142,aegean airlines,4,passed only once for drinks,for a 345 hour helsinki to athens flight we got served a sandwich and the flight attendants passed only once for drinks the airline has delays particularly at flights after the morning
21992,vistara,6,nothing to complain,ok experience on time departure and arrival okay meal on board clean cabin nothing to complain meal can be improved
20248,thai smile airways,3,old planes no entertainment,had selected hindu veg meals on booking directly on thai smile website but never provided upon talking to flight attendant they said sorry it doesnt show up at my end i had someone overlook the selection when booking overall flight was average old planes no entertainment uncomfortable seats leg space was okay so that is plus check in counters were minimal so took longer in flight but staff was friendly there thai smile website didnt have good english translation and technical issues for example even if selected meals as hindu vegetarian for both passengers it never was assigned to me upon talking to fight attendants no help was offered and was not able to eat both ways
2646,air nostrum,4,my seat had been changed,this flight was reserved weeks ahead of travel and was part of a journey to enable me to travel to london with a connection in madrid firstly the website would not let me checkin online although i had chosen my seat on the same website when i reached the airport it transpired that my seat had been changed i ended up at the very back of the flight by the lavatory the flight was delayed and the lack of communication was a real concern a group of chinese passengers became anxious as they had a connecting flight and sadly the ground staff were rather rude and ignored them boarding did not follow the rules at all and was chaotic with a few passengers going back through the barrier to use the lavatory the ground staff did not seem to care one iota incredibly passengers were allowed to take on far too much luggage once in madrid a passenger realised he had left a bag behind at the airport in seville the cabin crew member did not care less and shrugged her shoulders and pointed the man to the exit
13324,lan airlines,8,lan airlines customer review,a lan airlines long haul flight from santiago to sydney via auckland that was surprisingly good once i worked out how to use flight entertainment it was easy seats were comfortable although somewhat squeezy food surprisingly good for airline food and real glass ceramic dish and metal cutlery were provided flight attendants were polite and helpful toilets were kept in check
11773,ita airways,7,i had a decent experience,i had a decent experience i was expecting the worst based on reviews since i had booked it before reading reviews they served us every couple of hours we were fed two meals and snacks in between i did get tired as it was a 14 hour flight so i stood in the back for sometime and nobody complained they had snacks and simple drinks in the back for you to self serve as well my baggage was not lost i had no problems with overweight issues and everything went smoothly in my opinion things could have been cleaner i will admit and a charging port would be great as well entertainment wasnt bad i watched two movies my only other complaint was no wifi offered
5277,bamboo airways,8,i might fly this airline again,da nang to da lat the checkout process was smooth although there was a 25 minutes delay due to the late arrival of the airplane once we boarded everything went on well the legroom was not that cramped i found the crew service even better than vietnam airlines flight i flew to da nang several days before so i might fly this airline again on my future visit to vietnam
852,air astana,9,personnel are professional and attentive,almaty to moscow every time i used air astana i was always satisfied by the service provided and attention to every detail aircrafts are ideally clean quality of food is good personnel are professional and attentive but this flight positively surprised me new aircraft updated stylish kits for passengers and especially children comfortable chairs i felt myself like i was in business class in general compared with other airlines air astana differs by its client orientation in every element of service dessert choice music responding to requests desire to do all that is possible to solve client issues cleanness inside aircrafts which is very important blankets toilets etc
13085,kulula,2,disappointed with their service,cape town to johannesburg with kulula bad service and unreliable timing paid more for front seat and did online booking flight was more than 2 hours late and could not use bag drop off had to book in again and get in queue to book in was then informed about different seat nor what we have paid for tried to change to earlier flight that was not full but ground staff totally unfriendly to help very disappointed with their service
18769,southwest airlines,3,again denied this freebie service,in 2007 southwest served 649 million cans of soda juices and water 113 million alcoholic beverages 61 million bags of pretzels 1038 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks just think how much money southwest would save if they stopped offering all those free drinks but then the public would go crazy our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights i have been on and no i dont fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route but if you do the math southwest is lost a ton of money due to the christmas flight debacle last year an average soda costs about 075 100 for the airlines once you factor in the cost of the drink itself they purchase cans the cup and the ice which isnt much on average a flight has about 150 passengers thats easily 112 150 they can put in their pocket when they cancel beverage service and thats assuming each passenger only has one drink on a recent flight the one im on as i write this we were once again denied this freebie service in the name of supposed turbulence despite a relatively smooth flight ive heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision so i asked when i asked about this instead of simply answering my question letting me know that the captain made the decision etc the flight attendant said something like let me find out a few minutes later the captain came on and explained why he felt it was important to cancel service essentially providing an excuse for why they did this when i asked for the captains name so i could verify this with swa customer service i was met with another flight attendant who basically told me were not going to do that and refused to give me his name he also threatened that they would divert the plane although i was extremely calm and was seated in my seat not yelling or anything i guess i was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear cant have more than one passenger figure out the little secret although i dont know what they are so worried about most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience let alone do anything that could actually make a difference like report this on social media or via customer service but still you dont have to hide and refuse to provide your name if you arent doing anything wrong so this is all being done in the name of safety lets go with that
6554,cathay dragon,6,cabin crew were not helpful,manila to hong kong the cabin was spacious and clean i understood that we did not have any ife monitor because it was just an hour and 55 minutes flight but they have this entertainment portal that you can access via your phone but it did not work at all so that was a flop the cabin crew were not helpful at all they were really bossy and it seems like they were not enjoying their job and would not smile i would not fly with them again

2526,air new zealand,3,disappointed by inconvenience,as tourists and having travelled lot of other places in new zelaand and the whole of australia cant help hut compare them with other airlines we found the staff to be rude on two accounts while we were waiting in the line she preferred to assist the one behind us giving them priority as a tourist from another country you always feel unwelcomed by such acts and suspects about differential treatment becomes evident in general people in nz and aus are awesome and very welcoming but this incident really shook my opinion about air new zealand and its hospitality when we put our bags she charges nzd 20 for an additional 300 gms which was actually balances by lower weight of the other bag but the disappointment cane from she not being helpful in finding a solution i would say air new zealand does not depict the true hospitality and warmth of kiwis as in general kiwis are great people disappointed by inconvenience we did not complain but paid additional charges as a tourist would do in another country for peaceful trip further

7189,cityjet,6,staff were polite and smiling,flew cityjet from dublin to paris boarding was very confusing since both doors of the plane were used but i could not see any information about which rows should use which door apparently no one else saw it either since lots of people tried to pass each other inside once seated everything went smoothly and we arrived on time a sandwich was served but no alternative for us who do not eat gluten coffee was not too bad legroom was almost better than on the connecting air france airbus staff were polite and smiling since this was not a long flight i found it perfectly ok even though the confusion at boarding should be easy to avoid
10809,hainan airlines,9,i had a satisfied flight,chongqing to new york when i booked the flight it was the new reverse herringbone business class configuration but unfortunately the aircraft was changed in the last day to a 222 configuration which i didnt like it much the aircraft was full the crew maintained a very high level of service its the longest route of hainan after the dinner service and few hours of sleeping everyone woke up and started to ask for dining there were few seats in business class had problems with the usb charger another few in economy had problems with the entertainment system cabin crew explained and tried to make it up to those passengers i had a satisfied flight in the end really appreciate the effort of all flight attendants onboard

8945,etihad airways,3,dirty cabin with incompetent crew,i was looking forward to the premium experience of etihad that immediately ended as soon as i boarded the b787 in zurich old worn dirty cabin with incompetent crew only got worse when boarding the b777 in abu dhabi for 13hrs to melbourne with wife myself literally on top of each other middle seats it was too close even for married couples but would be a nightmare and not possible for strangers cannot believe etihad can have this cabin on popular long haul legs only saving grace was excellent fa on my side of the aisle who was apologetic and somewhat embarrassed about the cabin but did a great job on service
4014,allegiant air,2,flight was delayed by 4 hours,our flight was delayed by 4 hours last minute no compensation customer service said they had no idea why the flight was delayed then the departing flight from vegas was delayed an hour and once we did board an hour after that we are all told that the air conditioning on the plane is broken theyre very quick to apologize for the inconveniences first time flying allegiant air probably my last
259,aer lingus,1,customer service is trash,checked in both of us for our flight the next day via the app no issues obtaining my husbands boarding pass however for some reason mine was completely inaccessible both on the app and website and the agents available via chat on the aer lingus website may as well just be bots given they clearly just copypaste template excuses rather than actually making any means of an attempt to help customers no semblance of an explanation or effort given to help whatsoever now when we get to the airport in the morning well be forced to wait in the checkin line for absolutely no good reason in addition to all of the others way to punish a paying customer for your own site and mobile apps shortcomings aer lingus customer service is trash
18310,singapore airlines,3,dont provide salt and pepper,no pillows in economy cabin for a 13hr flight i was offered an extra blanket to use as a makeshift pillow hardly comfortable meal portions were small no salad or small starter was offered no towelette and they dont provide salt and pepper sachets with the meal wifi was erratic and terminal 2 is a non event due to renovations all in all a highly unsatisfactory experience and we will think twice before flying singapore airlines again

1201,air canada,6,plane was the least comfortable,this was a new plane and it was the least comfortable i have been on an overseas flight the legroom was unacceptable for an overseas flight and combined with a poorly designed seat it led to significant back pain that lasted for the next day i will avoid this plane and this airline if necessary though otherwise i like it at all costs
15666,openskies,5,openskies customer review,flew june 29 2012 in new eco service 3x3 for last 11 rows of plane this would be difficult travel for strangers in same row very much domestic type economy seats unusual policies also asked if i could buy an upgrade and they said i could have but it would have been only at the ticket counter at the ticket counter i was told to ask at the gate difficult to get checked in with contract service handling flight the gate area was chaotic and that is being generous had to ask about lounge pass which as sapphire one world they were to recognize they gave it and told me to use priority security lines but the boarding pass and code would not work as it needed to be generated at time of boarding pass from the time i booked the flight to when we took it they instituted eco class when booked i thought i was coming back through ewr and would be worth the trouble because i would have economy plus 2 weeks before the scheduled flight they changed config to add 3rd class of service i would not do that again we were fortunate to have 3 seats for 2 of us but had the class been full it would have been a nightmare for 8 hours nice cabin crew lousy food ipads for entertainment were a plus
4639,asiana airlines,4,horrible shell seat,seoul to manila a 35 hr flight the a330300 was archaic horrible 1st generation shell seats this is the same seat that is on the boeing 747400 simply awful narrow making it impossible to sleep on your side ife was virtually nonexistent food was marginal service was okay

8387,edelweiss air,6,a pleasant surprise,dubrovnik to zurich flying business with edelweiss was a pleasant surprise this low cost branch of swiss offered excellent service great food and excellent comfort the only downside was that there was no access to airport lounge at departure which was very dissatisfying as it is one of the main reasons i chose to fly business
17408,s7 siberia airlines,8,s7 siberia airlines customer review,i often use s7 for short hops between kiev and moscow they manage to serve hot dinner on such a short flight their planes are new and in good condition online purchase and checkin as well as intown checkin in moscow work fine good choice and good value for money the only minus is that they are always 3040 minutes behind schedule

20430,thomson airways,6,would probably fly thomson again,this flight with thomson from birmingham to montego bay was rather disappointing in some parts however parts of the flight were good the flight took off from birmingham on time always a good thing because it is a longhaul flight they served complimentary drinks and around 3 hours into the flight they served lunch it was sausage and some sort of mashed potato with veggies they served it with crackers cream cheese and unusually jelly beans around 2 hours before landing they served afternoon tea however landing went well until we got to immigration where there was a large queue but that wasnt the airlines fault the return flight was delayed with no clear explanation we made the time up and landed 20 minutes early however boarding was quite quick once we got airborne the inflight services commenced and shortly after it was meal time i was served a traditional sunday dinner which consisted of chicken potatoes broccoli and carrots it came with crackers and cream cheese again plus a milky way chocolate bar then into the early hours of the morning breakfast was served it was sausage beans omelette and a hash brown it was served with orange juice once we landed at birmingham getting through immigration was very quick all in all the flight was good and i would probably fly thomson again
12150,jet2com,3,never fly this airline again,manchester to lanzarote uncomfortable seats flights delayed both ways on the way out i had an extra legroom seat but they forgot to load the tables meaning i had to put a sandwich and drink on my knee unsafe and inconvenient the in flight announcements are the most patronising loud and annoying i have ever heard i fly many times a year and will never fly with this airline again
18448,skybus,3,skybus customer review,fllcmh the latest us startup airline that is embracing the very low costhigh restriction fare ala carte pricing for checked bags and everything for sale onboard model my morning flight left ft lauderdale on time and arrived in columbus a few minutes early i had checked in online and needed no assistance as i was not checking a bag the friendly flight attendants offered a sales catalog after boarding and customers had a large selection of food and drink items as well as dutyfree type personal items jewelryperfumes also for sale my return flight was delayed on landing and then reported a problem with the pilots radio which was a surprise given that the airline operates a brandnew fleet of narrow body airbus finally after a delay of more than 4 hours we boarded another aircraft that had arrived late from another city and finally made it home by 215 am on this flight all entree items were sold out and only snack items were available to eat customers were not offered any sort of compensation for the delayed flight just apologies from the airport and inflight crew
19221,sun country airlines,2,we will never fly sun country again,i was trying to check online since check in bags are less expensive for some reason the airline website does not allow meaning the airline wanted us to pay a more terrible price for the baggage it is business and i think it is where big income for them comes in check in luggage we will never fly sun country again
21386,united airlines,3,with absolutely no help,our first flight was delayed two hours for a myriad of reasons all different from the last and we were not notified by the united employee when we checked in at the asheville regional airport this two hour delay would have resulted in missing our connection and the international flight from lax to mel but we found a flight out of clt to lax with absolutely no help from the avl united employee he gave us a phone number to call and sent us on our way saying there was nothing he could do for us even though he had just finished helping the couple in front of us with the same itinerary delays made it to lax in time to catch the initial flight to mel after booking the flight ourselves made it to our seats only to wind up sitting on the tarmac for two hours due to a flat tire caused by running over a washer read negligence on the runway by the time the tire was fixed the crew was over their authorized hours and the flight was canceled we were told that we would be rebooked to our initial destination melbourne but we were rebooked to sydney which is about 539 miles off our initial destination in order to solve this we were directed to another united customer service desk where we stood in line for an hour with 50 united customers dealing with similar rebooking issues it was 200 am by the time we were able to talk to a united customer service employee and good god i wish we hadnt for two hours we stood at that counter and did not get a straight answer to our questions ie he told us he booked tickets for our party of 4 on the same alternative route to melbourne but when we checked our itineraries the flights were still destined for sydney or to our surprise brisbane when we asked for the tickets to be printed we were told there were only 2 even though all 4 of us at the counter repeatedly had to remind him there were 4 of us on top of this a customer that had been previously helped cut his way in line twice to commandeer paxs attention even though we requested he wait so we could have a chance to get our stuff sorted out as well it was 430 am at this time we were given a motel voucher by pax and told we had rooms booked for the night but when we called the motel to verify we were informed we had no bookings and there were no rooms available cots were eventually provided for customers that didnt have any options other than spending the night in the airport only to be collected about an hour and a half later the united customer service line has been long and slow moving all day already which indicates that these issues are still persisting and united is not prioritizing the one thing it needs to its customers
2365,air moldova,7,thanks to the staff,chisenau was our layover stop between london and krasnodar and our plane with air moldova was delayed for a substantial amount of time leaving us worried that we would miss our next flight however we were able to board our plane to krasnodar thanks to the staff at air moldova knowing that we along with a couple of other passengers were getting close to missing our next plane the cabin staff ensured that we were the first to disembark the plane once at the chisenau airport staff took us directly to our next plane which would have taken us much longer if the kind staff had not taken us via the quickest route without them we would have definitely missed our flight
21803,virgin america,8,would definitely fly again,san diego to boston via san francisco with virgin america found an absolutely miraculous deal on this flight it was a through flight so i didnt have to change planes in sfo we just got off grabbed some food and got back on even with parents of a toddler next to me i was comfortable in my seat and due to the live tv stream and the time of this year almost everyone was watching the olympics which was kind of fun the staff was attentive and brought any drinks i ordered almost immediately i didnt buy any food but the people next to me did twice its a long flight and they had a toddler both times it was easy for them and their food came quite quickly would definitely fly again
7249,cityjet,7,cityjet customer review,flew luxlcy a very pleasant flight even if it was short the fokker 50 aircraft was lovely and although old and a bit falling apart was comfortable enough with plenty of legroom cabin crew were delightful and distributed a choice of croissant or pain au chocolate and water or orange juice half way through the flight which was nice captain gave announcements throughout the flight on the slightly old and crackly pa system the inflight magazine was dull check in was very easy however we were charged 60 euros for 2 check in bags as we had not payed for them in advance this is disappointing for a full service airline charging for luggage overall a great flight
15466,oman air,5,oman air said they would pay it back,after posting my last message on this site oman air have communicated with me again to ask me for the same information i have sent before they tell me once again they will answer within 15 days its just playing for time this is six times now we had to cancel the flight due to covid restrictions we waited the year in accordance with the airlines regulations oman air said they would pay it back in line with their regulations

22018,vistara,9,onboard experience for these short flights is top notch,goa to bombay in an a320neo in business class vitaras onboard experience for these short flights is top notch good seats good service good snacks my one complaint is the choice of music in flight india is a land with a great musical tradition and instead of featuring an indian music selection vistara for some reason has decided to go with bad western music also when is vistara going to provide inflight wifi

6867,china airlines,5,bad experience in my baggage,manila to vancouver via taipei my overall experience is okay needs further improvement on the audio also the food should be improved aesthetically and by flavor our taste buds arent much functional when in high altitude so it is a must that aroma and flavor of the food compliments each other or else all of the food will just taste all pretty much the same i had a bad experience in my baggage when the ground steward in manila told me that my baggage will go straight to saskatoon my final destination and not to be picked up in vancouver since i was a new flyer i didnt know much of this i even clarified twice with the steward if i will be picking it up in saskatoon or vancouver and he kept on saying that its gonna be in saskatoon but when i arrived in saskatoon my baggage wasnt there so much inconvenience on my part they need to have welltrained and knowledgeable staff when it comes to these types of situation or a mentor should be around in this case with this i dont know if i will fly with china airlines anymore
3337,airasia philippines,1,thus far refused to refund,airasia philippines has thus far refused to refund the sum of a cancelled flight back to my bank account even though it promised to do so out of all airlines i have used this one seems to be the worst there are no words for the lack of service i have received after putting so much trust in them

8907,ethiopian airlines,7,i had enjoyable flights with ethiopian,both flights were on time the seats were in a 222 configuration with no direct aisle access of window seats plenty of legroom but no privacy due to the rather old seating sufficient entertainment system with good amount of movies and music no wifi at all on both flights because of the aircraft type b7878 crew was helpful and courteous at all times food was average probably because of the pandemic it was more like premium economy all in all i can say i had enjoyable flights with ethiopian
12942,klm royal dutch airlines,1,both times they have cancelled my flight,flight was cancelled due to an accident the day before i was automatically rebooked to a flight 6 days later with two long layovers after much complaining i was eventually offered a flight that is only 4 days late still with two long layovers i accepted the offer got no response or confirmation and when i did get a response that offer was gone i said anywhere in the right country works if it will get me home sooner and quicker and showed multiple screenshots of the tickets for better flights they still had available for purchase on their website for four times the price of my original return ticket of course they denied that those were actually available and eventually offered me the same two and a half day journey arriving four days late but to a different city this time i have only flown klm twice and both times they have cancelled my flight home and i have spent hours trying to get a solution out of their support i am still stuck in a different country so cant comment on the claims process yet but based on my other interactions with the company im sure i will be stuck with the bill
2188,air malta,3,air malta customer review,i fly this route from malta to amsterdam almost every week and try to avoid air malta as much as possible but sometimes this is not possible even prefer an indirect flight over a direct air malta flight recently additional surprises occurred for months now when flying air malta you get a latvian old lease boeing no room fully booked
19412,surinam airways,3,choose an alternative,miami to georgetown flight from miami was delayed an hour return trip with connecting flight from georgetown was also delayed an hour causing a missed connecting flight and an additional layover of combined 9 hours with additional cost of 2nd piece of luggage do to sending my son ahead with me checking his luggage in approached management and told it was my fault in not allowing 2 hours for getting thru customs told him that is incorrect as there was a 2 hour layover but they were an hour late he says no we were only 46 minutes late wow so when flying surinam airlines make sure you dont have to depend on ontime flights as they were late both times i used them in 5 days not a good record choose an alternative if promptness is important
9313,fiji airways,4,handled issue extremely poorly,suva to nadi we had originally booked a return ticket but the first part was cancelled due to the cyclone e mail but no follow up compensation or chance to rebook all their lines said busy anyway this was a short uneventful flight on fiji time in that it was late but being under half hour didnt matter check in was the most basic experienced and boarding was via steps from the back would not recommend as they handled the cyclone issue extremely poorly
1382,air china,6,planes are quite old and dirty,sydney to stockholm via beijing really old and rugged airplanes and very little leg room but the worst part is that the cabin crew makes constant inflight announcement each time there is a little bump of turbulence there is an announcement in chinese and english it is impossible to make use of ife system and i recommend a good pair of noise cancelling headphones cabin crew speaks poor english but are nice and let me change seats to the emergency seats without having to pay extra i am 192 cm tall so very worth while lounge staff in beijing were ok but one woman went out of her way to change our seats in the lounge making sure that we got better seats and even bumped us up to emergency row also on the second leg of our trip very appreciated i have never had any issues flying with air china but i know that chinese ground services customer service can be very inadequate and unhelpful so happy i have not had to deal with that overall planes are quite old and dirty and food is poor but value for money is great and it got us to our destination back and forth without any mishaps

15636,onur air,4,onur air customer review,gatwick to dalaman a typical no frills airline the worst part of the process is checking in the queues at gatwick were ridiculous we arrived 2 hours before the flight and by the time we had checked in and got through the long security queues our flight was on the last call the flight was okay and i felt safe enough with onur although the plane did look pretty old and the legroom was probably the worst i have ever had the staff were friendly enough but ours was a night flight leaving at 1025 pm and they didnt ever turn the lights out so if you want any sleep on a flight dont fly onur
1043,air berlin,3,checkin staff unfriendly and impatient,tel aviv to berlin with air berlin so everything starts in the airport we arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight the checkin staff were really unfriendly and impatient told us that the flight was full and we cant move for another seats we sat near the toilet but when we arrived at the airplane we saw a lot of free seats after the takeoff we were expecting for a little snack or a sandwich but we didnt get anything the whole flight its unbelievable because we paid 800 per ticket i dont know whats the problem with air berlin because its not the first time i am flying with them at the past they were an excellent airline not recommended
12276,jetblue airways,2,they refused to let me board,i googled extensively and was flying to see a friend in barbados who said no entry requirements and that you will fill out the form once you land in barbados 30 minutes before my flight leaves i get called to the boarding desk to show the entry form and barcode which i of course did not have i tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working it is not required beforehand and this was from an official immigration officer at barbados im not angry at the people at the boarding desk because i do understand they were doing their job but they refused to let me board the plane until i had this particular document which i could not get at all because the site is not working a nice manager walked out and had to get on a computer for 20 minutes and by so miracle got it handled so i could board the plane i was livid and so upset that i was not going to be allowed to board my plane over something that is not even necessary truly the immigration officer at barbados thought the whole thing was ridiculous and everyone else on the plane coming from the us was able to fill out their form at customs they thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the san jose airportjet blue demanded i have that and almost denied me getting on that plane the first plane ride was 4 hours and a red eye and absolute hell they kept the lights on the entire time and the flight attendants kept coming up and down the aisle hitting me with elbowtray at least 20 times they were angry 40 minutes before landing they start screaming at everyone to wake up and the person next to me in the middle seat had her seat back and was sound asleep with her hood over her eyes a flight attendant walked up and stood over me to forcibly yank her seat back yank her hood off and tell her towake up they then just glared at me to remove the bag off my lap while we still had 30 minutes to land on my next flight to barbados no one asked for this stupid entry form when i was boarding which i thought was super comical i was in a middle seat and when i sat down there was stuff in the aisle seat but no one around flight attendants kept asking me over and over whose stuff it was and im like dont know finally a sweet older lady comes up with a cane and says everybody calm down i was at the back of the plane allowing everyone to come though because its really hard for me to get up and down come to find out the poor lady had a knee injury flight attendants were so rude to her i had been flying for over 12 hours and was extremely thirsty and kept getting such attitude when i asked for water i asked one male attendant who never brought it to me when i asked the female attendant a second time for more water in my water bottle and a sparkling water she rolls her eyes and fills up my water bottle halfway and doesnt give me a sparkling water and just walks away

19685,tam airlines,1,tam airlines customer review,i had flown with tam in several occasions and i had a good experience before i cant say the same in this case their customer service is awful we had to wait one hour in the business check in counters because nobody was there after one hour there they told us that our flight which was international had to be attended in the domestic flights area and after another half an hour waiting there they werent able to introduce our rewards card into the system i dont why but after almost two hours trying to make the check in we only wanted to leave worst ground service ever

384,aeroflot russian airlines,2,they managed to lose my baggage,perm to new york via moscow in 4 days they managed to lose my baggage on the way to and from my destination connecting time in sheremetyevo 3 hours the telephone they provide on their website and via general hotline for lost baggage in sheremetyevo are never answered you get an automatic answer that everyone is busy and you should call later i tried approximately 50 times in different times never succeeded emails are not being answered at the moment something goes wrong nobody cares
23032,xl airways france,7,service was really good,san francisco to paris with xl airways france i was really concerned after reading all the negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised to have a good experience there were 3 of us and the money savings was a lot since we saved so much i upgraded our seats to more legroom very reasonably priced on the way back we were able to get an emergency row for the 3 of us 50 each the service going and coming back was really good we had a meal snacks coffee tea and water free of course there was other stuff for sale like on all flights legroom in general is not that different from most of the major us airlines seat width is pretty narrow the video entertainment is bad but they do rent tablets with videos games and documentaries for 1000 well worth it even with all the extras it was still a big savings the worst part of xl is their online booking its easy to book your tickets but if you have any questions forget getting hold of someone reserving your seats only if your lucky i was able to book our seats about 3 weeks before our trip from sfo to paris but not return when we went to the airport to check in i asked about getting return seats they said ask in paris they couldnt paris said you cant reserve seats until day of flight we got to the airport about 25 hours prior to flight and easily reserved our seats on our departure flight i noticed a lot of people angry about an extra charge for overweight luggage its shown everywhere what the weight limit is so we didnt have any issues the weight limit is very reasonable 44lbs for a check in bag no charge and 5kg which is about 11lbs for carry on if youve got the money to spend at least 400 and more for each ticket for an airlines with more frills go for it but i think you would have to pay at least 600 more to really feel the difference waiting for ticket
5781,blue panorama airlines,2,fly a different airline,rome to tirana worst airline i have known checked in and when time to board came nothing happened flight got delayed by 6 hours and then 6 hours later boarding got delayed again everything is bad about this airline do yourselves a favour and fly a different airline even if its a bit more expensive
11049,hong kong airlines,3,an awful irresponsible and inconsiderate airline,my connecting flight from hong kong to bangkok was suddenly cancelled and changed to a flight 10 hours later only 2 days before i was on my trip without the internet and just got informed about it when i checked in at beijing the ground staff in beijing could not help with anything i asked for an earlier flight any hotel any lounge service they said i have to contact hong kong airlines myself why would you have a ground service that cannot support a passenger that needs help i flew to hong kong just to find out that all rooms at airport hotels were fully booked i went back to hong kong airlines ground counter they could not help with any accommodation and only provided earlier flight to bangkok after a lot of begging now 6 hours from the original one my wife and i were stranded in the airport without support from the airline for 67 hours when we came back to drop our luggage for the new flight still no assistance and we had to wait in the long queue for over 30 minutes if we knew that we can get an earlier flight we wouldnt have taken out our luggage and just used transfer lounge to wait or even book a hotel in advance the airline just did as it pleased and didnt care about passenger experience at all such an awful irresponsible and inconsiderate airline i dont recommend to anyone this was my first and my last flight with hong kong airlines
5731,blue islands,6,blue islands customer review,lcyjerlcy in atr42s each way this airline tries hard but falls short in some areas online checkin did not work at the advertised time 48 hours i called customer services and the rather indifferent phone operator casually told me it was always like that secondly passengers should be aware of their unusual baggage allowance the checked plus carryon can total 20 kg nevertheless carryon weight was not checked at either lcy or jer we arrived at city airport and couldnt find the bagdrop desk told to use the luxair desk aircraft itself was showing its age and could do with a deep clean but was comfortable one member of cabin crew for 50 passengers and each way they were cheerful and pleasant on the outbound morning flight a croissant with butter and jam was offered with nonalcoholic drinks on the return evening flight there was a full bar service even champagne but no snacks blue islands passengers can use their dedicated lounge at jer however its based at gate 7 which is at the far end of the airport and not air conditioned drinks biscuits and wifi were good overall a good airline but should certainly bring their london operations more into line with their competitors
19304,sunwing airlines,1,not be using this company again,they delayed our flight 3 times and we waited at the airport for 8 hours before we could fly we missed the whole first day of our trip with no refund waiver that was applicable to us as they said in the policy for flight delays for 3 hours it had nothing to do with any type of storm flight was also delayed 1hour on the way back and also waited 3 more hours for our luggage in total of 12 in delays will not be using this company again nothing but problems after problems
6032,british airways,4,things have really deteriorated,my family and i have flown mostly on british airways for the last 30 years i am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name they used to be a really good airline to fly with things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic the aircraft look worn for example on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice finally working in the last hour before we landed the second time around i think the reset was done for the whole aircraft the touch screen function on my screen did not work the usb charger ports on my seat did not work the staff were pleasant enough but their service oozed mediocrity there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing the food has been the worst part on our ba flights since the pandemic they gave us a menu asked what wed like did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else they then told us that wed get first choice at the second service which they couldnt deliver on finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did the food was tasteless we take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this to no avail as a family of 3 we fly british airways medium to long haul regularly possibly 46 times a year each for us the good things about flying ba are that we are priority customers usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground when checking in and in the lounges when we use them
19622,taag angola airlines,1,taag angola airlines customer review,i have flown with saa before and with taag the flights on taag have not been to bad i unfortunately do not understand or speak portuguese and this i find a problem with regards to the service i cannot complain i have a complaint about the airport personnel at luanda they are rude pass comments on all foreign clients and give us a hard time in general should you have any dollars with you they confiscate them and tell you that you cannot keep the money with you this i have a problem with if you cannot keep your dollars on you how are you supposed to buy any cold drink or food while you wait for the flight this is not complimentary from taag the airport is dirty to boot today i am struggling with my ticket back to jnb and will most certainly not make use of taag again i will use saa in future as i can depend on them
10487,go first,1,flight was delayed 4 times,the pathetic service flight was delayed 4 times no one is there to take responsibility or to answer people dont know whom to ask because no single staff is there to attend extremely irritated

6600,cathay pacific airways,2,cathay pacific airways customer review,our international trip started wrong on december 25th 2022 when the pilot and crews of cathay pacific got covid we received a last minute notice that the flight was delayed for 18 hours later at the cathay pacific airport counter it took 35 hours to rebooked us to singapore airlines upon arrival to the final destination we lost 1 of our suitcase and neither cathay pacific nor singapore airlines want to be responsible with it they made it hard for me to file for lost claim and has become unresponsive to my inquiry this has been a very stressful trip and unprofessionally handled we had to extend the trip for a full day and we were traveling with little kids imagine that
7889,cubana airlines,5,cubana airlines customer review,santiago de cubahavana in an il96 we arrived very early at the airport as recommended and the checkin was quick and efficient but not very friendly the flight was a domestic continuation of a flight from paris and operated on time the seats on board had adequate legroom but a hard bar across the lower back made them rather uncomfortable while the boarding passes had allocated seats in fact passengers could sit anywhere except in the front area which was for the international passengers some young men not in uniform seemed to be security staff enforcing nonmixing of international and domestic passengers for most of the flight the cabin lights were totally extinguished it was an evening flight and the personal reading lights didnt work the cabin crew disappeared while the plane was in flight no refreshments were served on arrival the plane docked at the international terminal where as ensured by the security staff the passengers from paris disembarked via an air bridge while we were bussed a long way to the domestic terminal and waited a long time for our luggage overall cubana is an effective and interesting way to get from a to b but dont expect any frills by the way our booking through an international booking engine worked fine
9402,finnair,6,no champagne when boarding,no champagne when boarding apparently some rule that finnair cant serve alcohol on the ground so blueberry juice or orange juice upgraded interior looks good but seats are so uncomfortable poor selection for breakfast in business class and for prelanding food was the only option a chicken skewer 1 hour free wifi but you cant pause it so when you have logged in you better go the whole hour
3576,airbaltic,2,why so cheap,tallinn to milan i was dreading flying with it for a cause i was forced to fly with it why so cheap no normal beverages or food on the plane and then you have to pay 60 euros even if youve paid for your carryon luggage why do you have to do it
12019,jet airways,5,food is not good at all,goa to london via mumbai the onboard food is not good at all half of it was very hot gravy and the rest was cold and it did not taste very well too the cabin crew were polite and served the meals at appropriate times but the seats were not very comfortable for an 8 hour journey the onboard entertainment system was okay and had some of the latest movies out at that time but the monitors and headphones were horrible the headphones were very cheap and seemed a bit damaged the monitors were of the lowest resolution possible but were watchable i do not want to criticize the airlines a lot though looking at the difficulties they are facing right now due to the economy overall i would recommend this airline for a budget journey but expectancies should not be high regarding comfort
5133,azerbaijan airlines,3,azerbaijan airlines customer review,my worst flying experience in 11 years of former soviet union travel on january 13 2008 the airport in baku was closed because the airport is not equipped with any modern snow cleaning equipment personnel checking us in in tblissi in georgia without telling us anything with a delay of 7 hours in order to not let us return the tickets and book an alternative route through kiev no food no drinks no apologizing arriving in baku after midnight no information whatsoever a crowded airport without any modern facilities no airport representative ever turned up no food no drinks no apologizing finally with a delay of another 17 hours checkin at the departure lounge we were forced to wait for 2 hours without being allowed to go out and use the toilet aggressive unfriendly personnel at the airport the aircraft was covered with snow no cleaning equipment was at hand to clean away the snow from the top of the aircraft other passengers told us they already had similar experiences when flying from moscow through baku stay away from azerbaijan airlines if you can
7513,copa airlines,5,impersonal service,on time performance seat sleep comfort affected by the narrow feet rest area impersonal service with generic food poor amenity kit loud advertising running in a continuous loop until take off not taking in account the late departure time in the night good ife with terrible outdated film choices mediocre headphones
5795,blue1,6,blue1 customer review,helmuc on tired md 87 took the internet upgrade opportunity for 4900 to premium economy worth it on ground service quick checkin fast track at security as economy pax had a long queue for both the sas lounge in helsinki very basic cabin crew friendly nice breakfast however no english newspapers available and no comments at all to the flight from the cockpit the price for the upgrade is ok as i had 2 rows for me alone in contrary to the economy cabin which was 95 full otherwise you are flying low cost with a high economy fare
5057,avianca,5,catering is shameful,los angeles to bogot business class seats great catering is shameful tiny portion of food and water no coffee on a colombian airline crew sat at front and chatted for hours bathrooms uncleaned we got there and back largely on time but really the catering manager should be ashamed online side of operation is glitchy and tricky seatbelt signs kept on for no apparent reason
18850,spicejet,3,seats were not as expected,one of the worst experiences on a flight i was heading out from new delhi to bangalore and it was not worth the effort the seats were not as expected cleaned the seat covers was teared from one side likewise the seat which is allotted to me dont had the seat movable button since it was broken so all through the entire excursion i needed to sit truly awkward
2535,air new zealand,5,very disappointed with air new zealand,very disappointed with air new zealand ill avoid flying with air new zealand if i can in the future on both occasions this year it has departed late 45mins when flying to us and 0ne hour this time flying to asia which made me miss a connection in the us and recently bags did not arrive at final destination due to late arrival for connecting flight barely had 30mins to run to connecting terminal also running out of food in biz class is a first on the occasion ive flown biz class with other airlines ive never experienced this portions were very small and im a small eater barely had any service for snacks in between meals so was quite hungry service wasnt impressive by comparison to other airlines i think air new zealand can do better and spend on improving service plus departing on time rather than fancy adverts
13562,latam airlines,1,suitcase had a nonrepairable damage,every flight with latam 4 in total during my 3 months latin america tour was a disaster both in premium eco and business no lounge for star alliance gold clientsbusiness passengers in cusco no service on board not even water priority luggage was the last on the conveyor belt and my suitcase had a nonrepairable damage 1h to take up the damage by the staff and the status quo after weeks of complaints is that they are not willing to pay more than 80 usd despite the luggage being new
19662,tam airlines,5,just hope things improve,london to sao paulo with tam airlines left london on time cabin staff very helpful and plane clean and comfortable food served for dinner and breakfast ok although only 1 alcoholic drink offered with dinner vod worked with latest films and water offered during the night arrived on time at sao paulo and then disaster struck eventually informed after 1 hour wait that onward flight to santiago would not be departing at 730am but 10pm after walking around the airport and queueing for 2 hours and retrieving luggage we were eventually given vouchers for a taxi to dump of a hotel on the outskirts of soa paulo stuck there all day no leisure facilities industrial buildings surrounding the hotel and having to arrange hotel shuttle bus back to airport have several more flights booked with tam airlines on package holiday to south america so just hope things improve
14627,martinair,4,martinair customer review,yyzamsyyz legroom was okay got the exit row on the way back food decent for a charter seat width normal unlike air transat they dont squeeze an extra row of seats in i didnt feel the need to upgrade to economy plus the personal entertainment device portable hard drive with monitor was great worth the 12 euro on the day flight back
6296,bulgaria air,4,bulgaria air customer review,not really pleased i usually travel from sofia to london heathrow and back the delays are usual complete lack of entertainment there is lack of space too
15947,philippine airlines,3,check in counter staff wont help you,based on my experience and that of my colleagues i strongly advise everyone to avoid philippine airlines when flying from singapore to manila especially during the evening aside from delays due to manila airport congestion the check in counter staff in singapore changi airport wont help you if you wish to take an earlier flight they would outright tell you to go to the ticket office in downtown singapore its such a hassle if youre already at the airport and the check in for the earlier flight is almost closing they didnt even bother to take a look at my ticket i was so frustrated that no policy for goshows was put in place but still in the end i thank amanda one of the handling agents for her candour because according to her without assurances from the ticket office or anyone from philippine airlines she might be liable for penalties in case they bumped me to an earlier flight for free sadly my pr512 flight which was scheduled at 1905 was delayed for almost 3 hours without any compensation im never flying philippine airlines from singapore to manila ever again
4559,arkefly,9,arkefly customer review,flew back from barbados to newcastle after a thomson cruise this was probably the best thomson flight we have had there were complimentary drinks entertainment newspapers etc and i have to say the food provided was good by airline standards the plane was a 767 and probably only a couple of years old i would have given 10 for satisfaction if it had not been for a 2 hour delay
13997,lot polish airlines,1,impossible to get hold of anyone,within 15 hours after booking i had to cancel ie well within the 24 hour cancellation window first of all virtually impossible to get hold of anyone eventually tried facebook messenger as recommended on th lot website took almost an hour to cancel the ticket after which i was informed that it would tale up to 47 working days to receive the refund never ever experienced a similar lack of service level this was without any doubt the first and last time i considered flying with lot
6617,cathay pacific airways,5,the overall experience was very poor,apart from a very kind helpful and polite cabin crew the overall experience was very poor the seats were very uncomfortable and rows too tight the food was about the worse i have ever had on a long flight no night set no basic hygiene kit a lot to improve compare to the top notch companies like qatar airways emirates etihad singapore airlines ana etc although the entertainment offer was satisfying the screen was really slow
16398,qantas airways,6,service was poor,this must be the prime business route for qantas and very important for them given all the options now available with other airlines the service was poor well meaning staff but chaotically managed the food on this and other stages was nondescript and unattractively served long delays between courses and collecting up no help offered with preparing bedding etc the whole experience emphasised how by comparison ba has managed to spruce up and recover its business service standards and is for the moment an incomparably better way of getting to and from australia
18010,sichuan airlines,8,sichuan airlines customer review,shenzhen chongqing new a320 good service mandarin with no local accent poor english but acceptable for a regional flight okay food toilet clean
12006,jet airways,9,surprisingly pleasant,cdgbom and maacdg with connections to vie with austrian surprisingly pleasant longhaul flights jets b777 as with most of other operators who have them in 343 configuration has cramped seating with insufficient legroom and width ife with sufficient content but screen could be better a333 on the other hand is fitted with very spacious seats both in terms of width and legspace and perfectly responding ife screens all meals on both legs were tasty breakfast could be bigger though cabin crew warm and wellmannered on both legs present in cabin for the whole flight duration and providing extra snacks and drinks upon request flights departed and arrived on time on the return leg checked bag got stuck in cdg and was delivered one day later to my home however this is mostly fault of the airport for not being able to transfer it between aircrafts jet can be hardly blamed and air france as the ticketing carrier handled the issue in quick and efficient manner jet ground staff in maa asking ridiculous security questions eg why is a czech citizen flying to austria and not czech republic as if it was their business anyhow and prolonging the whole checkin process unnecessarily jet pleasantly surprised me on both flown legs cdgbom and maacdg and hopefully they will survive their current financial situation as they have a good thing going on at least on longhaul choose a333 over b777 if possible as it is in all aspects superior
4665,asiana airlines,9,be very happy to fly them again,seoul incheon to london this was my first flight with asiana airlines which i took after having checked it had the new business class it was an excellent flight configuration is 121 seats are wider than on british airways and theres pretty good storage service was excellent food was good wifi worked perfectly small quibble but movies were mostly poor quality ie poorly reviewed and not as extensive as the best systems all in all an excellent trip and id be very happy to fly them again with the new business class

15256,norwegian,6,crew seemed to be stressed,malaga to helsinkithe ground handling at malaga was polite and fast the flight was on time no word from the cockpit since airborne the cabin crew seemed to be stressed even it was their first flight of day my leather seat was torn and partially broken first flight with norwegian without any wifi or ife

1400,air china,7,one of the nicer flights,beijing to phnom penh return on an a321 the flight pushed back 10 minutes ahead of schedule this was one of the nicer flights ive experienced on a narrowbody first a few negatives this is an old style business class seat 2x2 with no seat back monitors just the overhead drop down tv which was useless despite headphones supplied safety announcements were made by one crew member reading out from her note book turning the pages swiftly and the other demonstrating however the seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room the cabin crew were just fantastic slippers were opened and handed to each passenger and informed of the flight time and seemed genuinely happy to serve hot towels were provided on boarding followed by a welcome fruit cocktail i was then offered a second drink of champagne drinks menus were handed out but no food menu it was a choice of western or chinese main course and i opted for the chinese meal i was then offered a choice of drinks from the bar a single malt whisky for me and chinese white wine to go with the food 20 minutes into the flight the bar service began dinner was served and the main fish course was very tasty i was able to taste the wine first before pouring the rest again refills followed the desert was a strange cake like thing which i was not keen on later it was coffee and cognac and more refills followed after the meal i asked if i could keep the nice red chopsticks they took the used ones away and returned with an unopened pair plus a souvenir panda gift as it was a night flight the cabin was dimmed but the crew checked on the passengers if there was anything else we wanted during the 5 hour flight despite the little recline on the seat i was able to nod off to about an hour on the return flight which also left on time a chinese breakfast was served with dim sum and congee very tasty even though the hard product was out of date the cabin crew were pleasant and engaging
8047,delta air lines,5,strictly chaotic once we got to atlanta,we arrived in atlanta from london with almost 3 hours to wait the flight was to leave at 615 in the evening but around 530 we were told that there was a weather problem and would be delayed until 7 oclock at about 655 they change the delayed time to 720 and the plane started to load and was completed by about 730 or 735 and we left the gate headed to the runway while on the runway we got ready to takeoff but then the engines were cut back and we returned to the gate they said that the weather had closed and they couldnt takeoff they also said that they had been notified that the pilots time has run out and that they would have to have new pilots so we sat on the plane for about an hour and a half until the new pilot got there they said they were having problems getting clearance to leave the gate but by the time they did surprise the attendant time had run out and now we had to wait another hour while they found new staff we finally left at about 1030 getting us home at about 1210 where we shouldve been home a little after eight i dont understand how they couldnt see the time running out coming for both the pilot and the crew well before it was the time to leave it just seems like poor management i could understand the weather problem but the pilots time running out within minutes of taking off doesnt seem to make much sense and then the attendance time runs out like nobody knew that was coming very very unhappy with that situation the flight going over to ireland and the flight back from london to atlanta was fine but strictly chaotic once we got to atlanta
12535,jetstar japan,8,seat was very comfortable,manila to nagoya with jetstar japan boarding was really quick compared to the other carriers i have flown on recently eg cebu pacific and philippine airlinespal express the plane was a brand new airbus a320 the seat was nice mainly because of the seat pocket being on top of the seat not in the leg area which of course made a lot of legroom the plane took off on schedule no ife screens this is usual for a budget carrier so i provided my own ife through my ipad soon after takeoff food and beverage service began my family and i ordered meals through their booking bundles on their website food offered was pork and beef over japanese rice the meal was really good after that they gave arrival cards for japan the seat was very comfortable to sleep and i woke up 1 hour before landing to catch the beautiful sunrise over japan a nice compliment to a early morning flight the plane landed on time and the deplaining was fast and a bus took us to the arrivals area immigration was very quick due to our flight being the first arrival of the day baggage claim was quick and we went to the airport train station to look for a train to the city
19616,taag angola airlines,6,taag angola airlines customer review,laddxb was surprised with the level of service provided on the flight following the check in at luanda the flight was pretty good departed 30 mins late and arrived early in dubai flight was not very full so plenty of space to spread out food while basic was of good standard and the drinks service was good the plane was a new b777 ife system is basic but being a late night flight didnt really use it having a basic understanding of portuguese helped but all crew spoke and understood english overall after reading previous reviews i was pleasantly surprised
19340,sunwing airlines,2,this was not the most relaxing start to our vacation,indifferent management sours the experience that old saying about one bad apple spoiling the bushel really applies to sunwing the ground and flight crews were wonderful friendly helpful good sense of humour professionaltop notch the same holds true for the indestination reps and shuttle providers all very pro and we thank you very much the sour taste in my mouth comes from management or lack thereof i purchased my travel package online and paid for it in full at the time of booking 2 days before my departure i logged in to get my edocs and was informed by automated popup message that i had a balance owing on my invoice and that my trip could be cancelled if i didnt settle my account i immediately called sunwing customer service the service rep initially argued with me until i forwarded her my confirmation email from sunwing showing the balance paid in full yes i keep everything it took one hour and fourteen minutes on hold to resolve the discrepancy perhaps they were hoping i would simply give up and pay the difference of 140 this was not the most relaxing start to our vacation once i received written confirmation of the correction i thanked the rep for her help and asked to speak to a manager the manager was on lunch so i asked for a call back 5 hours later i had still not heard back so i emailed the original rep again 2 weeks later i have still heard nothing no explanation for the arbitrary price hike no offer of compensation for my inconvenience no apology for the reps initial antagonistic attitude or for my wasted time on hold while they corrected their own error nothing i promise to update this review if i ever hear back from sunwing i dont really expect to what a sad excuse for service
15166,norse atlantic airways,8,i had a fantastic flight,i had flown norwegian long haul many times before so i had a pretty good idea what i was in for my sister and i had snagged up the flights for a deal we are good travelers no checked bags just cary ons i selected exit row seating when booking 64 and i really need that extra room and it was so worth it the plane was freezing but i noticed they were selling blankets for 5 so i think this was a tactic i am unsure why there is no wifi onboard the onboard entertainment had a decent selection with usb changer on screen i didnt use the inflight entertainment with the limitations of bluetooth headphones flying with norse again soon and i did purchase some traditional head phones so i wont struggle to download shows to my phone all in all they are a budget carrier i had a fantastic flight both too and from no food was provided thats an extra 30 but we knew this and came well prepared flight attendant was nice and was a hold over from the previous norwegian long haul if you are used to norwegian nothing about this airline should surprise you
16163,play,4,simply haughty and cold,the hostesses are simply haughty and cold ive never seen that at the checkin point at keflavik airport they dont say hello look me up and down i said hello to her twice she didnt answer me i find that unacceptable

13663,level,1,the worst treatment,major issues pre flight several months ago i booked a return flight from paris to boston on level airlines a week ago i received a notice the flight had been cancelled i contacted customer service and was told i could have a refund or they can rebook me to newark i asked about barcelona to boston and was told it was not an option the customer service rep told me i could take the rebooking and then file a claim online related to getting to boston no mention was made that if the claim was rejected i no longer would be allowed to get a refund sure enough they refused my claim and when i said id prefer a refund then i was told its too late because i took the rebooking i called customer service today and was again told i no longer have no options and staff told me we are not going to pay for you to get from newark to boston it is not our problem absolutely the worst treatment ive had from an airline they are sending myself and my 9 year old daughter to city that was not our destination and insinuated there as help options when there were not and then essentially laughed about it the cheap fares arent worth being stranded in the wrong city and insulted
16063,phuket air,5,phuket air customer review,pleased with our experience on phuket air flight out was a little dissapointing as they were old seats with little recline but we were the only two in business class so were treated like royalty the best staff i have encountered return was different much improved seating with cradle style resulting in a good nights sleep but the food wasnt quite as good i would fly phuket air business class again such a good deal
22801,wizz air,1,never fly on that airline,the airline canceled my flight from porto to milan i had another flight scheduled from milan malpensa to brindisi the next day which i also missed due to their irresponsibility i tried several times to ask for a refund of the amount paid and until today 7 months later they still havent paid never fly on that airline
20417,thomson airways,7,checkin at manchester was horrible,manchester to hurghada checkin at manchester was horrible line was massive our flight was around 1 hour delayed and was not informed about the reason although requested the flight had no ife and therefore was boring was instructed by cabin crew to fill in a form for when we arrived in egypt no pen was handed out so had to ask other passengers to borrow one which we thought was not acceptable would only fly shorter routes with tui in the future unless we were on a boeing 787
16383,qantas airways,1,worst flight experience,worst flight experience ever i am diabetic and the airline refused to offer me any drinks or food during the purchase of my ticket i asked my travel agent to make sure meal was included and i was informed halal was not an option anymore i requested to have vegetarian instead during my flight they offered meals to other passengers while i sat there with nothing to eat they did not offer me any hot drinks if the airline cant offer halal at least have vegetarian options available on the flight i hope this is taken seriously
1461,air china,5,attendants were extremely rude,beijing to washington food has improved over the last flight about a year ago last time i wont even eat the food it was so terrible aircraft had all the bells and whistles to include an iphone charging outlets the toilets were extremely dirty most of the flight attendants were extremely rude conversely others were extremely polite my final comment is that even though air china does not have control over the this airport security operations in the dark ages of all the airports ive been to this is absolutely the worst security operations there is
17202,rwandair,7,amazing cabin crew,amazing cabin crew let me just say very attentive funny and helpful very rarely do i see the cabin crew literally helping every single person to put their baggage in the overhead compartments very friendly wake up calls for food or landing very efficient with handing out meals and drinks and didnt run out of anything that i know of on the flights seats were spacious and comfy easily comparable to other bigname airlines the rwanda airport isnt impressive but does offer free wifi and it seems like all connecting flights are only there for a very short layover mine were 1 hour 19 minutes and the other 2 hours prompt boarding times and every flight we landed roughly 1030 minutes earlier then we were supposed to i dont love the flight route due to there being so many stops along the way but definitely budget friendly so cant complain over all
2382,air moldova,2,air moldova customer review,moscow chisinau rome and back i chose air moldova because of the low price and very good connections unfortunately all flights were delayed from 30 minutes to 2 hours with no apparent explanation or apologies the connection in chisinau was about 1 hour 20 minutes both times but due to delays we had to practically run to get on the next plane the chisinau airport was fine though much better for short transit that some of the other world airports the airplanes are really old i could see duct tape in several places seats are very tightly packed and also falling apart i could not recline my seat because the button fell inside the armrest inflight meal consisted of a cheese bun which was okay but not sufficient at all i have to say that wine was served which was quite good and certainly a plus crew seemed surly and disinterested although this varied from flight to flight the biggest problem is on the way back my luggage did not arrive to moscow would i fly air moldova again maybe if the price is really low it usually is but i will keep everything in my cabin luggage
12771,kenya airways,8,i had a pleasant flight,after booking my ticket i was very much afraid of all the negative reviews i have read but fortunately i had a pleasant flight both flights departure was on time luggage was received in good condition only thing that can be improved may be the food some extra items can be added
12485,jetstar asia,4,consider flying with them again,hong kong to singapore flight was operated by an a320 boarding time was supposed to start at 755pm but the aircraft didnt even arrive until 810pm boarding was fast and efficient although sitting in a window seat meant that i had to squeeze past 2 ladies to reach my seat and i really do mean squeeze the seat pitch was very narrow and the seats didnt even recline more than a few degrees suppose this is the standard for lccs once boarding was finished we couldnt push backthe pilot told us that due to traffic at hong kong airport our pushback would be delayed the scheduled departure time was 825pm but combining the late arrival of the aircraft and the heavy traffic we didnt even takeoff until 937pm in the end we arrived in singapore at 1am 1 hour behind scheduled there was no wifi or entertainment offered on board the saving grace of this flight was the cabin service during boarding the cabin service was dismal they didnt even greet the passengers and generally didnt feel very warm however after takeoff they did improve their quality of service a lotvery responsive every request was attended to quickly after landing they also apologized for the delay and the inconvenience resulted to passengers all in all although the seat was really cramped and the flight was delayed by 1 hour the saving grace was still the cabin service and given the price i might consider flying with them again
13693,level,6,a lot of work to do to,san francisco to barcelona on the positive side level has excellent prices and the food is not bad the seats even in premium economy are too hard for a long transatlantic flight so bring an inflatable cushion the return flight is painfully slow about an hour plus longer than other airlines i am guessing this is to to save fuel having stated the positive elements of level i must say it is clearly a poorly run airlines when you call the us number you are given 4 options to press but when you press option 4 other you are sent back in an unending loop in other words you cant get to option 4 if you are able to reach a recording you are then told that agents are only available up to 100 am central european time and the conversation is terminated without saying goodbye good luck trying to reserve seats early my level documents tell me that i can reserve seats early by going to an iberia web site and enter a special reference number printed on my documents unfortunately that number is not recognized by iberia after calling iberia i am told a couple of wrong information but finally i am told that it is not possible to reserve seats early so good prices food not too bad but everything else clearly indicates that management has a lot of work to do to improve the quality of their service
11311,icelandair,6,our experience will make us think twice,flew from toronto yyz to iceland connecting to finland on june 12 2023 second time flew via icelandfinland did not have the same experience experience was good before however this time we were asked to give our carryon luggage to be checked in and we were told our carryon did not meet the required measurement dont understand this carry on had been used several times during trips the latest on our caribbean cruise in april 2023 with no problem although the staff were very nice and professional and just doing her job we had to open my luggage and removed our prescription meds we were taking with us when boarded in the plane noticed 2 passengers had larger carry on bags than mine my husband and i are rule followers and we felt this airline practiced discrimination and inconsistency in enforcing rules for passengers in fact one of the passengers in the plane made a comment to a passenger why his carryon was accepted since his luggage was huge and should have been denied the passenger involved could not comment because it was not his fault his luggage was approved despite this experience we had the crew members were nice professional and accommodating but our experience will make us think twice before booking our next flight with icelandair in the future unfortunately we have to return to toronto june 23 and hope our carryon that was denied will be approved this time and we will then make future decision whether to fly with icelandair for our next trip to finland in the future
10762,gulf air,4,experience was very mediocre,flying from moscow to dubai via bahrain on 9 may back on 13 may and the experience was very mediocre the flight from mow do dubai onboard staff was impolite even rude to passengers meals were under average during a 5h flight drinks were offered only once entertainment system did not work at all seats were very uncomfortable and space between the rows smaller than usual the flight had a delay of one hour so i missed my connecting gulf air flight from bahrain to dubai when dealing with the gulf air ground personnel in bahrain chaotic incompetent talking to 34 customers at once simply a disaster they suggested me to wait at the airport in the middle of the night for 5 hours for the next flight then put me on an etihad flight to abu dhabi when i asked them to which was 1h late too btw they also issued a confirmation of the delay for me and advised to ask for an upgrade when flying back in 4 days from dubai to moscow i was unexpectedly i only found out when boarding in bahrain upgraded to the business class for the leg bahrainmoscow again the entertainment system did not work the seat was broken as the leg support did not work properly at least this one was on time i fly on average ca 20 flights a year for the last 15 years and this was certainly not the worst experience ukrainian airlines was but one of those below the average i was especially disappointed by the staff behaviour in the economic class on the leg from moscow to bahrain
17023,royal brunei airlines,9,b787 a wonderful aircraft,flew dubai to denpasar bali via brunei return refreshing cabin cabin crew friendly and great b787 is a wonderful aircraft in terms of comfort ife had sufficient content for an 810hr flight and was good in response food was superb on the shorter route i flew the new a320 very clean and fresh however lacked in ife short transit a breeze at bwn airport but not if you are entering brunei for a long transit youll have to first go to the transfer desk request a sponsor letter following which you pay 5 bruneian for transit visa hotel provided was traders inn brunei comfortable for a transit stop there seems to be some miscommunication between airline ground staff and immigration if this is sorted it would be great i have taken 8 flights in total with the airline had a great time every time

10469,go first,2,never value time for its customer,the airline never value time for its customer this time they have delayed the flight without prior intimation reaching to the boarding gate and then you come to know that 2 hour flight is delayed by 3 hours no executive present at boarding gate and you have to go back to the enquiry desk and then they tell you that it is delayed by operational reasons
5162,ba cityflyer,8,is an excellent option,enjoyable and troublefree travel on ba city flyer ive found that by making sure one has as much time as possible between flights for layovers this takes the stress out of flying these days with high aircraft utilisation the norm ive noticed that so many complaints seem to be over problems caused by missed connections due to delays caused by air traffic issues or bad weather or both the golden rule is simple never trust the short transfer and connection times between flights listed on airline web sites or suggested by some travel agents its just not worth the hassle these days even if that means staying overnight at an airport hotel for your next flight especially if that is longhaul or vv anyway i allowed many hours between my flights through london city a delightful little airport and was also able to fit in a business meeting at the airport ba city flyer flights on the smaller emb190 jet are excellent cabin crew were very attentive with my only complaint being that cheese dishes were all that were available when are airlines going to realise many of us cannot east cheese or chocolate due to the subsequent increased risk of migraine attacks my gp knows this and has for years why dont the airlines ba city flyer is an excellent option and business class fares can often be cheap and chips

4507,arik air,7,arik air customer review,i recently flew business class from london to lagos and then on to asaba i hadnt previously heard of arik usually preferring ba however the arik price was more than half the ba price and also had the guaranteed connections from lagos the business class product is impressive the beds are better than ba and the cabin feels a lot more spacious including a bar where you can go to sit the cabin crew were also very friendly the internal flights were both delayed because of the weather this was dealt with well by the arik staff though the inflight entertainment is not too good and the customer service is not quite up to the ba virgin standard i was still impressed with arik and would certainly fly with them again
10904,hawaiian airlines,1,you had to pay for everything,i missed my first flight due to their electronic check in system not working and having to wait in the customer service for an hour and a half the next day waited for 2 hours just to get our new boarding pass they tried to charge me 100 just to sit with my wife at each section in the airport they had one to two people working with up to 50 customers waiting for help once we got to the gate they were hostile and undermanned we tried asking questions about our seats and they told us to ask after they started boarding everyone once in the air they brought a food cart that you had to pay for everything then after that you could get free drinks and a sandwich no amenities whatsoever where given for free headphones blankets and real meals you had to buy they provided movies but expect you to pay for headphones or bring your own
6478,caribbean airlines,6,caribbean airlines customer review,businessfirst from jfkpos pos posgeojfk their lounges are basic flight left on time their 737800 business class is pretty standard leg room in business is just alright but considering the size of the plane acceptable food and service was good as usual fas are personable and professional it has always been my experience that ca tends to run out of popular dishes very quickly kind of sad when business class is not that big return flight on their brand new 767300er departed 90 minutes late the reason why is still a mystery to me on board nice roomy plane no complaints on leg room here the seats were nice enough they did lay flat however they did seem to go for very basic business class eg inflight entertainment was there but not usable and power at seat didnt work i ran into a really big issue with my seat tray during food service it completely fell apart and separated from the swing arm and could not be reattached it was a very full flight but fortunately there was one empty seat the fas quickly made accommodations for me overall i would say it was sufficient

11364,icelandair,5,never flying icelandair again,i lost my suitcase on my trip from the us to the netherlands and never got any compensation and the luggage was never found i couldnt provide the baggage tag because for some reason it wasnt attached to my ticket it probably fell somewhere and that i admit was my fault i went through the whole process of filing the claim sending countless pictures of what i had in the luggage the email exchanges lasted almost a month just so in the end they told me that there wont be any compensation because there is no proof that i had any luggage with me it was a 20kg suitcase and worth a lot of money so im really really disappointed never flying icelandair again

7398,condor airlines,2,most uncomfortable ive flown,economy was among the most uncomfortable ive flown in years im only 58 and there was barely enough legroom the temperature of the plane felt like 80 degrees for 11 hours the first meal was plain vegetable pasta and then the second was some sort of cheese sandwich with no alternative options they barely had enough ice if you wanted a cold drink when my mates and i wanted to order beers outside of the servicing period we were instructed to go to the back of the plane to ask and pay for it there lastly there were only two movies for in flight entertainment this is the kind of flight you want to bring your own meal and snacks on with your own entertainment setup i wont be flying them again

20896,transavia,6,standard seats had very narrow leg room,at boarding we were told that our face masks could not be used to board transavia as it had a valve design whilst it was only a design it was still not allowed and we had to get new facemasks upon boarding we were given a disinfectant tissue in a packet i noted crumbs on the seat which indicated that the plane was not cleaned prior to us boarding we were lucky enough to be seated at row 1 where we had good leg room the other standard seats had very narrow leg room we had to pay for food and drinks and the menu was similar to transavia flights prepandemic only card payments are accepted no cash overall the short flight was ok the flight was not that full and there was good social distance between passenger groups a face mask without a valve or valve design is required for flights on transavia
16742,regional express,4,regional express customer review,have flown with rex 3 times sydney albury and have a few more sectors booked small saab aircraft but that means quick boarding and disembarking relatively comfortable and flight crew very fast and efficient always with a smile although you wouldnt want to be taller than 63 im 63 to sit in their seats unless you can secure the emergency exit row a pleasure to fly with
2437,air namibia,7,air namibia customer review,sw286 in economy in mid december 2014 ive taken this flight a number of times over the past 10 years this ranked as one of the better experiences by far first and most important air namibia is now using a pair of relatively new leased airbus 330200s on this route the difference between this and the old airbus boeing 747s and md8s are striking the passenger cabin is clean relatively modern and well lit the seats have seatback entertainment systems i travel with an ipad preloaded with movies i want to watch so i cant speak to the entertainment menu itself the food was relatively bland simple but edible they serve a breakfast close to landing but its not up to much seat comfort i was in 20h on the aisle adjacent to the bathrooms seat doesnt recline but there is no electrical box under the seat in front of you in row h flight departed fra on time and arrived windhoek 15 minutes early the flight attendants were for the most part polite efficient and attentive without being fussy or cloying this works fine for me but not for everyone the flight is quite rigorously structured drinks with a hot meal are served relatively soon after takeoff the cabin lights are then turned off completely for the bulk of the flight at least 6 hours the cabin lights dont come back on until 2 hours before landing all in all good value for the money and much more comfortable than i remember in the past i remember this flight being more of an endurance ordeal than anything else ive flown sw286 on and off since 2000 and these new planes make all the difference
20067,thai airways,3,still the same old awful service,nothing changes thai airways are still awful we arrive at the airport check in through fast track as we are flying business all pretty uneventful as you would expect on a premium ticket we are flying from gate c8 and follow the signs to the thai lounge at c gates a 600m walk to find they are closed so we walk the return journey 600m back to the lounge we passed 10 15 mins before that is open at d gates we ask why we werent told by the check in staff that only the lounge at d gates is open apparently it has been shut for ages and they keep asking the check in staff to tell passengers but they dont anyone at thai airways heard of a sign simple 5 minute job by the way lovely lounge but the same awful tg service nothing changes we then get to the gate to see a queue 50m long to board no priority line for business class passengers apparently they call them on first and then it is a free for all so the business class passengers lucky enough to have made it to the lounge who dont arrive to be at the head of the queue wait in line or have to push themselves to the front embarrassing and awkward for themus nothing changes beautiful lounge tg but nothing changes still the same old awful service lack of thought and care for your passengers how can you still get it so wrong
8865,ethiopian airlines,9,overall i would recommend,the trip was nice and i think it was pretty good the food was nice and it was good since you didnt exactly need premium food there was a chocolate pudding beeffishlamb stew couscous with chickpeas or pasta some biscuits and a drink i thought it was pretty good and the flight had screens and the staff was very nice and kind my only problem was that when we landed the ethiopian and other people just pushed everyone out their way i soon figured that out also in the ethiopian airport the next day when we boarded our plane to the seychelles overall i would recommend
14979,nepal airlines,7,no entertainment system,kathmandu to mumbai flight time was 1355 in ticket to confirm i called in office and the informed that time has been changed and been 430 but it got half an hour delay thats fine flights boarding finished just in 15 minutes and we were in air in 530 pm while talking about the legroom it was very good a320 was new and cabin looked good they served beer or cold drinks with the dinner food was good never expected that from nepal airlines it needs more improvement there was no entertainment system just screen above our head that showed flight status i took my own entertainment system otherwise flight was smooth
23023,xl airways france,3,the aircraft was dirty,paris to san francisco the aircraft was dirty thetable was broken on my girlfriends seat no inseat entertainment on long haul flights so be prepared to have a tablet or other form of screen support otherwise you can rent an ipad from the airline however make sure you ask for one as you sit down since they dont have enough for everyone the inbound flight was just as dirty this time no ipads to rent as none had been charged up from previous flight my seat was broken in the recline position and the armrests were broken
16863,royal air maroc,9,actually a great experience,overall the experience wasnt bad party of 3 adults actually booked on 2 separate reservations check in at miami was easy we did the 24 hr layover to experience casablanca which was the whole reason we chose the airline we had confusion initially on if we would get our bags in cmn the third person in our party had a late connection into miami and her luggage said it was checked to cmn ours was checked to bcn however her bag did not show up in cmn staff was nice and willing to help but their customer service was what i found to be typical for the country just lacking by american standards plane was clean food was good the flight itself was actually a great experience better than most us airlines
4294,american eagle,4,not be using this airline again,nashville to chicago my initial flight was an hour and a half late no reason for the delay was given i ran through the airport to catch my connecting flight and they refused to let me board with 10 minutes to spare the plane was still stationary and attached to the gate 25 minutes later i asked them the soonest they could get me a flight to my destination and they replied curtly 4 pm tomorrow thats all we can do they had me in tears will not be using this airline again
8977,etihad airways,2,flight was disappointing,i was very disappointed and uncomfortable with how etihad airways was treating me on a 6 hour flight from abu dhabi to brussels on december 15th this was one of the worst overnight flights i have ever experienced in economy class the inflight entertainment system was very poor and was glitching i expected the flight to be good but it was horrible the flight was disappointing the airline needs to upgrade their services next time i will never choose etihad airways for travel
2390,air moldova,5,air moldova customer review,vie to kiv the experience was quite odd like going back into the soviet days as they were using a yak40 on the flight staff friendly and relatively professional although it felt almost like a charter flight the meal was quite good and flight was on time the cabin layout was really bizarre with something looking like a couch near the front of the plane and little leg room in my seat the fact that they didnt deice the plane it was snowing hard at takeoff freaked me out a bit too not sure if theyre still using the yak40 but if you happen to get on this one its certainly a unique experience if youre up for it
14290,lynx air,4,utter disorganization was on full display,our expectations of this airline were low expecting a low frills experience not only were our low expectations not met but their utter disorganization was on full display our story echoes others in that we arrived suitably early for our flights both to and from our destination only for us to find hours long delays in boarding their claims of weather delays lacked credibility and after i advised their counter staff of their obligation to provide updates every 30 minutes did they start sharing info i dont recommend buying tickets too far into the future
11465,insel air,8,insel air customer review,i have flow curacaovalencia valenciacuracao several times i dont have much to complain about the flights usually didnt have delays and most of the delays were at valencia where local authorities decided to increase security at the airport causing delays in flights aircrafts look old md82 but they are comfortable and clean and the crew are friendly we didnt have food or drinks inflight i suppose its because the cur val route is only a 30 min flight you spend most of that time filling the venezuelan immigration papers
13158,kuwait airways,7,experience was very good,kuwait to kochi the aircraft was not too old or may be a new one the flight departed on time from the kuwait airways dedicated new terminal no 4 cabin crew was very attentive food beverage good in business class the seat was not flat bed overall flight experience was very good but the ground services was very poor
631,afriqiyah airways,6,afriqiyah airways customer review,gatwick to joburg troubles just beginning to brew in libya the start seemed off putting when i noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from tripoli to joburg which the booking office could not explain also when i was not on the reservations list at checkin however the latter was sorted without hassle service on flight to tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good however we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in arabic onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean we were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft the three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding once again food and service fine there was a refuelling stop at kinshasa during my week in s africa the revolution in libya took off i expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier however when i contacted afriqiyah in joburg they said i was rebooked on egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking they sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly the afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them on the basis of value for money afriqiyah is excellent but be prepared for a journey with a difference
9362,fiji airways,8,service was friendly and efficient,sydney to los angeles with a stopover in nadi check in was easy with no waiting aircraft left a few minutes late due to normal sydney delays nadi is nearing a make over and no doubt the new lounge will be superior to the old one which is still usable flight from nadi left on time i slept most of the way to lax and the plane landed ahead of time food offered was of a good standard and the service was friendly and efficient the stop in nadi does break up the flight and the new look airport will be a big boost a good flight all over the ife is limited however there where decent choices
3964,alitalia,2,not fly alitalia again,barcelona to istanbul via rome check in was appalling a customer service staff was so rude that a colleague of his came to my assistance i could not remove my old airline tag from my check in luggage his reply was that it was my problem wouldnt even help me after asking him several times informing him that i couldnt remove it he refused to check in my luggage then his colleague ignored him helped out i will not fly alitalia again
8764,emirates,6,think i would try another airline,a very cramped journey from bali to dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and i am only 5 ft 2 the pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely with just a 1 hour transit in dubai i hopped onto the a380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall the air hostess on this flight were not as friendly a particular air hostess kept telling me off because i crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle i mean we were so squished i fell asleep and they didnt serve me the first meal or even offer a drink when i woke up they just past me as if i didnt exist the second meal was an excellent portion size the food could barely fit on the tray i particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola and cheese and biscuits for the hot food it wasnt impressive i had better food on cheaper airlines the air hostess were ok about re filling my water bottle all in all i think i would try another airline for this long journey next time just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above
2135,air malta,4,extra legroom reservation was not respected,aircraft changes are normal these days flight experience ok nothing to say against it industry standard seat pitch inflight food and drinks very good fare but my emergency extra legroom reservation was not respected only the seat number i was asked if i have reserved 13d but they did not mention that this is no emergency row anymore so losing three of my points beside the badly trained checkin staff i do not understand why an airline with one airplane type is giving to some few planes other row numbers for emergency rows when selling them for higher fees
20659,tigerair australia,6,punctual with no delays,brisbane to melbourne the flight back to melbourne was an evening flight this was great as i had technically had a whole day to travel around before heading home the flight was punctual with no delays i didnt have any gripes or anything significantly negative although i would at the very least of liked a window or aisle seat instead of being squished in the middle tigerair doesnt have inflight entertainment inflight wifi or complimentary meals however since it was bang on 2 hours i dont need inflight entertainment or wifi for this short of a trip neither a complimentary meal cabin crew were attentive and there is the option to purchase food and beverages on their flights
8654,ellinair,2,items stolen during baggage handling,heraklion to athens we bought the online ticket because it included hold baggage in the price and appeared to be the most reasonable we checked in very easily as there was no one at the checkin desk we had our bags tagged and sent on the conveyor belt at 10am alls good we had a quick flight to athens all on time within 15 minutes of arriving at athens we were able to pick up our bags off the carousel took them to the taxi less than an hour later we checked in our athens plaka hotel my husband went to open his bag and to his dismay he found the toggle openers of his osprey pack had 5 out of the 6 missing off his zips making it virtually impossible to open i immediately emailed ellinair they responded and said a complaints department would contact us they did but because we hadnt notified the people at the airport they couldnt do anything about it well we didnt notice the missing handles at that point anyway since then we have realised that the bag had been opened and new gloves had been stolen for this reason we wouldnt go near ellinair or heraklion airport ever again the most reasonable ticket has ended up costing us a lot more than we bargained for we are incensed that there are staff who are dishonest and clearly not enough checks are done when employing people there should be cctv in place in the baggage handling area so they can be checked as im sure we are not the first or the last to have items stolen during baggage handling
7748,csa czech airlines,9,i was very pleasantly surprised,prague to rome i didnt expect a lot when booking a flight with czech airlines but i was very pleasantly surprised the plane was a smartwings one the interior wasnt new but was clean and working well the flight was on time there was also an inflight wifi which worked well crew was polite nice and attentive only water was given for free but thats normal nowadays however czech airlines offer so called gourmet menu for 14 which must be purchased online at least one day before takeoff for that 14 you get a tasty hot meal served on porcelain dessert salad fresh buns with butter and three drinks including winebeer and hot drinks served in glass or porcelain cups all that with maximum willingness and professionalism to conclude give this airline with almost 100 years of tradition a chance they struggled in recent past but now they are a nice option for flying to prague or via prague again
923,air astana,1,highly recommend air astana,bangkok to almaty return first time flying with air astana and was incredibly impressed the service from ticketing check in to on board was exceptional travelling with a baby can often be tiring and stressful however they accommodated our needs every step of the way on return we had a quick transfer in bkk to another airline air astana staff were able check our luggage right through to the final destination tagged it to ensure ground crew knew of the urgency all went very smoothly and we made connections with zero fuss and our bags arrived first on carousel i highly recommend air astana and look forward to flying them again
4782,austrian airlines,3,forced to check in my trolley,i was forced to check in my trolley at the gate in vienna there was lots of space on the aircraft i could have put my board trolley under the seat in front of me but they said its too heavy avoid austrian if you can as well as vienna airport
2529,air new zealand,1,needs better trained staff,the worst airline in the whole world majority of the staff i work with are unprofessional under trained and rude as hell they dont even bother helping you when you need it and i had this problem on the way to hawaii and on the way back home prior to my flight back home i paid 120 to check in an extra bag got to the airport checked in only at the gate they told me that one of my bags wasnt loaded onto the plane as i never paid for it i showed them proof of payment and then only they loaded it why wasnt this done at check in oh i know why i was attended by a new employee who kept giving me death stares and talked as soft as a mouse half my time wasted was me asking him to repeat himself he also made me pay double money for my visa as he gave me the wrong information the first time seriously this airline needs better trained staff
12038,jet airways,4,no jet airways again,mumbai to bangalore on 28th nov 235 pm flight as i was relocating to a new place required to carry extra luggagethey charged me hefty amount for my extra luggage weight and even a charge for an extra piece of baggage earlier it was 25kg which has reduced to 15kg food and services have too gone down though in the flight i realized many seats were empty they could have easily waived the charge no jet airways again
15330,okay airways,6,okay airways customer review,xian ma60 on jmuhrb is much better alternative than train or bus cabin reasonable for regional flights we got a bottle of mineral water which was put on every seat the only flight attendant was hidden for a 50 minutes long flight
15691,openskies,6,openskies customer review,ewrory return flight out was very efficient and ewr lounge was uncrowded outgoing flight to paris was served by french staff who were very attentive this contrasted sharply with the flight back orly check in was disorganized testing a new system with passengers as guinea pigs 45 min line for check in this was followed by a dark overcrowded lounge with indifferent staff when i inquired about wifi i was informed it hadnt worked in over a month and there were no expectations for future improvement orly lounge staff also failed to inform about a late change in gate assignment resulting in a delay in loading passengers the american staff on return seemed indifferent and a bit dour flight time was good and inclined seats are still at a bargain price but it would be so much better with an upgrade in attitude and simple service onboard and in orly lounge
16735,regional express,5,regional express customer review,adelaide to port lincoln return inflight service is the best service includes choice of coffee tea wine or champagne light snack muffin or savory snacks
9290,fiji airways,5,fiji airways was ok,fiji airways was ok service is not great and they run out of the meal options early in the servicing they also seemed to dawdle them have to always rush at the end of the flight to feed everyone planes are a bit old so i guess if youre paying full price its worth going elsewhere on this route
17203,rwandair,9,cabin crew were attentive,dubai to libreville via kigali was comfortable with flight as cabin crew were attentive and available clean and arranged flights all the way through didnt enjoy transfer at kigali however as airport was not as organized as flight
11855,japan airlines,6,on board wifi is awful,tokyo to melbourne on the good side excellent seat lies properly flat and gives great privacy for business class big screen tv and the supplied mattress topper is a nice touch so comfortable the on board wifi is awful very slow and drops out on the way up i couldnt get it to connect at all but i was charged twice on the way home there have been service issues i ordered a meal 45 mins later i didnt have it i had to go forward and ask again they apologised then it came twice when finished i waited for the tray to be collected as that didnt happen i pressed the call bell no one came its a pity about the service good seat nice clean plane just service thats not good enough for business class prices
2040,air koryo,6,air koryo customer review,a timewarp experience to say the least my flight from beijing to pyongyang was without hitch although youd be hard pressed to find a team less interested in not only the well being but the safety of the passengers for example when the purser was meant to make the safety announcement she looked around and saw a flight full of foreigners as a result she actually shrugged rolled her eyes and sat right back down instead of briefing us that it was a 30 year old tupolev made that nagging feeling of i should probably listen to the safety announcement in case i jinx the flight all the more pressing that said the flight was a dream the plane felt so heavy we barely realised we were touching down the food was passable but the experience was unforgettable our seats tilted forwards rather than backwards but for a 2 hour flight the sense of wonder far outweighs any actual discomfort the stewardesses seemed more interested in reapplying thick strata of foundation and redoing their 60s overdone hairstyles than actually serving their passengers but the sight was certainly more entertaining than the sad slightly desperate propaganda movies played throughout the flight my air koryo flight was a tremendous start to my trip
17747,scoot,4,seat had hardly any cushion,this is a no frills airline the seat had hardly any cushion and my body could feel the seat metal frame on a 4 hours flight
13725,liat,9,i was very pleasantly surprised,trinidad to barbados i was planning a long weekend with friends in trinidad i live mostly in barbados but also in london uk id been umming and aahhing between liat and caribbean airlines and i checked out the reviews for liat which are definitely not good i regularly fly between barbados and jamaica via caribbean airlines which involves a stoptransit through trinidad and my transit experiences have not been good delays cancellations etc one time arriving in barbados at around 300am instead of the scheduled 945m and anyone who knows piarco airport would agree that it has to be the most soulless airport ever no information is given few places to eat get a coffee etc piarco departure lounge is brutal in the end i decided on caribbean airlines for my outward bound flight and liat for my return i rationalised that if the ca flight due to depart at around 845 was late i could spend hours there whereas if i took the afternoon liat fight even with cancellations that i stood a reasonably good chance of arriving in barbados before midnight as it happens luck seemed to have been on my side liat reviews are full of tales of delays cancellations rude staff wtc im happy to say that this was not my experience the flight departed 5 minutes later than its scheduled 235 pm time slot which in aviationairline term is not at all late and got me into barbados within the hour all staff were pleasant and helpful as needed we were served a beverage which ca did not offer on the outward bound journey flight was pleasant seats were reasonably comfortable pilotcaptain kept us informed and i really liked their inflight magazine overall i was very pleasantly surprised because as i said liat has very poor reviews and everyone that i had consulted prior to booking had warned me off liat as i say i may just have been very fortunate but for this flight at least everything went well and if liat could maintain this standard i would happily fly liat again even though im a confirmed ca fan
6504,carpatair,3,carpatair customer review,veronatimisoarachisinau the flight from verona departed almost 5 hours late resulting in 45 hours late arrival at the final destination the company didnt provide sufficient information as to the causes of delay voucher provided for food and drinks doesnt get you much in verona airport i should commend them for holding the flight timisoarachisinau on the tarmac until a number of connecting passengers flying from all over italy made it to timisoara onboard the service was good offered hot meal alcoholic drinks and good attitude from flight attendants despite the stress and extended working hours caused by the delay service on the timisoarachisinau leg also good overall three stars two stars for handling the delay and 4 stars for service attitude and the fact that they did get us to the final destination on the same day despite a long delay
18114,silkair,5,silkair customer review,the outbound flight from cok was on time and the crew were tolerant to us even though we were a bit late to get to the gate the crew were friendly and the food was okay had ordered an avml meal the boeing sky interior was fantastic the leg space was a bit small im around 6 foot and i was cramped the crew were friendly and pleasant the toilet was clean too however i cant believe that they have no personal ife screens and no headphones were provided either i spent the 4 hour journey reading and sleeping the inbound flight was pretty much the same as the the outbound but the seats were quite worn out the worst thing was the food
20016,thai airways,3,poor customer service,poor customer service not preferable if you are travelling along with your family cabin crew not providing first preference to family who are travelling along with kid
16175,play,9,roomy seats for most of the flights,wonderful service roomy seats for most of the flights love the flight attendants outfits it would be helpful to at least offer water for free and a way to plug in our phones wifi would be helpful
13487,lao airlines,9,lao skyway customer review,siem reap to pakse very happy with this flight we were not sure what to expect but the plane atr72 500 was very clean with new upholstery and plenty of leg room not that leg room was an issue with only 16 people on board the flight is 40 minutes and was on time a free snack was served shortly after takeoff and a bottle of water which was good given the flight duration was so short
5148,ba cityflyer,6,such a disappointing experience,having previously lived close to london city airport it was my airline of choice for european routes having moved to canada it was my first ba cityflyer flight in about 5 years biz class from berlin to lcy was a real let down my partner and i were moved from 1cd due to the galley configuration to 4ab and then on the day we were split between 3a and 4a i presume this was to accommodate a gold card flier who refused to change seats when i asked on board with a flight deck and cabin crew dead heading back to city the cabin service unfortunately took a nose dive after take off the two pilots were served by row number and before row 4 leaving pax with a choice or sandwiches or sandwiches after the meal and a drink tcs the curtain was closed with 4 crew behind the curtain no more drinks and glass only collected as we started descent into lcy with basically no service for the last 30 mins or so id still use ba cityflyer for the convenience and comfort better leg room but dead heading crew should know better than to distract the purser at the front whilst the purser should remember who the customers are she was meant to be looking after such a disappointing experience
2343,air memphis,5,air memphis customer review,weve made a return flight paris marsa alam on an a320 i have to say that crew were all very kind playing with children smiling its quite rare to see warm food in a charter flight even though the food was forgettable seats seem to be refurbished mine during the first flight was broken and i was always on recline position even during takeoff return flight an a320 with no sign on the tail the space for legs was a shame
16566,qatar airways,6,switched us from suites,qatar is usually very good but watch out they switched us from suites to a very old not so comfortable business class of a very dated design no apologies just you get what you get no room for anything skimpy travel kit didnt have a toothbrush not what you expect from an airline that claims to be best business class
16616,qatar airways,5,not responsible for the compensation,our tickets from jfk to mle were changed from jan 31 to feb 1 2023 luckily i found out before the flight date on the day of the flight the flight was delayed for more than 3 hours and we missed the connection from doh to mle qatar airways said they are not responsible for the compensation extremely disappointing we flew 4 times with the airline the flights were all smooth
1309,air canada rouge,1,outstanding customer service,i would like to express my gratitude for some outstanding customer service i experienced from ground crew from las vegas to vancouver i am an 80 plusyearold lady that was not looking forward to all of the walking and stress of going through customs when we reached vancouver i was blown away with the attentive ground staff that whisked me through customs and made it so enjoyable and so stressfree thank you so much for your assistance happy thanksgiving to you all
18824,southwest airlines,1,doing a great job despite the circumstances,stellar employees at southwest ground crew attendants pilots etc true dedication to their work and doing their best during these challenging times our flight was delayed multiple times during that time i was able to do some research as to what was going on due to severe storm activity across the country many airlines had to cancel flights southwest included i understand people being upset but what i appreciate is southwests ongoing communication to let their passengers know ahead of time that the airline and flights were experiencing irregular operations they clearly assure their passengers ahead of time if your flight was canceled and you would like a refund please submit a request so i went fully knowing my flight could be cancelled of course multiple delays the ground crew communicated with us multiple times telling us they were doing what they could that something had happened to their network could have it been hacked or challenges with having to cancel flights due to storm activity regardless this airline wouldnt have cancelled if they felt the airways were safe or they had the capacity then to our amazement they were able to organize the crew offline and get us on our flight home these are trying times shutdowns due to mysterious viruses freaky weather some things cant always be controlled or predicted but the response is what matters southwest is doing a great job despite the circumstances and i will continue to fly with this airline
4651,asiana airlines,7,staff were superb,new york to bangkok via seoul both sections were on a380 first the good news planes were immaculately clean staff were superb throughout food was great on first leg not so good on bkk section both planes were delayed we had received notification that the jfk to icn flight times had changed about one hour later departure but we left about another one after this this it appears that oz221 is always late leaving jfk its not the airport issue as the ke a380 seems to leave on time every day around the same time connection at icn was tight but the plane was delayed once we had boarded food option poor only two choices on icn to bkk no korean option movie choice on icn to bkk poor only 4 hollywood movies the price was keen and would use again
22975,xiamen airlines,9,nice regional wings for asia pacific,was flying from hangzhou to tianjin on xiamen air hgh was very foggy and the plane took off 2 hours late during the wait in the aircraft the crew provided me with coffee as i requested and after take off to a bad weather we were experiencing turbulence 70 of the 2 hour flight but the crew were very professional in serving and food and beverages xiamen airline is a nice regional wings for asia pacific
4302,american eagle,2,2marked decline in reliability,college station to washington via dallas i have flown out of college station for six years i have noticed a marked decline in the reliability and ontime performance of the american eagle flights in the past year or so i have flown four times in the past couple of months and each time the flight was delayed at least an hour today i scheduled a connection with an extra hour of connection time but it is not enough i am going to miss the connection i fly internationally quite often and have given up trying to fly american eagle for those trips because missing the connection is not something you can recover from the thing i hate the most is the way they say delayed 20 minutes then delayed an hour then delayed an hour and 10 minutes then delayed two hours etc if the delay were at least estimated with a little more accuracy then a person could make plans the problem is that the planes are so ancient that there are constant maintenance problems this airline like nearly all us carriers is a mess it is just terrible if i had any choice at all about travel i would not fly american airlines but in my town there are very limited options unfortunately american eagle does not give a darn about its quality of service the ground crew in cll just shrugs their shoulders not their fault
6564,cathay dragon,7,entertainment has a lot of choices,before you step into the cabin they offer 3 choices of the newspaper two in chinese and one in english when you step into the cabin the first impression of this flight is the uniform of the flight attendant the old one looks more stylish and professional the latest one looks childish on the upside you can expect a warm smile and a clear instruction where your seat from ka crew the leg room of my seat is ok consider i am just 170cm tall for entertainment i must say there is a lot of choices most of the movies are just being shown lately and other than the movie you can find some latest tv series as well as the documentary show of course there are games to play speaking of the catering i am not much into the food but compared to other hong kong base carrier ka offer more choice and better quality i mean who doesnt like haagen daz ice cream
13600,laudamotion,1,not to press the service button,dusseldorf to alicante two and a half hours late due to late incoming aircraft excuse but then we had to stand for at least three minutes in the rain on the steps to the aircraft i ordered coffee and snacks for my group and when i tried to pay by credit card was told the the machine didnt work could have told me before i ordered no milk and sugar was given i like it black and bitter anyway but the rest of the group asked for some my coffee was only half full and after waiting five minutes i pressed the service button and asked for it to be filled it was and i was told not to press the service button again unless it was an emergency i never heard that before the milk and sugar for the rest of the group never came
15959,philippine airlines,4,suggest to review your systems,the flight was scheduled to depart at 150 pm and it actually departed after 2 hours 50 minutes ie at 440 pm it landed at manila at 550 pm but we were stuck on tarmac on the pretext of lightning alert when other flights were commuting we finally got down after 35 mins waiting in the plane after that we had to wait for luggage which was announced at belt no4 but arrived at belt no5 no assistance from staff no clarity on issues everything being done at very slow pace would suggest to review your systems fortunately i didnt book connecting flight to india on the same day otherwise would have missed the same
17827,shaheen air,8,shaheen air customer review,flight from karachi to islamabad plane 737800 flight was pleasant and no turbulence during the whole flight enough leg space to stretch your legs as being a domestic flight there wasnt any entertainment available but the food was excellent even though the airline is cheaper than other airlines in terms of service and satisfaction it has an edge over its competitors
14589,malindo air,1,no proactive update,johor bahru to subang flight retimed with original schedule at 1810 hours to 1910 hours and now 2100 hours god knows if we are taking off at 2100 or later no staff can be seen at the gate to provide proactive update other airlines are flying without delay malindo is far away from being close to a low cost airline service standard
2549,air new zealand,2,doing us a favour by showing up,boarding was due to start 810 flight time 840 the captain strolled in to airport gate around 850 unapologetic and acting like doing us a favour by showing up

20309,thomas cook airlines,4,crammed in like sardines,bristol to larnaca a320 of smartlynx airlines painted in thomas cook colours 2 hours late leaving bristol the luggage was on board but apparently the computer had deleted it off the system the luggage had to be unloaded and matched up to the passengers then loaded again seat the most uncomfortable i have ever sat in crammed in like sardines no hot water on the flight so no tea or coffee also ran out of ice halfway through the trip cabin crew were very pleasant but oddly had a rest break halfway through the flight i will not fly on this airline again if i can help it
8660,ellinair,3,staff were friendly,flew ellinair from thessaloniki to cologne booking process and space on the plane were unacceptable staff were friendly propably the only aspect which could be reviewed as good the airline is not following european standards and is charging extreme prices for this poor service
19186,sriwijaya air,7,sriwijaya air customer review,flight from batam to padang the checkin counter was so slow they should provide online checkin which will make it easier for those who doesnt need to drop luggage checkin staff were not polite and dont speak english but inside the cabin the fas were good and smiled they still gave out a snack and drink on such a low cost price

280,aer lingus,2,stranded in europe for another day,on the way to the uk the flight the tvs in the headrests were nonfunctioning the way back was where the pain comes from however got a subtle little text at 4 am of the morning of my flight that my flight home had been canceled their website was non functional and i couldnt call their customer support because after waiting for an hour on hold they hung up on me i got to gatwick airport and there were no aer lingus employees some poor man from gatwick was handling an entire flight of people who had been cancelled not rebooked and shunned by the company after calling the customer service again i was able to reach someone who reluctantly helped me change the bookings however due to their screw up i could not make their connecting flight back to the states they refused to give me a voucher for another airline and informed me that there was nothing they could do and i would be stranded in europe for another day at least when i finally did get to board my flight to dublin from london they only released the gate location 15 minutes before takeoff when i arrived at the gate we waited for another 30 minutes as the plane had yet to taxi to the gate once finally through the boarding pass check we were herded into the loading area only to have to stand there cramped like sardines as they informed us that refueling had to happen and now we must stand in the boarding area
211,aer lingus,7,would certainly use them again,our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 june for our return flight i have one big issue and some niggles for the whole flight the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets there was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is in my view unacceptable the seat on the a330 is comfortable and i had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep i have ever had in the air the food offering was for me poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service it comprised a pack of five mini savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer on the outbound flight we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight the asianstyle beef at dinner had little of the orient about it i didnt try the dessert or either of the starters ife was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers finally the complimentary wifi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding okay quite a bit of whinging there and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early i would certainly use them again for this route though as too few manchester to the usa options are available
21719,vietnam airlines,6,seats which are fully flat,paris to singapore via hanoi the queue to check in at the paris cdg sky priority counter was the longest wequeue as business class passengers air france lounge at 2e was pretty good with chicken fish as hot dishes paris to hanoi was in a a350 with 121 reverse herringbone seats which are fully flat food onboard with good french standards fas helpful and proactive on this sector stopover in hanoi was about 2 hours though the lotus lounge was spacious modern and bright the only edible food to us was the hot chicken noodle soup the greatest disappointment from hanoi to singapore was in an older a321 plane with 22 angled seats this last sector of about 3 hours we could not rest well due to the old poor business class seats there was no amenities like eye shades ear plugs nor slippers for business class on this sector so you should keep your slippers from the earlier a350 flights overall we arrive about 30 mins earlier than scheduled and all luggage arrived safely hence if their rates are attractive enough worth a go

1450,air china,3,pay more to fly lufthansa or ana,tokyo to paris via shanghai i expected the same budget experience like on the journey to tokyo but it went worse the ground experience at nrt was excellent quick checkin security and passport controls great ana lounge priority boarding for star alliance gold members greetings while boarding was not particularly friendly and so was the service also on the flight to pvg the food was more than ok for this 2h30 flight the real odyssee began at shanghai airport there was no visible sign for international transfers so i asked my way and was told to go first to the fingerprints collection and then to the regular immigration line when it was my turn the customs officer told me to fill in a blue form for long layover without visa after a while there were more and more people to paris asked to do so but then someone told us that its not necessary and we were asked to follow her up to the well hidden international transfer counter where we waited about 2030 minutes we were around 25 passengers to paris waiting there until someone came to exchange our boarding passes against new ones why then all of us had to go back to the immigration counters to get their boarding passes stamped before going back to the international transfer counter again for our boarding passes and passports getting checked once again after that we still had to go through the long lines of security control the whole procedure took over 2 hours there should have been trained air china staff to help customers and the airport staff should known the process of international to international transfers and give the right information if you book international to international you should count on 3 hours transit to be on the safe side our aircraft to paris was on an apron position and we had to take a crowded bus chaotic to board a large plane with only one stairway fa were not particularly friendly but the service was quick and ok for a budget airline the seats were also ok and the entertainment sytem also we arrived slightly delayed in paris i wrote them a friendly email to complain about the disastrous transfer in pvg and i received a short answer 3 lines in very poor english not really giving the impression they care about frequent flyers and star alliance gold members the ticket was cheap and for a very cheap price i would fly them again but only for a direct flight to china not with an international transfer for a flight to tokyo again i would pay 200300 more to fly lufthansa or ana much better service inflight and on the ground and much better customer service
2893,air tahiti nui,5,cabin staff did an ok job,the airplane was almost new and was in good condition departed and arrived on time no problems with the checked bags the seat back was a bit on the thin side the new slim seat design seat back video screen worked fine but the selection of movies tv programs etc was rather limited but ok for a night flight food was good but not outstanding and it was served quickly after departure checkin at ppt started only about 3 hr before departure cabin staff did an ok job but were not outstanding as the plane departed at midnight most people wanted to go to sleep rather than anything else overall the flight was as good as or slightly better than flights offered by united airlines
3086,air transat,7,outrageous customer service,we booked for a 3 week vacation after 6 days at resort we received an email telling us we had to come home at the end of 2 weeks with a full refund for 1 week hotel accommodation credited to our credit card several emails and phone calls and no response to either myself or my travel agent we have been home for 10 weeks outrageous customer service right now not certain will use again especially after they changed our departure airport from london to toronto and only offer take it or leave it offer cost us extra money for hotel and food both for departure and arrival plus hour drive both ways and we are seniors
9381,fiji airways,3,not one smile,flew fiji airways from nadi to melbourne the flight itself was comfortable the care by staff was another story terrible would be an understatement not one smile by the attendants gave a duty free order promptly which was ignored food tray left on lap for 2 hours passenger had a small child that was sick and help button pressed which was ignored so friend had to run down to the back of plane to get help but came back without it until a few minutes later a bottle of water and a cup was all that was offered no attempt made to help except to say might have to get border control in poor woman was trying to clean up and help upset child the staff came up the aisle so infrequently we didnt know who they were really upset me this flight as most of the fijian people are helpful and obliging
19598,taag angola airlines,2,a low standard airline,cape town to porto return via luanda of the four flights we were on this airline for our trip from cape town to porto the inflight entertainment was broken on three the staff could hardly speak or understand english the ambient temperature was either too hot on one flight or too cold on another onboard catering took excruciatingly long to get going overall a low standard airline a huge pity because if the airline realised the potentially huge market they have on this route theyd improve their standards without question
13574,latam airlines,2,will be avoiding,flying as a family of 4 we purchased tickets from lima to buenos aires with a short layover in santiago leaving on 15th december latam changed our flight times repeatedly changing both the date of departure and the arrival airport leaving us with a 10 hour layover from the early hours which we had to endure sleepless and uncomfortable in santiago we were told we could change the flights if we werent happy but there were none available latam were not interested in the fact they had changed the date of travel had added a long overnight layover in spite of the fact we had originally paid extra to avoid that we were all exhausted upon arrival plus the usual inedible flight food and i will be avoiding this airline in future
13564,latam airlines,2,unwelcome as a customer,as with all latam flights so far no onboard service despite premium economy no lounge for domestic flights delays and the feeling of being completely unwelcome as a customer
6465,caribbean airlines,2,caribbean airlines customer review,bw 903 on 09072014 from london gatwick to trinidad i usually have a good experience when flying with caribbean airlines however the bw903 had a couple of unprofessional flight attendants they were rude had no sympathy for passengers with children this together with a generally poor service made it a difficult flight

18572,smartwings,2,gave me and my wife separated seats,we had a flight from teneriffe to tel aviv through prague with smartwings for some reason we werent able to checkin online but it was ok what isnt ok is that you cant get tickets to all your connecting flights at the first airport and you need to checkin again at the connecting airports we had short connection times 40 minutes more than enough according to smartwings staff so we ran to the transfer checkin area which was closed and the passport control told us to leave the transfer terminal just before the exit someone from our flight stopped us and told us that someone was waiting for us near the flight exit then this guy gave me and my wife separated seats and told us that there were no seats left i saw people who were getting their tickets after us and were sitting together it was the worst flying experience that i have had it is not low cost
2462,air namibia,1,air namibia customer review,checking in at 0600 in cape town along with my husband and 20 month old baby for our flight back to whk at 0800 we were casually informed that our plane was inserviceble and would hopefully be ready for departure at 1000 needless to say that did not happen and we departed at 1800 that evening without much of an explanation or apology my husband dared his next venture with air namibia on 21 march and was casually informed 5hours before his flight that it was cancelled but had been rebooked on a sal flight to be booked in within 2 hours which turned out not to be true after confirming the booking with sal ourselves we live 500km away from whk and cannot be on standby to be ready for their flight changes as it suits them we have always been regular travelers with air namibia but unfortunately it seems not to be safe anymore to rely on their unserviceable planes or their inconsiderate service
2450,air namibia,8,air namibia customer review,i flew on 18052013 from cape town to windhoek and back on 26052013 was very surprised with the excellent service and overall great flying experience the food was very good and although the tickets are a bit expensive for a 2 hour flight i still feel i got value for my money the only thing air namibia should improve on is their inflight entertainment
5519,batik air,6,the food was horrible,semarang to jakarta batik air have ife on most of their fleet which was good and the screen was responsive the fa were okay although not as nice as the other indonesian full service airline they arent as rude as lion or wings in the same group the food was horrible i know it was hust a short flight i got a piece of strawberry jam filled bread and a mineral water no additional drink that we can choose the seat pitch was really good
7255,cityjet,7,cityjet customer review,london cityflorence return usual swift checkin at lcy halffull avro rj85 took off on time interior slightly worn but clean and seats comfortable with just about enough leg room im 183 for the 2hr flight staff professional handed out drinks and sandwiches which were adequate but which could perhaps be upgraded slightly from slightly skimpy cheese or tuna mayonnaise the basket of complimentary belgan chocolate squares passed round later is a nice touch though return flight checkin handled by air france at florence for some reason af staff insisted that queuing passengers should print out their boarding cards from automated checkins before dropping baggage flight similarly smooth although delayed by about 20 minutes due to late incoming aircraft for which captain apologised cabin crew made a second sandwich run offering more to anyone who wanted them overall good flights that were less expensive and better quality than those offered by meridiana the airline we have previously used for londonflorence trips
11001,hong kong airlines,7,very good solid service,hong kong to beijing a very good solid service the food is not ideal but satisfying in flight entertainment was not working but was advised of this at check in the boarding procedure was fast and the captain made adequate announcements keeping us informed at all times the seat has a good recline pitch and is quite comfortable for the short trip
13428,lao airlines,5,no space at all,savannakhet to bangkok via pakse lao airlines is lovely unfortunately the seat pitch leave you with no space at all if i ever have to sit next to someone on a flight i will simply not fit into my designated space if the seat in front of me decline their seat im in real trouble they should really fix the seat pitch aside from that lao airlines is great
15178,norse atlantic airways,4,no phone service or online chat,the planes are nice but a little cramped for taller passengers like me the staff were lovely too the prices seem good to start with but then you realise that everything is extra i guess its standard fare for a budget airline by the time youve added luggage food etc you might as well go for a better airline even checking in online is extra which means that if you dont want to pay you have to queue even if you have no hold luggage i also tried to change the names on some of my tickets but the cost to do this was nearly the same amount as the original tickets so pointless basically same story to change the dates if youre looking for flexibility then norse are not for you i cancelled some tickets in the end thinking at least id get some airport tax back but by the time norse had taken their admin fees off of this it amounted to barely anything im still waiting for this a week later too my main bugbear with norse is their communication there is no phone service or even online chat for problemsqueries you need to raise a ticket online and if youre lucky they will get back to you in a day or 2 this starts an email thread where questions are answered by a slew of different people sometimes giving conflicting or unclear information so frustrating as some of my enquiries could have been answered in minutes rather than the 34 days that it actually took
1665,air france,3,hung us out to dry due to their failure,had my flight cancelled by air france they failed to get me rescheduled on another air france flight so we had to fly another airline they failed to cover additional costs it took to fly another airline involved for the same day said they had operational issues hung us out to dry due to their failure
15424,olympic air,7,olympic air customer review,delays are pathogenic to olympic air athtia left with 25 minutes delay the plane was a q400 new but uncomfortable and noisy had a window seat which was not reclining and there was no window shutter newspapers were not offered lunch was not offered on a tray but a plastic box with sandwich and a confection after drinks coffee they gave us box with cookies return with a319 change of equipment was probably because there was still a problem of delays the aircraft did not have a business class area we were offered newspapers in the old way manner left on the galley to be picked up but this time food offered on a tray tasteless and indifferent i could not complain but the service was not remarkable the hostesses were all girls there is clearly a problem with men stewards friendly and more than helpful
10421,germanwings,7,germanwings customer review,cgnlis booked long ago 052013 when their new fare scheme smart best etc was not implemented yet thus i sat in seat 1f with generous legroom but got only a few points credited but it was a good price and a generally acceptable standard as far as baggage allowance seat quality etc is concerned flight left a little late no apology or reason given but with good tailwinds we made an on time arrival service on board was ok although the quality of their turkey salami sandwich is well below my standard its just the fluffy britishamerican sandwich style not using the crispy rolls we like in germany on such longer flights of more than two hours they should offer a pasta or a similar hot dish as their parent company does on similar routes beverages were served as well standard ones free of charge special ones or alcoholic drinks for a hefty price which is unacceptable to me almost five euros for a small bottle of wine 187 ml in a plastic glass no newspapers or other entertainment friendly and efficient service i have to tell myself again and again you get what you paid for and thats what i did on this flight
18347,sky airline,6,good low cost alternative,good low cost alternative to latam with a group i flew from santiago to punta arenas the flights were on time and the service was very good the only comments are that the seat pitch isnt brilliant we flew once on newer aircraft the pitch seemed limited and the check in at scl was a bit of a nightmare if checking in bags turn up 2 hours pre departure as there were queues would fly with sky again as their prices are favourable compared to the national carrier if youre from europe this airline is comparable to easyjet
17912,shanghai airlines,8,shanghai airlines customer review,hkgpvghkg fm810 b767 friendly checkin staff speedy boarding and fantastic catering and onboard service return flight efficient checkin though no self checkin machines and offered an extra legroom seat 1st row of the economy cabincheerful service from the crew and a tasty 3 course lunch
5493,batik air,3,dont fly batik air,pekanbaru to jakarta dont fly batik air starting from the ground service it is the worst actually we got no choice as we ran out seat of garuda indonesia the boarding process is the worst out there there were no specific boarding call for business class passenger passenger with kids etc the plane is quite a new a320 at least we took off on time but landed a bit off schedule due to traffic congestion at jakarta the service was quite friendly it offers you a snack box consisting of a pizza bread and a muffin which is surprisingly quite tasty there were no hot drinks or soft drinks service as they told us bad weather however during most of the flight the weather is pretty fine except when we were about to land in jakarta back to the seat to my surprise again the aircraft is equipped with inflight entertainment however the selection is really bad though the screen is very responsive the seat is also hard unlike garuda indonesia which the seat is so much better than batik pricing wise the ticket is also an overpriced 160 sing dollar with that amount of money i could have flown silk air to some parts of indonesia otherwise please think twice before you book a batik air flight
19368,sunwing airlines,2,i will never fly sunwing again,hamilton to varadero we flew out saturday jan 18 of 2020 only to be delayed five hours out of hamilton airport was to arrive at 7pm but landed at 1230 am then we get through customs go to retrieve suitcase not there then when we were to fly back home we were to land at 12 midnight but it was 330 in the morning so overall eight hours lost plus suitcase for three days put in a compensation report to sunwing they reply back is no compensation ive never experienced such bad service i will never fly sunwing airlines again
1722,air france,2,baggage did not make the destination,our baggage did not make the destination airport air france told me initially that i will get them the day after today which i have been told is no longer the case right now i already expect them tomorrow i live in the czech republic and i have spent 1 month in spain i had to take casual and business clothes with me as well as gym clothes as a consequence i do not have clothes to work tomorrow neither for my gym session additionally i have my winter jacket in the missing baggage being in prague and being in winter i can not go anywhere without it for this reason i am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so i can make it through the day tomorrow air france does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say i have a permanent and not a temporary address i do not care what the policy say this is going to cost me money and make me waste time being such a well known company i trusted air france the whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk afterwards having to call the company and waiting for customer service to answer so you can get to follow up your case with disappointment to hear that it is not going to make it on the right time followed by wasting time shopping things that you already have how is possible that a customer can not be compensated for such a cost waste of time and bad experience
12952,korean air,2,prestige class i dont think so,prestige class that got me wondering so i called to hear what that covered and was told that it was equivalent to business and as you can see on the korean air app they have economy prestige and first class it made sense wrong the first long leg from amsterdam to incheon korea was fine own cabin flat bed 12 hours went fine food good and service ok annoying with face masks only airline ive had to wear it for the last year or more next leg incheon to auckland i was apparently downgraded to lower class prestige is not just prestige you have to be sure that you have prestige suites all the way because now i had a wide leaning chair that was too narrow and too short to really rest well and it didnt go flat even worse during the little sleep i managed to get i was woken up twice by the stewardess because my face mask was not positioned right arriving to new zealand tired after 30 hours of transportation i saw that one of my bags with priority tag on was wrapped in plastic destroyed in line with luggage service after spending 15 hours in passport line but finally got the document proving my bag was destroyed they didnt have a replacement like mine now after spending time again and again on mail i still havent been compensated as they will only pay part of what my bag is worth and only against a receipt that i dont have prestige class i dont think so flying korean air again i am sure i wont
12519,jetstar japan,7,check in was really intense,flying from tokyo nartia to taipei arrived at the airport 2 hours in advanced the check in was really intense only 2 staff member were working at this time had to queue for one hour and thirty minutes before check in some jetstar staff arrived to help their colleagues but i was really nervous with many other passengers that i will miss that plane but they succeeded to checkin everyone on time they had no time to be friendly but nobody was asking for that at this time so good on them for this even though it made me very nervous they stayed very professional and pretty organized an airport staff was checking the weight of every luggage on the line to speed everything up the seats are not very comfortable and no inflight entertainment but i paid for it the plane had just 20 minutes delay which was acceptable for me
5849,bmi regional,4,they are always delayed,bristol to frankfurt bmi from bristol has a bad reputation the planes and staff are great but they are always delayed looking down the departure board at bristol on a monday morning and all of the delayed flights will be bmi the sad thing is this could be a great service especially for the business traveller but increasingly you cannot rely on the airline and i have started to use less convenient airports because there is a chance their flights will be on time worse still bmi never answer any queries on their flight delays so if you have an easy schedule and dont mind being delayed by 34 hours then i recommend bmi
11631,iran air,3,iran air customer review,checkin is efficient fokker aircraft are ok while the russian tupolev aircraft should be avoided at all cost the snack provided was standard the staff was generally friendly all in all an average airline
8352,edelweiss air,7,reimbursed me all my costs,i had previously been critical of my flight to la palma where the plane was diverted and i tried to get reimbursement for my costs incurred to reach my destination however after a longish delay the airline reimbursed me all my costs so full credit to them
22271,vlm airlines,7,vlm airlines customer review,cabin crew fantastic as always have flown every week with this airline since it started in april 2015 the flights were 104 euros return the cheapest flight now for a commuter to london is 204 euros if you book months in advance that is 4 times the price of ryanair if you dont book in advance a commuter flight is well over 300 euros its just not worth it travel to cork or dublin and save yourselves thousands a year if you commute regularly
13927,lion air,2,extremely uncomfortable,it is expected that lion air jt 955 lombok to bali would be late departure as most lion air flights are after midday the two hour delay for operational reasons was expected however with no notification of the delay until you reach the airport always makes things frustrating the biscuits and water for the children helped pass the time however when boarding we all felt claustrophobic and short of breath there seemed to be no air conditioning and the temperature in the airplane had each of us sweating profusely with most travellers only getting relief from using safety cards to fan themselves towards the end of the short flight it did really seem that we were cooking in the aircraft relief was only felt when getting outside the back door to get some fresh cool air while i understand lion air is usually late other than if you catch an early morning flight the travel conditions on this particular flight was extremely uncomfortable and unnerving for the family
20774,transaero airlines,2,transaero airlines customer review,i was on a short hop from kiev to moscow they called it discount class flight the price tag was well over what aeroflot and other legacy carriers asked but i needed to be late night at domodedovo so bought it the check in was polite but was informed about recent hand baggage rules change they demanded to pack my backpack into a hold bag and to proceed to a plane with laptop bag only when onboard was shocked with the seat pitch ryanair looks generous after that overcrowded accommodation you have literally no room to seat plus passengers can recline leaving you no room even to move the snack service was pathetic with peace of bread in plastic crew were polite but not up to other airlines standards the plane was old the toilet was smelly deplaning in moscow was via bus i used to be their loyalty program active user so accumulated some miles trying to used them i was unable to book reward ticket via website this option leads you to a error message on the payment page overall overpriced and substandard not recommended
7890,cubana airlines,3,cubana airlines customer review,flew yulcccyul flight was 2 hours late no announcement made at check in or gate we only found out about the delay by looking at the airport screens plane is a bus with wings an old a320 leased from avion express no tv no magazines only reading material was the safety card no air sickness bag poor service on board pressed the call button but no flight attendant came by needed water for medicine for the bar service the flight attendant ran down the aisle i didnt see them serve one alcoholic drink need to pay to anyone and finished the plane in 5 mins the seat pitch is quite small and im 61 and was touching the seat in front of me with no entertainment makes it a very long flight wont be flying cubana again
21228,turkish airlines,5,no second service for drinks,boarding started with a delay of 50 minutes because the plane did arrive late however this was less as the delay for boarding rather old plane 2 2 2 configuration in business class after a welcome drink a not so great breakfast was served in 2 services fas were friendly after the meal the cabin was darkened despite this was a flight that with the delay left at 930 am nearly the entire flight with dimmed lights no second service for drinks several connecting flights were announced others not i will not chose that company again
15372,olympic air,8,olympic air customer review,took a quick 45min flight from athens to one of the greek isles milos and was pleasantly surprised a very good price both tofrom flights departed on time cabin crews were extremely friendly and did a quick beverage service the flight is by propeller plane plane itself was dated and has maybe 20 seats total and does bus to runway boarding overall a very good experience and was the same price though like 4 hours faster than taking a ferry from athens so id definitely recommend the trip
19912,thai airasia,6,on time and uneventful,flight was on time and uneventful cabin crew on this flight wasnt very friendly which is unusual for airasia the captain did not make any effort to address the pax not one single announcement made by him which i only experience on air asia
11354,icelandair,1,what an awful experience,what an awful experience the difficulties began while trying to extend a voucher covid 19 cancellation in 2021 several times i waited an hour on hold before talking to customer service who were either consciously or unwittingly deceiving after several months of back and forth i finally got the voucher the first leg of our flight from boston to coppenhagen via rejkavik was one of the most uncomfortable ive experienced the stewardesses were indifferent at best the woman next to me sat with her meal for 2 hours before they came by to pick it up the cabin was improperly ventilated hot and stuffy to the extent that my wife and i had headaches and nausea when we touched down no wonder the stewardesses were grumpy a day before the return flight icelandair informs that there will be no wifi or in flight entertainment available which confirms my suspicion that icelandair is a low budget airline charging high budget prices i guess they can count on summer traffic from us and europe to iceland so not much incentive to care about quality never again
15572,onur air,2,onur air customer review,we flew from manchester we were late boarding and no explanation as to why when we had boarded we were left on the plane for 45 minutes before taking off the inflight staff were unhelpful and quite rude when the food had been served they started selling cigarettes and other items without clearing away the food packages passengers were left taking the cartons to the staff areas themselves and staff were reluctant to take them the staff were disorganized and kept pushing past passengers as their trolleys did not seem to be adequately stocked for some of the time there was no water to wash your hands with after using the toilet facilities when we landed in turkey the staff changed and they were somewhat better the return journey was less stressful but still had its problems we boarded slightly late the pilot explained that we had to refuel and the staff were changing over it became obvious that something was wrong and we were advised that a tyre needed changing and we had to disembark we were ferried onto a coach dumped in the airport and then after thankfully a 45 minute wait we re boarded and continued our journey thankfully without any further disruption

12923,klm royal dutch airlines,3,experience was disappointing,i flew klm from delhi to amsterdam and have to say the experience was disappointing i have no idea how it is rated a four star airline we departed on time at 3am the staff in india were not friendly the seats are rather uncomfortable my audio wasnt working properly no pillows are provided despite it being a 10 hour night flight the service starts with only a hot pocket and drink no alcohol on board the flight for economy class the cups are extremely small as well portion isnt good about 2 hrs prior to landing we got the breakfast meal it consisted of a watery paneer with paratha the yogurt tasted sour and they didnt have proper chai there is no hindi speaker on board the flight either staff are okay but they really need to improve the quality and quantity of food on board for india this was worst than flying united from delhi to newark
11967,jeju air,9,jeju air customer review,my wife and i were on flight from gmpcju and cjupus last june 2013 we were very much satisfied with the on time performance ground and on board services although they were budget airlines but their services were as good as the full service one surprisingly we were not charged for checked baggage as the other budget airline in south east asia did we were with 738 aircraft for the fist stint but old 734 for the later one snack were provided still
15820,pegasus airlines,9,a very pleasant flight,punctual takeoff and landing perfect ground service and cabin crew seating might have been better but not a major problem for a short haul overall a very pleasant flight for a very good price surely recommended
9128,eurowings,2,misleading checkin experience,really disappointing unprofessional and misleading checkin experience im a long time traveler ftl member of miles and more for may years and have to date never had such an awful checkin its shameful to think that eurowings is owned by lufthansa to start with the online checkin simply doesnt work there are several ways to do this all of which keep throwing errors we had two separate bookings and for both we werent able to complete the online checkin due to errors to make matters worse at the airport checkin we found out that the rules for luggage dont respect the measurements and weights advertised online be careful the online specifications for luggage are meant to be misleading instead of what is advertised eurowings checkin staff use a special book with pictures which we were presented with to justify some type of luggage categories which include properties such as wheels or handles and which ultimately is meant to make us pay additionally take care these luggage descriptions are not available online and are not respecting what is sent as information when you make your booking for us this meant that even though my luggage respected the dimensions for small hand luggage 40x30x25 because it was on wheels it counts as a different category so we were told to pay for additional luggage to add insult to injury for the additional piece of luggage we were told that if we want the normal price of 25 instead of 44 we must do this through the app which im sure you guessed by now threw out an error on the last step when payment details were submitted the conclusion im forced to draw is that eurowings uses a combined strategy of faulty digital service with deliberate misleading information so that it can make extra money of its clients
13074,kulula,3,service levels have dropped,durban to lanseria every time i fly kulula on a friday evening the last flight is delayed from 1945 to 2030 now which means i arrive home at midnight if it was a one off i would understand but its always a friday delay on the last flight absolutely unreliable kulula used to be the airline that was always on time service levels have dropped i will definitely reconsider using kulula in future
14895,myanmar airways,6,it did not disappoint,bangkok to yangon retjurn in midmay this is my first experience with this airline and it did not disappoint the checkin at the airport for both flights were uneventful efficiently handled and most notably having little or no queues which is always a welcomed sight when there are snaking queues at neighbouring counters for other airlines the boarding for the outgoing flight started a little after the scheduled time the planes do not have any seatback entertainment units but for the outgoing flight there was onboard wifi which allow you free access to a selection of movies and tv shows on the mai app which can be preloaded onto phones ipads etc the selection was limited for a 6570 min flight it is impressive that the cabin crew is able to come round with wet tissues followed by a meal and drinks service the cabin crew were polite and cheerful the captain made announcements regularly which were spoken in clear english
18498,skywest airlines,3,skywest airlines customer review,in modesto ca a city of about 200000 skywest is the only airline that serves our airport with multiple daily flights to both sfo and lax lax service unfortunately to end soon realizing that one cant realistically expect a comfy boeing or airbus jet on these short thin routes skywest does at least get you there although anyone beginning his or her trip with skywest or any regional should try to depart as early as possible as these planes easily get backlogged during their multisegment days and are given last priority to land and big hub airports i have flown skywest many times to both airports recently unfortunately they use the dreaded embraer brasilia turboprop on those routes which is very cramped loud seats dont recline and the lav its a bit of a stretch to call it that is nothing but a midsized compartment that even i at only 510 cant stand up in there is no running water the sole fa must actually crouch under the galley counter to allow you into the lavatory all of us midsized western city residents will breathe a huge sigh of relief when skywest finally gets rid of all these dreadful beatup planes and replaces them with regional jets
9455,finnair,1,at least feed your passengers,i have been flying backforth all over the world for decades onflight food totally varies qualitywise but there is always enough food flew recently from oslo to delhi normally its like a 6 hrs flight but due to ukrainerussia war and detour the flight time extended to 8 hrs our first meal came approx around one hour after take off its was a gnocchi pasta with tomato sauce one small piece of bread bun butter and some potato salad the amount was little and i thought it as a first start of the journey course then a later meal would be the main course that didnt happen almost six hours later one hour before landing we got a muffin for breakfast on an 8 hrs flight the food wasnt enough for a hungry stomach that hadnt been eating for above six hours i have never seen anything like that before to finnair i understand that you have had an extreme loss due to covid and nobody was traveling but with all that high ticket prices that you now have at least feed your passengers
16736,regional express,5,regional express customer review,early morning flight form sydney to wagga with a return the next day both flights departed on time and the cabin crew member on both legs were friendly and genuine on each flight a coffeetea and biscuit served bags were on carousel by the time i reached the terminal the bus trip out to the plane from the terminal at sydney adds a nice touch and gives one a different view of the airport this is a fantastic little airline with a real charm about it and its service standards are truly something to be admired well worth flying with
6546,cathay dragon,9,satisfactory for a regional sector,hong kong to qingdao the check in process was in order and prompt this flight was operated by cathay dragon a330300 which boarding gate was assigned to terminal 1 when i arrived at the boarding gate there were many passengers waiting for the gate the boarding announcement was called approximately 50 minutes prior to departure the process was conducted row by row in systematically order which special needs passengers are given priority being a marco polo green member i had the advantage of queuing at the special lane dedicated to the airlines frequent flyers flight attendant were busy greeting and assisted us to the assigned seat once boarded the flight to qingdao left the gate on time and was relatively full cathay dragon is renowned for being one of the best regional airlines lunch and cold beverages were served shortly after take off the cabin crew returned to serve hot beverages two selection were available on board that is hot coffee and tea hot beverages were served without meal cart and the process is usually faster overall flight experience was smooth and satisfactory for a regional short sector i look forward to fly with cathay dragon again in the near future
828,air astana,4,rescheduled for a morning flight,i booked with air astana for a flight from tashkent to astana transiting in almaty our flight was delayed for over an hour in astana an additional one hour later than my original booking this meant that i now have too short a transit time and need to be rescheduled i received an sms advising that i am rescheduled for a morning flight arrival 10 am the next day instead of 6 pm i then went into frantic messages to my hotel in astana cancelling my booking about aud100 extra for a few hours on checkin i was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me so i am unaware of this land in almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher there i am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm so again frantic messages to my hotel after over 20 minutes running around to get a kazakh sim card to rebook my room i found the place now fully booked called them and thankfully they rebooked my room
21314,united airlines,2,they truly do not care,the worst experience ive ever had if you can try to avoid united their system was down the more i got to the airport they were unable to print out my boarding pass which made me miss my flight they found and alternative route to get to my destination but manage to leave my checkin luggage back home horrible communication skills got to my destinations with absolutely no clothes and still wanting for some sort of compensation please look for alternative options before flying with united they truly do not care
3800,akasa air,7,newest of all indian airlines,newest of all indian airlines started just 2 months back another lcc ticket price competitive boarding was smooth flight was on time seats just ok as per lcc standard cabin was clean and hygienic cabin crew courteous
7473,copa airlines,5,the frills are rapidly disappearing,just back from a quick trip from jfk to medellin via pty in copas business class as usual they do the basics right planes leave and arrive on time cabin service is professional and the seat while still a recliner has a lot more leg room than most other airlines serving northern south america beyond that in a supposedly full serve airline the frills are rapidly disappearing no pillows no choice of meals in business plastic tumblers for the wine on the connection from and to pty a tiny wifi screen and terrible earphones disorganized and repetitive document checks and all this comes at quite a price there is a quite nice new lounge in the recently opened terminal extension but the only food on offer are so called tuna sandwiches in effect stale bread rolls with an impossibly thin layer of tuna paste instead of scrimping and cutting incessantly why not think the other way around and put another 10 on the j ticket that might fund a little bit more tuna and turn the rolls into an actual sandwich it might fund the return of pillows and a dinner roll slightly larger dinner portion maybe more carefully prepared a real wineglass and a few more lettuce leaves in the mini salad small thing matter to make an 8 hour trip into a less of an endurance test
2035,air koryo,2,food is best left alone,i make quite regular trips from beijing capital to pyongyang sunan and i cannot reconcile with your latest reviews here i belief that safety requires staff to be able to communicate in the international english language and that is still very poor for air koryo none of us can truly speak for their maintenance but from local standards in other industry this will be a continued concern for some persons the food is best left alone which i now do air koryo supply outbound and inbound flights from pyongyang and cuisine standards there are certainly not the best i think many my fellow foreign travellers are more interested in flying tupolev airplanes or checking if n korea is really people say best of luck with that but this is not airline you would choose if there were more operators to choose guess thats not going to change in the near times
6870,china airlines,7,a decent business class,melbourne to osaka via taipei returning from sapporo overall china airlines offers a decent business class at a reasonable fare both checkin processes were efficient and friendly the lounges in melbourne taipei and sapporo were comfortable without being luxurious good spaces to relax with pleasant food and drink options on board the seats turned into nice lieflat beds the main downside being a lack of storage space around the seats the crews were hardworking polite and generally friendly only soft drinks were offered as a welcome but there was a reasonable wine and spirits list my vegetarian meals were fine but not adventurous no amenities kits were provided and there were no toothbrushespaste provided in the toilets a sign of some cutting of corners in this product three flights operated punctually one was delayed 30 minutes due to ground handling issues taipei is quite an easy transfer point with good signage and friendly staff
12429,jetstar asia,1,no service recovery,singapore to danang on 8dec my jetstar flight 3k541 was supposed to depart singapore at 650pm however upon push out the captain mentioned there is some technical issue with the plane so we have to return to the gate to let ground staff to check after the checks the captain mentioned to us good news the issue is resolve and we will be able to fly in 20 minutes however the captain mentioned once again they have to do further checks and sign some documents so we have to return to the gate again from the start when announced there was a delay no service recovery was given to us no drinks or nuts or anything was given to us while waiting so after about another 30 minutes wait we were told that due to company policy they have to arrange a replacement aircraft for us at gate c17 if there is a need for us to change aircraft at the start why do you let us have false hope saying we will be at the sky within 20 mins and let us just wait in the aircraft like some idiots furthermore from e24 to c17 was so far apart and very long distance why cant the replacement aircraft be parked nearer it have cause much inconvenience to my grandparents we finally boarded the plane at about 950 and took the skies at 1045pm from 650 to 1045 it is a more than 3 hours delay no refreshment voucher was given to us no service recovery letting passengers just wait and stranded
22924,xiamen airlines,3,for the chinese not others,chongqing to xiamen an airline that would be for the chinese people not others we had two flights with them chongqing to xiamen then on to ho chi min both flights had delays of over an hour food was pretty bad although some english spoken it wasnt understandable
667,aigle azur,7,aigle azur customer review,paris orly to lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes aigle azur worth considering cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a paid drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight the airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time dinner no food or snack service provided but not a loco as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry
8117,dragonair,6,dragonair customer review,ka872 hkgpvg bus to the plane the seat is the old version legroom is very tight there were no entertainment system onboard not even a public tv food and beverage quality impressed me although it is a short flight of 2 hours staff give you the menu before take off there were two choices and different selection of beverages plus a hagendazs ice cream
17991,sichuan airlines,4,departure nearly an hour late,dayong to chongqing with sichuan airlines very disappointed as previous experience with sichuan airlines had been positive flight departure time came and went without any indication of a problem the plane had arrived on time and was well visible from the departure lounge with an eventual chaotic busbased boarding from a rearranged gate departure was nearly an hour late staff appeared as browned off with life as the passengers
19888,tap portugal,6,still a very solid and reliable product,overall good experience and i would do it again pros brand new plane with top notch entertainment system including selection of 150 movies the captain was very attentive to the passengers and communicating regularly particularly during a long period of moderate turbulence which was scary he also explained why they left with a small delay related to the late arrival of the previous flight from tel aviv the online booking and checkin system was flawless and very intuitive cons boarding from a remote stand in lisbon but thats not the airlines fault inflight staff was efficient but not particularly friendly like in asian airlines food was not great but still edible the lunch was served immediately after take off and then a light meal was served just before landing considering the flight was almost 8 hours there were more than 6 hours between meals and no drinks or food were served during that period tap long haul is not a slam dunk but still a very solid and reliable product to take you from europe to north america my favourite feature was the inflight entertainment system i regretted not getting the economy xtra seat for almost 8 hours it is probably worth it as the standard seat is very cramped and for anyone over 180 m it will not be that comfortable
7515,copa airlines,1,the most incompetent airline,bag was submitted at checkin counter in so paulo cm758 one bag never arrived 2 bags did arrive ok when i got to lax i contact copa airline for my missing bag and they told me that would contact me back by email but it been almost 3 mouths and still no contact or help from copa i called every week and they put me on hold for one hour and never solve my problem missing bag is probably in so paulo gru the id was attached to the bag and the bag went on conveyor behind checkin desk but im not sure where is my bag copa airlines did not do anything to find my luggage it like they dont care and all my clothing is gone i dont know what to do anymore to get my bag back or to get hold with copa i sent multiple email and no answer please dont flight this airline they are the worst and the most incompetent airline
2062,air koryo,2,air koryo customer review,pekfnj interesting to say the least outbound was oldest plane i have ever seen in my life il62 and literally falling apart at the seams propaganda handed out announcements regarding how this flight was made possible by the dear leader etc return was same aircraft type but much better shape however upon landing in beijing was quickly sweating due to no air conditioning not like you have much of a choice when flying to pyongyang snag air china if you want a safe flight but air koryo if you want the experience
14671,meridiana,9,courteous and helpful,i travel almost monthly from milano to munich and i appreciate the service and punctuality of the meridiana flight the flight is convenient as it leaves in mid afternoon from linate the city airport and it is always on time also on the return from munich flight assistants are courteous and helpful only drawback is that in milano the plane does not disembark to a finger but uses a bus shuttle i imagine that this is done to save money as fingers are more expensive at least this usually translates into cheap fares compared to aother travel options as car or train as it is not a lowcost carrier meridiana has the advantage of the possibilty to checkin at the airport at no extra cost
12527,jetstar japan,2,disregard for passenger comfort,after a recent horror of an experience flying with jetstar to honolulu and back id dreaded a prebooked trip from sydney to narita with a stop in cairns on the forward and aft leg they didnt disappoint in their complete disregard for passenger comfort it took 90 minutes to check in at narita on the return flight which left 1015 minutes to get through customs security leaving no time for a meal so we were forced to eat on board because i didnt have a credit card ready the food cart kept going an hour later i approached them and ordered the cabin staff told me it would take 20 minutes about an hour later i again asked them where it was as they were only too happy to take my card eventually it came during that time i observed about 56 cabin crew running around with first priority serving alcohol i was seated on the aisle of an emergency row seat and i saw no no preflight compliance check about willingness and capacity of how to assist in the event of an emergency and what our roles would be should the crew members be incapacitated its my last flight with this lot a pity as the fleet themselves are relatively new and crews on the flight decks are clearly competent but the handling of checkins and treatment of passengers by cabin crews are a bridge too far good bye
9159,eva air,1,no one at the check in,all flights were cancelled at terminal 1 naia due to technical problems all passengers of eva air br278 were waiting in line for about an hour and there was no one at the check in counter to explain what we do next and only a piece of paper showing contact numbers were given to us to rebook my first time to fly eva air because my husband had very good things to say about the airline the flight was to depart to taipei at 1850 and i have a connecting flight to lax at 2355 there was no one at the check in counter and the office was closed at 5pm text message to my phone about flight cancellation was received at 431pm and paper with contact information was passed around at around 445pm
19714,tam airlines,5,tam airlines customer review,ezegrucdg in december first leg on a330 rather comfortable due to wide bodied plane but catering disappointing the usual hamcheese croissant and cheap lemonades no coffeetea service or beer on a 25 hrs scheduled international flight grucdg was pleasant due to a brand new 777 plane and despite the 343 layout in the economy cabin rather comfortable the design of this aircraft was very stylish and all super clean almost luxurious inflight entertainment decent but again catering rather poor at least wine and beer served plus coffee and a continental breakfast before landing due to low fare i was rather satisfied but would not like to spend more than the lowest fare because of the subpar catering ground handling staff were very friendly while on board crew just professional but not unpleasant
15678,openskies,6,openskies customer review,paris to newark roomy seats that recline allowing you to get a comfortable rest lots of space between rows you can have up to 3 pieces of luggage up to 23 kg however worn out seats and old noisy plane flight attendants werent very attentive there was no duty free on board they give you an old handheld screen with a limited choice of films the meal took a very long time with a 1 hour wait between dishes food was average do not book the aisle seat on the first row of business seats as there is less leg room because of the emergency exit door
13477,lao airlines,7,lao skyway customer review,luang prabangchiang mai brand new atr very clean and comfortable served strange chicken roll cake and soft drink or beer quite hard to understand the cabin and flight crew sometimes but felt very safe and departedarrived early flights pretty expensive considering length of flight and general lao prices
13641,lc per,9,without any complications,i flow with lc per from lima to cuzco and back service onboard was perfect legroom okay crew very friendly and professional and both flights on time i also booked a flight to the north cost of peru with lc per unfortunately they canceled this route giving me an alternative flight with another airline lan also giving me the possibility to notice that lc is by far better than lan now latam but the servie of rebooking paying far more for the new ticket than i paid for the lc flight was quite good and surprisingly without any complications
11616,iran air,5,iran air customer review,i fly iranair both within iran and also on their international routes aircrafts are old but clean with generous leg room inflight service is very basic and on long flights if you can sleep you wont be missing anything the food is good and the cabin crew are friendly you can not rely on ontime performance so i would only fly them if i didnt have to make a connection a very good airline for the money
10446,germanwings,2,germanwings customer review,booked lufthansa flight cologneberlin on 28 jan on 2 jan i got the information that the flight was operated by germanwings a german lowcost carrier so was the flight low cost 1 hrs delayed for my beer i had to pay in euros cash lounge use was denied as the flight was operated under 4u code no service for a high lufthansa price not recommended very disappointed
16719,regional express,6,regional express customer review,flew adlplo recently staff member at the gate was very unprofessional always on his mobile and was very dismissive of my query showed little interest in providing any level of customer service something as simple as boarding the 36 passengers on the flight seemed to be an inconvenience for him on board flight attendant on the other hand was outstanding and looked after everyone on board very well even booking me a taxi inflight inflight service pretty good teacoffee with snack and a mentos for landing the plane itself was very old being a saab 340 i expected this but the plane has not even been modernised and the cold water tap in the toilet had been decommissioned and replaced with hand sanitiser all up rex operate like an airline that knows it has a monopoly on many of its routes given the conduct of their ground staff and condition of their planes
7143,citilink,8,customer service excellent,jogjakarta to jakarta citilinks customer service is excellent in my recent trip an hour before the flight departed i just arrived to the airport definitely i missed my flight but i got express checkin assisted by the staff including 3 of my bags i received my ticket and boarded on time in flight i got seated on the 2nd row from the front which was quite surprising because i was late really recommended for another great low cost airlines
699,air algerie,6,air algerie customer review,algaae the flight to annaba took 1hr and was uneventful air algerie will always serve you a drink and a close an eye to your baggage allowance which is good but service is nondescript and like many airlines of north africa when there is a problem there is nobody to speak to and nobody is responsible for anything so when flying them have lots of time on your hand patience and a good book their prices are usually good especially for domestic flights would fly them again but as i said it is nothing memorable
72,adria airways,5,adria airways customer review,it is reliable and with good connections between balkans and western europe however i always find the service on the leg between skopje and ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg ljubljana amsterdam ljubljana frankfurt etc the crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches assuming that because of the muslim travelers i insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it twice on the leg ljubljanaskopje or vice versa if adria pretends to be a quality part of star alliance it shouldnt distinguish among the passengers which fly skopje ljubljana and those flying from ljubljana to western europe
23055,xl airways france,7,xl airways france customer review,this is a no frills operation but they do it right the on board staff was friendly and courteous and the plane was clean we traveled from jfk to paris and returned after 10 days it was difficult to hear and see the movies they played but for those who read this is not a problem the seats seemed small and not well padded the planes took off and arrived on time a big plus and we did not have to wait long for our luggage the woman who checked us in in paris was exceptionally nice no complaints and i would use this airline again
16911,royal air maroc,5,delayed more than 15 hours,montreal to beirut via casablanca flights rescheduled for more than 5 hours so my arrival turned to be 2days instead of 1 day both flights were delayed for more than 15 hours ground staff in casablanca were rude and unfriendly to me

21263,turkmenistan airlines,5,bring your own water and food,paris to ashgabat check in baggage allowance was 25 kg not the 33 that most others have flight left on time 23 full plane new but no entertainment except map overhead seats maybe cheapest ive ever seen like most 737 planes rows near exit doors do not recline food was hot ok but definitely not the ritz no alcohol served plenty of soft drinks if you are squeamish bring your own water and food and entertainment the big complaint was someone smoking and no one said a thing it stunk up the whole cabin staff emotionless price was cheap so value for the trip was ok ashgabat airport is new almost no one speaks english and definitely not french i went in expecting horrid and disastrous but all in all was a new experience

10466,go first,8,handled the situation very well,i fainted in the flight and where some crew may have panicked in some cases this crew handled the situation very well provided me with all the necessary assistance and first aid and was very kind and humble till the end
801,air arabia,1,i enjoyed the flight,i travelled from sharjah to colombo on air arabia in june the flight was full but i was comfortable the flight was about four hours long i checked in online but my phone failed so got replacement boarding pass at baggage drop i enjoyed the flight and will fly them again
16017,philippine airlines,4,overall were ok nothing special,pricewise this is the cheapest airline on this route but a 6 hour longer detour flights overall were ok nothing special food and service on both flights so so very limited choice and not very tasty staff not very attentive however on this point i must say that wearing these facemasks does not contribute all by all nothing special and in our view an airline at the lower end of the spectrum pretty good seat and plenty of leg room on the a321 in the a330 the inflatable cushion of the seat was not working and one of us had to sit on the metal frame maintenance staff could not solve the issue cabin staff finally offered a pillow not very comfortable on a night flight lying flat lie flat seat it was pretty ok the transfer on naia was an absolute disaster it had a major impact on the overall experience hence our overall view on pal we had 3 hours to transfer and it took us 2 hour ground staff is keeping themselves busy with inexplicable activities leaving a queue of hundreds of passengers who had to crawl through a very small space in the dark first one had to obtain a small stamp on the boarding pass for what reason unclear nothing was additionally checked after that the cabin luggage had to be scanned again was already scanned in sin suitcases had to be picked out and opened for another check drugs with a cotton wool pad but without putting it in an analyser afterwards the suitcases were loaded finally at the gate the cabin luggage was scanned again the experience on naia was absolutely stressful to put it mild the final question is would we fly pal again first reaction no not likely
13275,lan airlines,6,lower quality than other airlines,i normally fly with another airline but this time had to choose an option with latam for bogota to santiago return and bogota to cali one way route overall the service was acceptable but of a somewhat lower quality than the other airline firstly the planes are dated and started showing their age the inflight entertainment system bogscl is not very reliable the touchable screen does not work well while the entertainment system wired control is in the seat and any wrong body movement in the seat might cause its acting by itself besides there is no power outlet either since i am accustomed to use my flight time to work on this occasion i was disappointed that it was not possible because my computers battery died out quickly on another note the staff is doing their work but as many other reviews here have noted it is rather cold and not exactly very smiley half of my flights had been delayed though apparently due to the weather issue or airport traffic beyond the airline control yet i almost missed my connection in santiago because the luggage delivery was late while the airport international arriving area is small and crowded and there is a long line for customs only half the time the boarding is done by turns according to the rows of seats assigned when it is enforced is very convenient what stands out however is the quality of food provided on the longer legs in economy quite tasty with metal and not plastic fork and knife used unlimited and good quality wine and other spirits however there is not even a glass of water offered on the domestic bogota to cali flight all in all i will try to fly with another airline next time since latam did not achieve to convince me to change my preferences
6883,china airlines,1,service quality is going down,kaohsiung to hong kong i checked in at the kaohsiung airport today at the business class counter was greeted by two extremely rude desk staff completely surprised in the past i have always had good experience it it seems service quality is going down strongly encourage others to avoid this airline till they get their act together the flight itself was fine
18036,silkair,1,it delays all the time,kuala lumpur to singapore terrible it delays all the time as normal lccs do they tend to being a little better than the other lcc but it has nothing different no one apologize for the inconvenience caused by the flight i dont know why i should take this lcc though i purchase ticket from singapore airline all the time there is significant difference between the two brand and it causes obvious minus for the customers paid premium please dont use the poor option because of cheap cost
12076,jet2com,1,very little help from jet2 and many unanswered emails,on our return flight for a holiday in santorini with jet2 our luggage was delayed we were assured by jet2 that they would have our luggage couriered to us within 72 hours this didnt happen we spent many hours trying to locate our luggage with very little help from jet2 and many unanswered emails and different departments passing us around we have now been told by jet2 and the insurance that they sold us that they will not pay us any compensation without receipts for the contents of our bags this is a ridiculous situation who keeps the receipts for clothing luggage and toiletries just in case an incompetent airline looses their baggage we feel like jet2 have taken no responsibility for their mistake and that the insurance they sold us was next to useless

8553,el al israel airlines,4,never been a premium airline,i have been a loyal customer of el al for 40 years i have flown intensively especially during my years as a global marketing manager for an israeli company we are now retired and travel mainly for pleasure el al has never been a premium airline but we usually have been feeling secure safe and in good hands cabin crews have been attentive and an advantage for those that do not communicate in other language besides hebrew we pay a premium for that never mind our last flight may 2023 from prague to tlv has been a summit of disappointment first of all we pay to flight on full fare category and none of the low low cuts usual these days you want to be competitive do it by improving service not the opposite ways with cuts and cuts to start with the aircraft was i think sun dor vintage the sometime low cost company of el al they had probably rescued the plane from the el al vintage museum the aircraft had probably undergone some thorough technical check up no problems with the flight itself the cabin had been left for the last and forgotten my particular seat was found not within the safety norms and we were required to move to another row fortunately the emergency exit row was available but that is not the issue the widely advertised el al wifi inboard was not functioning in spite of the best efforts of the crew the sandwich was tasty but come on this was not a low cost flight no food no coffee water at the most we had the option to check our trolleys and avoid the hassles of cabin carrying for commodity we opted to carry them with us but with such an aircraft inside space was very limited and without too many explanations our trolleys were sent to the belly big difference the cabin crew was in generally attentive and managed to do their best the checking and boarding crew was unprofessional no hebrew speakers no israeli security personnel mind you we pay a premium to have israeli personnel in those positions including stations chiefs the boss of the departure crew could barely speak hebrew so if youre going to be like the others then the game is open for all the israeli travellers if you are not going to receive what you have been assured and paid for the last 40 years just come into the open and be like the others
18243,singapore airlines,8,service and crew were excellent,always loved singapore airlines and flew them in all classes many many times on this occasion flew them on a night flight from frankfurt to singapore aircraft got switched from an a350 onto a380 on the day and generally that is a great thing as always love an a380 however my bulk head seat was not the samegood option as it was on the a350 a380 business class bed is rather hard so not the most comfortable to sleep in in that regard prefer the a350777 and the older a380s much more i ordered a gluten free meal and unfortunately the dinner main was pretty much inedible which is a shame breakfast was fine however service and crew were excellent as usual
7087,china southern airlines,9,thoughtful cabin service,kuala lumpur to guangzhou clean and comfortable seats and thoughtful cabin service the friendly team of ground staff and clear immigration health inspection procedures left a deep impression on me finally we also got a great quarantine time in the hotel
6201,brussels airlines,1,a horrible experience,my first time with brussels airlines was a horrible experience i was travelling from bristol to budapest via brussels in the early morning today everything was fine until i landed in brussels i had good one hour to go through security and passport check but it did not turn out to be enough to get there without having to rush with my huge backpack apparently there was only one security lane open only 20 people could go through the check within 30 minutes some people were extremely stressed out as it was their final call and they were only about to move on to passport check where there were only two gates open at the time getting through passport check required another 20 minutes my luggage had to go through the scan 3 diffetent times during security check in brussels the otherwise very friendly gentleman in charge took the time to explain how the cheese and the cocoa powder in my backpack looked exactly like liquids on the screen he also told me there is generally no way to distinguish liquids from powder and cheese in the system without physically unpacking the entire luggage at this point please let me fundamentally question the technical efficiency of the security scanning at brussels airport i managed to get through the security and passport checks all of them so then i had to rush through the entire airport to get to my connection where i could somehow manage to arrive 1 minute before the gate closed i boarded to soon learn there were no more room left for my luggage in the luggage sacks i even had to go and ask the utterly careless stewardess for assistance who advised me to put all my belongings under the seat in front of me including my luggage of 55x40x23 cm size my coat and small bag come on now brussels airlines is there no place for everyones hand luggage on a plane anyway there will be no next time for me because i will avoid travelling with brussels airlines in the future it has been a terrible stressful and uncomfortable first experience i usually pick economy class and know what to expect for that price but never in my life have i experienced such discomfort during a flight the assistance the management and the technical background were all lousy meaning the company has failed to provide all important aspects of customer service
13030,korean air,9,like the foods on board,manila to toronto via seoul incheon i like the foods on board the service and entertainment also the amenities on board
18093,silkair,6,served refreshments very late,chennai to singapore with silkair mi435 flight attendants served the refreshments and meal very late as there appeared to be many trainees i had to wait for almost 3 hours to be asked by one of the flight attendant if i had been served when i asked for vegetarian food they said that all the vegetarian meals are over and only nonvegetarian is available i asked if there was an alternative and they provided me with a cup noodles they had totally missed out serving some seats it was poor service

11583,interjet,2,mean nasty and unpleasant,medellin to mexico city this was my first interjet flight the only good news is the flight was on time and we landed safely on the negative side i can honestly say i have never seen a crew on any airline so mean nasty and unpleasant im a 60 year old guy and asked for some water late in the flight the flight attendant snapped at me and said no we have no water they did not distribute landing cards before landing i had to ask for them as i left the flight they gave me one of the two required i saw them in customs and called them out on all of this their mean nasty attitudes unwillingness to pass out customs forms i dont need to be abused by these people if it was my company they all would be fired already for their lack of professionalism and disgraceful behavior amazingly when i walked them out on their nastiness they agreed with me and acknowledged it also their website is disingenuous they talk about wifi connectivity video screens audio all on some flights there is zippo unfortunately my return flight is in interjet but i will never fly them again and could not recommend
11592,intersky,4,intersky customer review,friedrichshafen hamburg it was one of my best experiences on a regional flightairline aircraft was clean the crew checkin to cabin crew was very polite as well as highly professional flight attendant made clearly understandable announcementssafety demos the only downside is that intersky asks passengers to pay prohibitive expensive prices for onboard drinkssnacks but since they consider themselves as a low cost airline truly providing lcc price level it was no surprise and everybody is free not to buy anything
14808,monarch airlines,3,experience is stressful,alicante to london gatwick from start to finish the monarch experience is a stressful one for weeks before you actually fly youll be bombarded with countdown emails inviting you to upgrade your seat purchase insurance etc once on board the pitch of seats on the more elderly exgb airways 321s is so ridiculous that the tray table cannot fully extend and you cant even reach down to pick up anything you might drop on the floor monarch do have seats with more generous legroom but these are sold off at 20 a pop once youre on the aircraft so far that reason even if your flight isnt entirely full youre forbidden from changing seat there is a constant push to shift alcohol even on early morning flights which results in a pretty rowdy cabin by landing airlines which adopt this practice of encouraging drinking at altitude only have themselves to blame for cabin trouble diversions arrests etc but it makes for a pretty unpleasant atmosphere for other passengers monarch continued to send me emails throughout my holiday and after arriving back home but ive made up my mind guys itll be the first and last time i use monarch unless you stop treating your flights like extremely cramped flying bars
21373,united airlines,1,fleet is old and trash,i booked this flight ua2394 months in advance selecting it because it was a non stop and a b737max they then cancel this flight at 1030pm the night before the flight on a holiday weekend leaving me without many options i had upgraded my seats to first class which i will now lose if im selected for standby more than likely not to mention its a poorer 737800 i was going for a friends wedding not only have they now ruined this wedding they try and stick me on standby on a one stop flight surely losing my first class seat without refunding my paid upgrade no doubt i dont care what they say about weather or traffic control their airlines is trash the way they treat their loyal customers is trash their fleet is old and trash their food is poor their loyalty program is terrible because they have too many 1kers you pretty much have to pay for an upgrade if you want one i finally got a flight on one of their few newer planes and they cancel it im going to get on every review site i can think and tell people to fly delta they are at least more reliable and probably have a newer fleet and may very well treat their loyalty customers better united is a greedy airline
6092,british airways,2,a lot of actual lies being told,despite being a gold member the british airways staff in heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service all the staff members repeat the same mantra we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours as if that would make the situation better there are no proactive updates no empathy no care but a lot of actual lies being told you can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals they show this in every action and word they say all of them are better suited to working away from other humans
5515,batik air,5,not too bad a service,flew batik air from sorong to jakarta on november 23rd the flight took off on time and landed in jakarta on schedule the business class seats are comfortable however there is very limited services onboard however the cabin crew were helpful baggage arrived within 15 minutes of landing overall not too bad a service
8824,ethiopian airlines,3,seat i had reserved was no longer available,during my flight in july 2023 a delay occurred the cabin crew assured us that the connecting flight would wait for cape town passengers and that ground staff had been informed however upon arriving at addis airport i found chaos with numerous delayed passengers and inadequate hotel accommodations arrangements furthermore my intransit luggage was missing for four hours adding further inconvenience and the seat i had reserved was no longer available i must highlight the unsatisfactory state of the toilets one toilet was blocked while another had accumulated years of sticky waste on the seat rim additionally the cabin crews uncooperative attitude in providing essential items for passengers such as swallowing tablets or providing wipes for hand cleanliness was concerning excessive noise from the kitchen area and lack of attention to passenger needs were also noticeable i would acknowledge the contrasting experience provided in business class i upgrade occasionally or buy extra shebamiles for upgrading or use shebamiles this is where passengers receive amenities like hot towels menus and recommendations regarding available choices as a loyal customer who has flown with et since 2011 i am disappointed to see the evident disparity in treatment between economy and business class passengers it is disappointing when flights scheduled to arrive on a specific day are delayed causing passengers to arrive a day later this lack of consistency with the dbxaddisct flights is worrying
11063,hong kong airlines,9,overall a nice experience,beijing to hong kong on hong kong airlines a330 2000hrs departure typical beijing air control crowded and a bit delayed not the carriers fault only 1 hour behind but would put us into hkg at 1230 and then to the hotel at 0200 in any case my first time with hong kong airlines boarded quickly separate doors for business and economy cabins seat 15f middle of the aircraft aisle warm greeting and beverage offered got settled and offered a refill nice touch nice larger aircraft on the run compared to others fully lie flat seats ife had decent choices for the 3 hour flight full meal service 3 choices beverages and nuts provided meal served quickly refills on beverages without having to ask deserts were tasty and ample english flawless and overall a nice experience give them a try

7837,csa czech airlines,7,friendly and nice cabin crews,my flight copenhagen prague on 9th may 2017 everything was perfect onboard the aircraft comfortable seats friendly and nice cabin crews the only problem was waiting for security control in copenhagen it is not the fault of csa czech airlines and secondly was that the flightdeck crew departed before even the safety demonstration video had not finished
12832,kenya airways,5,will look at alternatives in the future,nairobi to mauritius this was the final leg of the itinerary from manchester to mauritius manchester to nairobi flown with qatar airways flights sold by qatar airways this flight was a short 4 hour flight nairobi airport itself if not the best for transit though we spent the 7 hour layover in the pride business class lounge having paid 40 for a day pass which was satisfactory cabin crew appeared a little unfriendly on arrival onto aircraft though pleasant with requests and service the aircraft itself appeared old and tired and could benefit from modernisation for a small flight a light meal was provided which in honesty was good asian vegetarian sadly few flight announcements and no advice that the plane was descending into mauritius and landing it just landed no inflight entertainment screen did not work finally the timing of this flight is not good arrival at mauritius at 0300 in the morning is strange and untimely not sure why the schedule is this way but certainly not a time that i would be looking at again in the future in summary an ok airline convenient to ensure qatar airways flights for the route but will look at alternatives to mauritius in the future put it this was if qatar airways either fly directly to mauritius or have a transit in seychelles or johannesburg then this would be the preferred option nairobi is ok but i think the experience with kenya airways is not something i would revisit as experienced

10721,gulf air,8,has improved a lot,london to lahore via bahrain i have been a frequent flyer on gulf air and was assigned front seats on both travel legs gulf air has improved a lot but a few things need some improvement the drink service is too late as i finished my main meal without any drink and they gave the drinks when all passengers were being served the main meal which i felt was not helpful secondly the ife lacked variety and had limited choice transit was smooth however they changed the aircraft at the last minute and as i result half of my luggage came in the next flight which was in the evening i had to travel 4 hours from my home the next day to collect it from airport which was really annoying the good on bahlhe leg needs a lot of improvement and again the drinks were served long after i finished my meal

2757,air serbia,4,improving its income in this lousy way,before departure zurich belgrade in economy class i received an offer from air serbia by email to upgrade to business class i decided to accept the offer but only for the return flight belgrade zurich because i wanted to do some shopping in belgrade and there would be no room for this in just one suitcase it cost me 95 which was just debited from my mastercard at the checkin in belgrade surprise i have no right to 2 suitcases only one in response to my complaint that business class always includes an allowance for 2 suitcases i was told that i was entitled to all business class amenities except for the number of suitcases but this little thing is not to be found in the upgrade offer mail from air serbia this argument was also ignored by the air serbia officer in the end i had to pay another 6 for the excess 11kg heavy bag i suspect that this is not a coincidence but that air serbia is purposely improving its income in this lousy way vor dem abflug zrich belgrad in economy klasse habe ich von air serbia per mail ein angebot erhalten zu business class zu upgraden ich entschied mich das angebot zu akzeptieren jedoch nur fr den rckflug belgrad zrich weil ich einiges in belgrad einkaufen wollte und dies htte in nur einem koffer keinen platz mehr es kostete mich 95 die grad von meiner mastercard abgebucht wurden bei dem checkin in belgrad berraschung ich habe kein anrecht auf 2 koffer nur auf einen auf meine reklamation dass business class immer allowance auf 2 koffer beinhaltet wurde mir erklrt dass auf alle annehmlichkeiten der business class ich anrecht habe bis auf kofferanzahl diese kleinigkeit aber ist in der upgradeangebotmail von air serbia nicht zu finden auch dieser argument wurde von air serbia beamtin ignoriert am ende musste ich fr das berschssige 11kg schweren gepckstck weitere 65 zahlen ich vermute dass dies kein zufall ist sondern dass air serbia gezielt auf diese miese art ihre einknfte ausbessert

12277,jetblue airways,2,delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours,jetblue has to be the worst airline flying out of south florida right now especially since the fort lauderdale closure on april 12th jetblue has canceled the late night fort lauderdale to las vegas flight flight 607 three times one flight was canceled on a monday which 3 days after they actually opened up the airport that also means that the people in las vegas waiting for flight 607 cannot get back to fort lauderdale because the flight never gets to las vegas the ripple effects are disastrous jetblue also has four local flights such as fort lauderdale to jacksonville and jacksonville back to the fort lauderdale and fort lauderdale to cuba and cuba back to fort lauderdale flight number 17 18 1499 and 1500 and for the past 4 days each of them have been delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours with two of them being canceled all together and weather really has nothing to do with it since april 15th the weather has been fine down here we have had very little rain but even the four local flights which are only about an hour and 20 minutes apart also been delayed 3 to 6 hours or have been canceled about a year ago jetblue stated to the public that they will have fewer frequency of flights which will allow them more flexibility when things go wrong but obviously that is not the case

9053,eurowings,5,i wont complain,short hop on this airline belonging to the lufthansa group basically not really worse than flying with many european airlines who claim to be premium letting you anyway pay for food drinks seats luggage etc so i wont complain eurowings is a low cost airline crew was joyful and cabin presented well even if the seat pitch at the back of the plane isnt great pay for food is reasonably priced and the crew handled the process efficiently love eurowings boarding concept two groups priority with those having booked a fare including a larger cabin luggage and normal boarding for those with standard hand luggage
6526,cathay dragon,7,smooth and flexible service,shanghai to hong kong the flight delayed about 70min due to air traffic control at hkia and process out of order allocating boarding gates at shanghai hongqiao international airport but the crews tried to provide a smooth and flexible service the mealsto be sure were not enough when it comes to the portioneven as refreshment and the chicken noodles looked less tasty but after all tasted well due to turbulence on air the service operated a bit slowly but enough
6553,cathay dragon,7,reasonable regional business class,shanghai to hong kong a reasonable regional business class offering seats are nothing special in a 2x2x2 layout with minimal recline and space but are sufficient for a short range business class flight generally cathay dragon aircraft are old and this was no exception with this particular a330 being 21 years old crew were friendly and attentive and food selection was ok i feel that cathay dragon is very middle of the road in terms of what it offers at the front end of the cabin
234,aer lingus,1,absolutely shocking service,absolutely shocking service if i ran my company the way they did id be out of business our flight was due to leave at 1805 they waited until 1825 to say the flight was cancelled and couldnt get us on another flight until the following day we were then told to head back to baggage collection to collect our cases and proceed to checkin to arrange the hotel this would have been straightforward if they hadnt made us wait 25 hours to get our bags back we then had to make our way to the hotel most of that was guess work only to find out our so called food voucher wasnt available for use in any of the hotel restaurants they tried to palm us off with either fish or curry in a separate room and it wasnt being served until after 2130 travelling with children this really isnt a fair deal we were then informed we had been transferred onto the 0630 flight the following morning i mean come on not eating until after 2130 with children then trying to sort cases etc and be up for 0330 the following morning to make the flight absolute joke to make things even more hilarious my friend was travelling on the aer lingus flight to glasgow around the same time we were due to fly they were 20 mins from landing and they turned back due to a technical fault so travelling back 40 minutes was safer than the 20 mins to glasgow clearly they dont want to have a plane stranded in glasgow as it would cost more than the inconvenience to the full flight of passengers
17719,scoot,1,avoid for longer flights,i wouldnt recommend this airline for a long trip to anyone it was the worst long trip of my life i had to take 2 flights with scoot from manila to berlin with stop in singapore the first one manila to singapore was just a couple of hours so it was ok although it arrived delayed so i had to run to catch my connection the second flight from singapore to berlin should last 13 hours i thought this plane would be much bigger an comfortable than the one before but it was exactly as bad it could fit more passengers but everything was exactly as narrow i would get no pillow no blanket no screen with movies no food not even a glass of water i never experienced something like this on an intercontinental flight i thought it was not even allowed you could of course buy something but totally overprice like a small cola for 5 euros honestly low cost has gone too far the seats were as small as the ones of a 2 hours ryanair flight but for 13 hours in addition it was so unfortunate that i had to sit in the very last row in which you couldnt put the chair back not even just 1 cm it was almost unbearable to be 13 hours sitting like this and with no refreshments for a short 23 hours flight might be ok to use them but if you can avoid this airline for longer flights do it by all means
1884,air india express,5,a budget flight but with a high fare,mostly prices are high even in nonpeak times i planned to travel may 2023 but the price was more than 1000 aed for a oneway flight from dxbshj to trz this is a budget flight but with a high fare
14522,malindo air,2,recommend using another airline,perth to kuala lumpur malindo cancelled our return flight kl to perth at short notice causing us 4 days additional hotel food and extra leave from unhappy employers who served verbal notice malindos response they dont care no compensation for our losses recommend using another airline
19738,tam airlines,3,tam airlines customer review,appalling customer service we fly all over the world and had booked our business class flights via sao paulo however one leg of the journey was in economy as there was no availability of business class on advice of the airline we booked a seat with extra leg room and made the payment a few weeks later we were told those seats may no longer be available and they would not be able to tell us until the actual day of the journey moreover we would not be automatically be reimbursed unless requested it is unbelievable that you do not get an automatic pay back where a service is not offered by the company i am horrified at the lack of professionalism
1604,air europa,2,avoid at all cost,we booked and paid online we arrive 2 hors before departure before being told we were on standby reason was a massive overbooking the plane was delayed by 130 hours we waited again to be told no one deemed overbooked will board we has to retrieve our luggage to start again the staff didnt understand the sky team highest status saying there was no business class on the flight try to explain the difference between a priority status and a seat class to a wall was easier avoid at all cost
10705,gulf air,8,trips are almost always smooth,gulf air is really not a bad airline when traveling regionally within gcc for me they are always on time the trips are almost always smooth from take off to landing service is great and i would definitely fly with them again the only drawback is the price of the ticket tends to be steep compared to other airlines like emirates
11479,intercaribbean airways,9,crew were professional and polite,we must be extremely lucky but our two flights with intercaribbean on different routes and different dates were both fantastic last week we fly from saint vincent to barbados we started and arrived early same this week from barbados to grenada we were up and landing in no time our bags made it super quick the crew were professional and polite for flights lasting barely 30 minutes we did not expect either entertainment or service so it was all as expected the only thing is that given that we purchased tickets a couple of days before trip date they were quite expensive i guess they are a great company for interisland flights but one should not buy connecting flights to elsewhere for the same day
18279,singapore airlines,9,a decent experience,a decent experience check in was fast and easy lounge was comfortable with good food offerings boarding was slightly chaotic but not awful the aircraft is wonderful with comfortable seating and leg room ife was good meal decent for a two hour flight had to ask for an amenity kit flight was basically on time not stellar but better than most wifi wasnt working
16659,regent airways,7,seats were good pitch,dhaka to coxs baza booked a discounted ticket more than a month ago didnt expect too much just on time departure arrival thats what i got boarding luggage handling was smooth cabin crew wasnt exactly cordial but professional enough it was a 40min ride but the captain was able to make it bumpy despite clear weather cheese sandwich cake was good enough for a shorts haul flight like this but as expected no ife aircraft was manufactured in 2001 so common for local bangladeshi carriers but the seats were good pitch even for a dutch national who flew alongside me was well over 6 hope for a similar experience with regent next time
7022,china southern airlines,8,pleasantly surprised and satisfied,i was pleasantly surprised and satisfied with this journey with china southern airlines from guangzhou on 19april they tried their best to find my lost visa documents in time and help me to get my plane smoothly the attendants on board are very welcoming and the facilities on plane is quite new we landed on time without delays
20931,trigana air,8,aircraft was clean and cool,jayapura to tanahmerah flight left and arrived on time aircraft was clean and cool crew friendly and even a simple inflight meal of a box of tea and a cake was provided
22864,wow air,1,never fly this airline again,i will never fly this airline again the ground service was horrible from london to keflavik when we checked in the person at the wow counter to us we would have to pay for luggage which we thought we did but didnt keep the paper work so she said it wasnt her problem then she told us it wasnt her problem that we didnt read the website with all the fees when we got inline to board the plane we realized that she put my spouse at the front of the plane and i was at the back in the long run after paying an extra 36000 just for two small carry on bags it is just not worth it also on the 6 hour flight back we didnt have usb plugs to charge ipad or phone no entertainment and crazy priced food and drinks you couldnt even get water for free really check out other airlines as in the longer run the cheaper fairs will add up
11826,japan airlines,1,following indications by the japanese embassy,i was supposed to fly from tokyo to barcelona via paris cdg through international path no need to get in french eu or schengen territory at any point as it was clearly stated when purchasing the flight i had chosen precisely this airline and route because it was one of the easiest in terms of transfer and covid restrictions since my final destination spain had no requirement for vaccination or any type of test and the french authorities and cdg site stated that there were no conditions for transferring through the airport on arrival at the checking counter at narita airport jal staff asked me for my documents and my pcr test results to what i replied that they were not needed to get to spain they didnt know about the spanish conditions and were confused from the beginning after discussing among the team and calling different people on the phone they informed me that they were requiring the pcr in order to fly because they knew of someone that got rejected to transfer in paris without pcr they proceeded to suggest that i changed my route to go through helsinki and london when i had to inform them myself that the route was not possible since the uk was for sure requiring a pcr in order to transfer at their airports i showed the manager the official french government and airport sites explaining that pcr was not needed for someone transferring in cdg showed that air france was not requiring pcr for me to fly to spain all these took approximately 4 hours and the only response i got was that jal was following indications by the japanese embassy in france and that on their site they suggested that everyone had a pcr in order to transfer in france i was offered to change my flight for the following day under the condition of getting a pcr test i did get my pcr test and returned to the airport the following day hoping that with some time they would have had time and the decency to at least check and apologize for the mistake nonetheless i found myself with the same response that the japanese embassy in france was suggesting a pcr so they were right to force me to get one this whole situation generated a very bad experience and affected my trust in jal
6653,cathay pacific airways,1,not waive the cancellation fee,perth to osaka via hong kong due to corona virus many airlines are cancelling flights to hong kong and waiving cancellation and rebooking fees cathay pacific however will not waive the cancellation fee they are essentially forcing me to fly through hong kong on my way to and from japan risking my health and putting me in a position where i might not be let back into australia if i choose to cancel i have to pay 500 in cancellation fees its an absolute joke cathay pacific is a hong kong based company and this is where most of their business is they are risking peoples health and livelihood by not waiving these cancellation fees who can afford to just waste 500 for nothing i phoned several different representatives to explain my situation they are all drones who repeat the same thing and when i eventually got put through to a manager i was on hold for an hour before they disconnected the call they are waiving the rebooking fees however which almost makes it worse they are admitting there is a problem but then not allowing people to cancel their flights i cannot rebook my flight as there are no available flights which get me to where i need to go without travelling through hong kong whoever has made this decision is thinking about their business only and not the safety and well being of their customers
2902,air tahiti nui,6,staff really nice and kind,paris to papeete via los angeles new plane which is nice but actually less comfy the older planes where on a 242 seats setup newer are on a 333 setup which give you less room on your seat food is okay poor choice of entertainment but great staff really nice and kind
9663,flair airlines,1,im not able checkin online,flair airlines is one of the most disgusting airlines i have experienced i booked the flight online and im not able checkin online and i have to go to the customer service agent hundreds of people were lined up there where i have to wait for more than two hours to get the boarding pass the boarding pass they gave was after the time has already passed the flight was on april 10 at 6 am and they gave the boarding pass on 607 am but faked as if they gave me on 515 am which i noticed later i asked them how it can be possible and they told me to just go to a16 telling me that they are still waiting for passengers finally when me and dozen of passengers arrived there the flight has already departed i have been calling them for more three hours in case i can get my refund but no one is there to answer
10101,frontier airlines,1,appalled at the behavior of the staff,im absolutely appalled at the behavior of the staff on board we havent even departed and i have heard the flight attendance talk negatively about the attendant welcoming guests boarding speak rudely to a handicapped guest trying to place their crutches and then discuss in front of me whether i flushed a toilet that i didnt use while i was in the bathroom to take my medication in private prior to entering the bathroom one attendant shared how much she hate this plane what on earth is so wrong with this company that they would allow these humans to be in charge of these passengers most of them seemingly do not care about anyone but themselves its truly a disgrace
8158,druk air,8,nice hot lunch served,flight departed early warm welcome by fa in business cabin nice hot lunch served on first segment between delhi and kathmandu printed menus new signature predeparture drink offered clean airy cabin regular updates from captain as usual spectacular landing in paro
4648,asiana airlines,2,worst business class trip,this is the worst business class trip i have taken flight delayed by 2 hours when we take off no proper catering options just given a tray of unrecognisable western dish chicken and then asked if want to order the dinner meal before arrival a choice of scrambled egg or porridge who eats breakfast for dinner staff were polite but the cabin was too hot and the entertainment selection is appalling
19711,tam airlines,3,tam airlines customer review,terrible business lounge in sao paulo no wifi awful cold food not good sandwiches and uncomfortable seats harsh lighting once youre on the flight inattentive staff uncomfortable seats not good food and youre lucky if you get a glass of wine in the first 2 hours i wont be flying with them again make ba look like saints
9314,fiji airways,4,cancelled because of cyclone,nadi to singapore flight got cancelled because of cyclone which is understandable however no news from the airlines for the next 36h on a new flight no compensation or accommodation because it was outside of their control called in more than 5 times was put on hold only to be hung up after waiting patiently for 15h no customer service plane food was average at best only one meat option and they only offered chicken seats have decent leg room but are cushions are thin inair entertainment is ok but screens on the plane are tiny and quality is terrible
7315,comair,8,great service and good food,johannesburg to windhoek return checked in at terminal b domestic british airways sa however the flight departs from terminal a which is about a 10 minute walk away security was okay immigration a little slow these flights are operated by comair but marketed as a british airways franchise service used the slow lounge which is very good with a good food drink selection coffee bar and food to order if required boarding from a25 on to a bus aircraft a pretty old 737400 but clean and tidy seat 2a offers lots of space a similar lay out to ba european flights departed on time once in the air service from a nice crew was very good food drinks pretty good i was the only pax in business class so very nice experience arrival on time however the dreadfully slow immigration at wdh lasted 2 hours with a huge que from 3 arriving flights return check in was polite and quick however security immigration was rude and an absolute shambles not the airlines fault used the local lounge which was quiet but offered nothing no wifi either boarded the aircraft from gate 2 a short walk to the steps departed around 30 minutes late again an old but well kept 737400 seat 1a offered enough space for this 2hr flight a full cabin this time but great service and good food offering pretty relaxing flight
17795,seaborne airlines,5,double charged my credit card,seaborne double charged my credit card in january 2019 for a booking i have been reaching out to seabourne airlines via telephone via emails and i visited their reservations counter in puerto rico since mid january 2019 without success to date no one has contacted me or provided any information regarding the above mentioned double payment all i have been receiving is an automatic email response wish is unsatisfactory it is unfair to me to have to incur credit card fees because of a mistake made by seabourne airlines
10533,go first,7,courteous cabin crew,lcc so fly with low expectations and experience would be good on time departure and arrival boarding experience ok what can airlines do when people are desperate to board breaking the queue clean and fresh cabin ok seats for short journeys courteous cabin crew snacks and beverages on sale on board if wants sandwich or something like that need to book during booking

21783,virgin america,4,scuffed and damaged suitcase,orlando to los angeles the service started out fine in fact most of it was exceptional excluding a few delays in getting to my gate in time i do have a few minor problems with how my flight went and the care given to my luggage though the smallest detail that got on my nerves was the fact that everything had to be paid by card so if youre on a six hour flight with cash make sure you eat before they did give complimentary drinks once during the flight but thats all another little bug is that they had a very small selection of pretty much everything entertainmentwise and foodwise again these are just small tweaks that made my flight the tiniest bit worse but the most important thing i mentioned was the care given to my luggage arriving at baggage claim i found my suitcase scuffed and covered in black ink spots the person i was traveling with also recieved a very scuffed and damaged suitcase although older and not as costly
1840,air india,2,horrible service by air india,we 3 people 2 adults and 1 child were travelling from london to kochi via delhi we missed the flight 4am from delhi to kochi because of our child was continuously vomiting and it was early morning 4am flight but we reached airport little late 410am they failed to arrange alternate flight for us and they told us to book new seats they said you will get email after some time as pnr is generated no issue we trusted them and returned back to hotel we didnt receive the email at all and we contacted the costumer service they also said its okay just go to airport and get the boarding pass we went to airport little early 2am with all our luggage and child when we arrived they said that in your name no seats book and all seats are full we cannot help you we showed pnr number they said but as you didnt get email we cant do anything we went to manager of the air india she didnt show any interest in helping or solving the issue we checked with other airlines they had 2 seats one seat like that so we had to book new tickets again with vistara next day morning 3am and we returned back to hotel again with all our bags 25kg bags hand luggage and child horrible service by air india horrible staff members and irresponsible non cooperative they were all laughing making fun of each other and customers no seriousness and no helping nature it all happened in delhi international airport as we were confused and standing what to do we were just observing them they are so careless even for old people who are approaching them and they dont know the language hindi or english they are very careless they are not there for helping others they are not serious about their job

856,air astana,6,review cabin crew training,almaty to istanbul please review your cabin crew training program kc 911 on 1706 delayed for 30 mins actually there were at least 3 flights which were delayed around of this time ground staff of air astana did excellent work even though it was crowded they handle situation professionally 5 star to ground staff except of one thing lady on the checkin counter told me that there is no delay of the flight when actually it was a delay for 30 mins i mean not a big deal and most probably delay wasnt announced to staff at that moment but fact is fact i would rather spend 30 mins with my beloved ones instead of crowded transit area if you can call almaty airport hall a transit area real bad experience starting with announcement of the flight not sure whose fault it is airport or airline but should be sorted you can not hear what staff announced it is simply hard to understand about which flight she was talking about sound had a really bad quality waiting area was crowded and too loud almaty airport is very old and small it should be replaced a long time ago the reason why im leaving this comment are cabin crew seriously guys you need to review your politics and training program as a constant customer you can see how quality is going down if supervisors and business class crew are still on track your junioreconomy staff is losing a mark crew was rude they commanded to do procedures before take off and when customers who may never flew before looked for explanation the answers were very sharp and again rude crew responded with single words time to time mixing it with russian and it was obvious that it was hard for them to express themselves in single sentence they gave an option of two meals as usual chicken and beef however during serving crew literally served us without asking anything when someone noticed that they would prefer beef crew responded that she would prefer beef as well but what is left is left same crew complained that she has to wait for customers when all of them visit restroom and because of what she is not able to serve the rest who were keep calling her
4530,arik air,7,arik air customer review,have flown several times between lagos domestic old terminal and warri flights on time and flight attendants attentive and friendly be warned that youll have to hunt down your gate at lagos if you want to be sure of catching your flight its not unusual for staff to just wander off for no announcements to be made and for passengers to be running across the runway at the last minute with their baggage in hand on one occasion a dutch wetlease service was used from warri to lagos older but it was a comfortable plane with one dutch and one nigerian fa both friendly and professional the safety briefing was even done a second time as one passenger point blank refused to pay attention the first time and wouldnt remove their earphones food onboard constituted a carton of five alive juice and either a pain au chocolate or the standard nigerian mystery meat pasty good luck with that one security at warri as corrupt as anywhere else in nigeria despite the airport being funded by shell dont expect any special attention if you work for them though here they are particularly aggressive rather than the usual passive begging
6569,cathay dragon,5,general sense of downgrading,hong kong to kuala lumpur cathay pacific is no longer flying to kuala lumpur and is replaced by its regional recently rebranded cathay dragon previously dragonair i must there is general sense of downgrading in terms of food quality inflight service the mains were really poor in portions and quality and no plain water offered unless you asked for it reminded me of budget airlines like airasia i have always flown cathay pacific business class but this time round decided to try out the economy on cathay dragon and the difference is pretty obvious cabin crew were not as attentive and seemed to rush through their rounds i will consider mas in my next trip
15439,oman air,3,no one in the customer service office,slow response of the staff and no one at frankfurt airport in the customer service office i have a connecting flight from ams and it was very tight in time in the end i missed my flight and luggage dont really recommend it
9625,flair airlines,1,dont care about their passengers time,i agree with one of the reviews they dont care about their passengers time our flight was delayed for more than 5 hours they said it was for passengers safety they need to do maintenance thats a lie probably there flight is not full so they moved it to a later time we need to go to toronto just for 3 days thats why we got the latest flight so well get to toronto by 1am the next day take a few hours rest then start our day but because of this our tight schedule is even tighter now their website said that youll be compensated for the meal or hotel accommodations but when i try to fill out their compensation form theres no option for it just rebook or refund i was hoping to atleast get a nice hotel room while waiting for more than 5 hours so we can rest comfortably and near the airport their checked baggage is so expensive as well as their hand carry
13199,kuwait airways,1,wait another 15 hours,new york jfk to kuwait it was just little bit raining thats why they cancel flight we were waiting more than 5 hours then they cancel the flight i have to wait another 15 hours for the next flight what should i do now since i live very far away from jfk and they didnt even offer for hotel

4388,ana all nippon airways,9,fas were fantastic attentive polite,ana boards in groups and aisle seat passengers board last ie group 5 fas were fantastic attentive polite treated everyone well the premium economy cabin is laid out in a 2x4x2 seating and i was on the aisle 26d be aware that c d and h seats on the 777 have an entertainment box limiting your leg space but in because the width of the seat is wider so it wasnt too bad but just annoying the flight was punctual and everything ran smoothly ife was available and featured movies in english but had an extensive japanese menu there were no english tv shows only japanese tv serials my food was awful the main course was very small and very salty and not well presentedit was an odd mix of cold soba noodles a sushi roll with edamame a bun with butter and a salad usually japanese style potato salad with mayonnaise they handed out a half sandwich halfway through the flight egg salad and drinks were offered regularly the wine selection was dreadful and my sparkling wine undrinkable we were offered eye masks toothbrushes and earplugs everyone had a pair of slippers and earphones in their seat there was a blanket and pillow but the plane was too hot for use of the blanket the staff responded promptly to calls and all requests and i was impressed with them they are way better than sq and gives sq a run for its money after a 2 hour wait in narita boarded the 787 for kul again a smooth journey food offerings again small salty and a confusing mix of japanese and western on a tray note that food offerings in pe is same as economy and their website says they provide pe passengers with a business class dessert but that never appeared however we were served hagen das ice cream which was welcome i would highly recommend this airline for punctuality and attentive staff but bring some snacks and avoid their wines
3154,airasia,1,we will fly with you again,all went quickly and even before time we were almost late checking our bag they packed the plane and we landed ahead of time cannot complain because it is rare that airlines run their operations ahead of time no service but we knew about it so no complaints point a to point b all went well the pilot was very nice informing us when kota kinabalu will pop on the horizon so we were ready and got some great photos of the beautiful mountain weather cooperated as well thank you and we will fly with you again

15268,norwegian,3,made a mistake in a booking,copenhagen to tel aviv norwegian used to be my favorite airline but i made a mistake in a booking called to change it and was advised to cancel the ticket and claim for a refund i did that and was told a refund was not possible and a change of booking was also not possible due to the cancellation of the ticket numerous approaches to their service department were met with the same robotic response that ignored my comments and used a sorry for any inconvenience template what a shame and disappointment
12807,kenya airways,1,staff very unhelpful and dismissive,the most horrible customer experience i have ever had with an airline i have ended up being charged triple the original price i paid despite the fact that i called the customer contact center day before flight issued with last minute information to rebook my flight 15 hours before the flight i dont think i have anything nice to say about my experience dont think i can recommend the airline to another airport staff very unhelpful and dismissive and dont think i will ever consider to use the airline ever again
345,aeroflot russian airlines,9,very polite and helpful,warsaw to moscow return standard in economy class is better than in lh or lot we got a tasty sandwich apple and choco wafel for drink selection of juices tea coffee were served in moscow free newspapers and magazines the aircraft was extremely clean flight attendants were very polite and helpful and very well organized however the aircraft was near full ground service in moscow is organized better than in eg cdg or lyon in all airports you have to wait in the lines for passport control it usually takes about 20 30 minutes but in waw was 20 also from the airport is a very comfortable train to the center
12341,jetstar airways,4,complaining about their seat size,i am complaining about their seat size they must be the smallest narrowest economy seats of any airline to be squashed up for 9 hours is horrible they are an extremely budget airline you cant even get a pillow the flight was ok and on time
649,afriqiyah airways,3,afriqiyah airways customer review,dubai tripoli dakar all in all the flight experience was a pleasure with very good food good seat space and regular drinks the spare seat next to me also helped it was also good not to have the flight constantly interrupted by announcements of one kind or another in three different languages as seems to be the trend these days tripoli airport isnt a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than i am used to on the bigger planes two big faults though firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people no apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived though they said they were just about to also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying very cheap and comfortable
5908,boutique air,1,boutique air is always delayed,this airline is a huge scam every single flight is delayed or cancelled we lost 2 days of vacation to start with because after our luggage was not transferred from our aa flight to air boutique they put it on the next flight the next flights kept being delayed and then finally cancelled for 24 hours on the way back the same they delayed the flight first of one hour then two hours so we lost our following flight boutique air is always delayed
7089,china southern airlines,9,we were assisted by ground staff,i was a little worried about the recent epidemic in guangdong the temperature in guangzhou was 37 degrees and we saw no less than 50 china southern staff customs and border control officers waiting for us in protective clothing after disembarking from the plane we were placed in our seats to wait for the epidemiological investigation while we waited we were assisted by ground staff to check our customs declaration after the investigation we were guided through the sampling process i was reassured by the social distance that needed to be maintained at each step of the process and the fact that everyone was seen to be disinfected when they left their seats i would also like to thank one of the staff at china southern airlines when i got to the sampling area i realised that my ipad left it on the plane she saw me rummaging through it and asked if i needed any help i was grateful for her help as the ipad contained important documents for my work
8773,ernest airlines,1,extortion of money for luggage,kiev to bologna aggressive policy on extortion of money for luggage my claim is mainly because they do not properly notify about the fact that they do not allow holding any small objects in hands which normally are allowed in the cabin by other airlines i had only one small backpack as hand luggage and my suit which is whatever but definitely not the second hand luggage they forced me to pay and give my backpack to the baggage normally the airlines do not consider mans suit in a soft case as an additional hand luggage and the crew hangs it the cabin but instead i had to put in the shelf and finally my tripod which was tied up to the backpack was lost i think it is stolen and this is the responsibility of the company it would not be stolen if it was in the cabin under my control i wrote my claims to the company and didnt get satisfaction
18840,spicejet,9,inflight experience is wonderful,ground staff and customer service staff are very helpful and supportive inflight experience is wonderful and spice max facilities are an added advantage thank you and keep up the good work
7007,china eastern airlines,8,pleasantly surprised,beijing to yinchuan heard mixed reviews of china eastern airlines but was pleasantly surprised comfortable seats with ample legroom plane was new and looked brilliant in the silver skyteam livery food was decent although i noticed that they dont offer a drink selection and only give passengers a bottle of water in terms of ife you cant expect much when flying within china except a movie or show being shown on the overhead monitors i was asleep for most of the flight and was pleased with how smooth the ride was all in all a good experience
23052,xl airways france,9,xl airways france customer review,we traveled from jfk to paris the flight was on time the staff more than friendly our baggage was over and didnt charge us a dime extra each of my 3 children were entertained by movies tv shows or music that was provided by individual screens the food was nothing but typical airline food really what do you expect eat a good meal prior to your flight we arrived on time as for as charging for water that is ludicrous they walked around the entire time offering water our experience on the way back was exactly the same very satisfied i would save the money and use it for your destination
17384,s7 siberia airlines,5,the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm,i flew to kazan from moscow domodedovo for a weekend visit on s7 airlines on 10 and 12 february 2017 flying domestically within russia is very inexpensive so it is affordable for many people the result is that both flights were at capacity boarding was late on both flights starting at the time the gate was supposed to close according to the ticket schedule as with other russian airlines there is no preboarding or boarding by zones once the gate opens it is a rush to board it is important to board early on a budget airline like s7 because with bag charges everyone tries to carry on as much as possible and the overhead compartments fill quickly despite the chaotic boarding both flights departed close to schedule on both flights the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm for me but if you live in russia you know that russians like it warm very warm i sat in economy and although i dont consider myself tall at 180 cm my knees were pressed up against the seat in front of me absolutely no leg room at all if you are taller than i am you will be very uncomfortable see my photo it was a short flight only about 90 minutes the flight attendants were very businesslike and focused on getting the passengers a meal and drinks in the short time we were airborne a bland sandwich and your choice of water at cabin temperature or hot tea was what you got more than one would expect on a short flight but not very high quality i would have preferred just a cold beverage to cool me off in the warm stuffy cabin in the end the flight was what you would expect for 8000 rubles 138 usd not great but what do you expect
8947,etihad airways,2,service poor,we were very disappointed by the following seats very cramped when queuing for the toilet you felt you were imposing on peoples personal space service poor we waited for over two hours for some water our wine with dinner on all flights never appeared on each journey we only had one drink bearing in mind our flights were all over 11hrs the inflight entertainment system didnt work on our last flight the only things available was bbc world news and a few games the food selection was poor and often ran out on one flight both meals had bland dry pasta for the vegetarian option the vegetarian curry option on another flight was actually very tasty we will not be booking with airline again and have advised friends and family to avoid
18711,south african airways,4,most of the time above average,johannesburg to lusaka to be fair most of the time saa flights are above average this time round was not one of them my qatar airways flight was delayed in doha i spent over two hours on my mobile trying to change my flight for the next day cant wait to see the bill and nothing was resolved i spoke to four different people each time having to start at the beginning of my story only to be told i have to visit an saa office pretty hard when you are in doha and they dont have an office there at the end it cost me the same price as the ticket to have it changed once i got to johannesburg airport once on board we taxied to the runway only to turn back and park for close on three hours due to a technical fault we were not allowed to disembark as i said to be fair this is the first delay i have encountered after 40 or so flights
3566,airbaltic,2,inconsistent customer experience,riga to oslo very poor and inconsistent customer experience was told at the departure airport that my hand luggage would be fine and quicker as i had short transits since i was eligible for checked in baggage but didnt have any then got charged at the gate of riga airport
21425,ural airlines,6,crew were polite,yekaterinburg to novosibirsk with ural airlines they made me check my carry on bag for no reason as aircraft was half empty this caused a 30 minute wait in ovb in a terrible bggage area no wc crowded the flight boarded on time but we sat 30 minutes past departure time without any explanation a minute before we finally pushed back the pilot said something in russian i understood one word cargo so the delay was probably related to that however no english version for the reason after takeoff we were served a sandwich with drinks which was ok crew were polite and spoke english no ife of any sort seems to be the norm in russia im flying aeroflot tomorrow and hoping for a surprise with the ife bussed from aircraft to terminal in freezing cold 20c while many jetways stood empty but they must had their operational reasons
13759,liat,8,liat customer review,check in was orderly for the 0945 sunday flight to trinidads port of spain with boarding commencing on time we took off punctually and crew were polite and friendly handing out boarding cards there was no drinks service on this flight landing on time and disembarkation prompt we made it into the terminal building in time a pleasant uneventful experience
5810,blue1,5,blue1 customer review,fly blue1 twice a year from stockholm arlanda to vassa the other reviews are right about the plane noise it is pretty loud with a prop plane but the fact that it was 2x1 plus the seats were blue leather and larger than normal than made up for it
10261,garuda indonesia,6,a sharp decline,jakarta to bali in the past i was amazed by the development of garuda indonesia but what i saw and felt the quality of garuda indonesia airlines experienced a sharp decline i can feel it when i receive a different quality of service from the previous 2 years such as providing food ticket prices and airport services for me at this time garuda indonesia is not worthy of getting a 5star airline award
7044,china southern airlines,9,handled the upgrade at the counter,this is my first trip since covid19 in order to make the trip more comfortable i handled the upgrade at the counter the price is very favorable the staff are also very professional and they also provide a lounge there are hot food and drinks in the lounge the service food and drink on board were also excellent after arriving at incheon airport the helpful staff came to talk with us and told me the entry precautions there was no problem with customs and immigration
1852,air india,5,disappointed that i never got to fly,boarding was on time took my seat and relaxed with a glass of champagne announcement was made we have a tech issue and power was turned off after approx 20min had to deboard then after 5hrs waiting in the gate lounge they announced that the flight was cancelled another hour waiting i was finally rebooked onto emirates and sent to a hotel for a few hours all played for by ia so disappointed that i never got to fly
21226,turkish airlines,5,not chose this airline anymore,turkish airkines still does have real business class seats on european flights boarding in istanbul was a rush a non alcoholic welcome aboard drink was offered however my food in business class was sub par extremely dry chicken with some rice the wines and the alcoholic drinks were extremely basic it was an afternoon flight however fa found it appropriate to dimm the cabin lights until 15 minutes before landing i do not like to travel during daytime in a darkened cabin the fa doing the business section were extremely friendly i will not chose this airline anymore
11281,iberia express,3,not worth the upgrade,madrid to krakow poor business class service for the money paid i upgraded to business class cabin on my flight to get more comfort and more space the boarding service in madrid was confusing with various lines upon boarding i was offered an orange juicethe seat is not very comfortable and did not recline the meal was bad i received cheese crackers oliver piece of chorizo some potatoes and grapefruit for a business class experience this was below par the flight attendant was nice and was the best part of the trip she returned the bag i left on the aircraft and ran after me to give it back very nice the toilet was quite dirty and there was no soap left all in all not worth the upgrade food needs improvement and the cleanliness levels need to get better
17948,shenzhen airlines,4,shenzhen airlines customer review,flew shenzhen to beijing capital on boeing 737900 whilst i guess its quite a new plane the interior was quite grubby with surface stains and scratches to panels and seat areas the flight was delayed due to traffic but thats normal in china lounge at shenzhen airport in need of further change if they want to meet international standards as its geared to chinese only staff onboard were quite efficient but language skills very poor and didnt understand anything that appears to not be on their script a bit scary food is also geared of course to chinese passengers and wasnt good even by chinese standards theres not a lot of options for this route but will go back to using hainan airlines whenever i can for domestic as they are miles ahead of all the other airlines here
6816,china airlines,2,there was no one to help me,once in the ground in sfo despite many assurances there was no one to help me and without assistance i was unable to make my connecting flight to seattle when i asked staff at sfo about this they said ill talk to my supervisor and did nothing just like they did when i touched down at sfo the staff member helping me upon seeing i was upset told me that i did it wrong that he was at the baggage carrousel and that if id have gotten help it might have been different he told me the plane was on time it landed on time then sat on the tarmac for ten minutes then no one helped me he was exceedingly rude and i told him if he couldnt help me he shouldnt have kept me waiting 30 minutes to tell me that he flipped me off after yelling at me
21461,us airways,4,us airways customer review,very frustrating experience with gate attendant mandating the checking of bags at the gate when overhead space still available caused the inability to take original delayed flight through dc and delaying arrival by hours delays happen just wish guest service from this airline could provide recovery
3346,airasia philippines,2,they rejected the refund,airasia calcelled my flight from bali to the philippines because of covid19 i was promised to get a refund for this specific cancellation after waiting for it for 4 months they rejected the refund even tho it was even promised on their website so now i dont get refunded nor i get credits and lost 200 for a flight that never went up in the air plus it is impossible to contact airasia in any way accept for the automatic ava
5961,breeze airways,8,will definitely fly breeze air again,i usually dont write reviews but because of all the negative reviews for breeze airlines i had to write one i was very skeptical because of all the bad reviews but a non stop flight is what i wanted and was willing to take the chance glad i did no issues what so ever flight was on time plane was clean the only negative thing i can think of i flew regular class which you only got free water had to purchase snacks and drinks not a huge deal also there was only 1 flight to choose from i will definitely fly breeze air again
19612,taag angola airlines,5,overpriced for the quality,i flew taag angola airlines from luanda to cape town and windhoek to luandathe flights were okay nothing really bad my complaint is that it was overpriced for the quality of the flight the planes for both legs were clean although cabins were not well maintained the service on board was abysmal there were no courtesy from the fas the toilets were run out of toilet papers and were dirty but fas didnt bother to clean them up the food were just for survival would i recommend this airline no however i doubt there is competition for the route so you might end up taking this airline
20935,tropic air belize,9,great little airline,best staff ever great little airline we did 5 flights in all every one on time staff super friendly and helpful we connected in belize and got through immigration much faster than expected they put us on an earlier flight and even called our hotel to pick us up early excellent service planes are small propeller type so no real in flight service or drinks etc also note no toilets on board flight from cancun took an hour and a half so worth keeping in mind they use the private fbo terminal in cancun airport so make sure your taxi knows that when going to the airport all in all super friendly everything was on time these are small planes but all were smooth even through dark clouds very well organised ground staff a pleasant change from flying through big terminals on big airlines
2045,air koryo,6,air koryo customer review,flew fnjpek last week handling on ground smooth and efficient accepting a couple of kgs more weight than allowed without even a question aircraft clean and modern service friendly and with a smile both on the ground and in the air ok catering and a good choice of drinks given the short leg of just 15 hrs flight time on time flight i guess the bad rating comes from the old air koryo operating but since a while both their equipment and their attitude has changed strongly and its another carrier now
10310,georgian airways,2,flying was like 25 years ago,tiblisi to gatwick ive already written one review of georgian airways which was submitted prior to my first flight with them but ive now returned from tbilisi id say that if you want a taste of what flying was like 25 years ago then georgian is your best bet there is no ife no choice of menu unsmiling stewardhostess service and unintelligible safety and pilot announcements on the plus side leg room is good and both flights were on time but there is nothing special or even average about the service and the airline which would make me recommend them to anyone the head office service is no better than the cabin service so it took numerous phone calls after arriving in georgia as well as a one hour visit to their head office to sort out arrangements for alternative inbound flights as referred to in my first review no one replied to our emails and facebook messages and no one returned any of our calls despite promising to do so
17830,shaheen air,9,shaheen air customer review,19 nov 2012 flight from peshawar to jeddah aircraft was b737800 scheduled takeoff was 5am but it eventually took off at 6am total trip 3hrs flight food was good inflight entertainment was not available
14742,meridiana,6,meridiana customer review,olbblq on md80 seats cramped but fine for a short flight service was one drink coke orange juice or water no snack the biggest gripe with meridiana is that they charge high fares but are in practice a nofrills airline on a number of domestic routes you even need to pay extra for checked baggage as it is the case with low cost carriers they have a sort of monopoly in olbia so you dont have much choice
17412,s7 siberia airlines,4,s7 siberia airlines customer review,domedovochelyabinsk return first time with s7 all fights on time on all legs very smart aircraft clean and comfortable lots of leg room in economy courteous staff though not much english food excellent
8988,etihad airways,5,3 hours of mediocrity,beirut to abu dhabi in economy 3 hours of mediocrity the seat is pretty thin and comes without any kind of screen for personal entertainment you can watch movies via the onboard streaming system but the seat does not feature any kind of support for your smartphone i ordered a lowcalorie meal which was ok but too much plastic is being used starting from the cutlery some crew members looked annoyed by passenger requests plane was a 7 yearold a321 which was clean and in great condition out of the gulf carriers and turkish airlines etihad provides the worst product in economy class on a narrow body plane
10448,germanwings,3,germanwings customer review,flew back from cologne on the 10th december flight returned after 20 minutes due to technical faults attempted to reboard 2 hours and 10 minutes after original flight time but was told catering being loaded onto replacement thus further delay meaning flight delayed to 3 hrs 15 mins no complaint forms as promised no non eu passenger cards given not a budget airline at 327 for 2 return tickets from lhr best avoided the rep in cologne treated the whole episode as a joke
8251,easyfly,8,helpful and professional,palonegro to cucuta with easyfly was put on this flight after satena cancelled one of the legs i was hesitant since i had to make it to cuc that day the js41 are quite small yet efficient planes easyfly ground staff at palonegro was quite helpful and professional flight was smooth and punctual no complaints at all despite the short duration of the flight 35 minutes refreshments were offered would consider it if needed
21607,uzbekistan airways,2,uzbekistan airways customer review,lhrtaslhr economy when checking in at lhr i was informed that the flight would be making an unscheduled stopover at paris cdg the rumour had it that it was to pick up the uzb presidents daughter all this meant the flight to tas would take 9hrs long 2 hrs longer than normal some people confirmed such unscheduled stopovers were quite commonplace i was not impressed inflight service is pretty bad so bad that when you call the stewardess they do not turn up even when they turn up they are so unhappy to be serving you so rude it is quite unbelievable i did not eat the food that was served so can not comment on that on the way back i paid the head stewardess 100 to sit in business class seats are good not flat bed but of large size
15079,nok air,6,made an error with my return,i have travelled with nok air many times and probably will in the future it is not by choice but by necessity because nok air has a monopoly on flights to phrae there are no other airlines going to phrae i dont want to be unfair with my comments but i think the reviews are valuable for people so they know what they can expect i have booked tickets for 2 people i made an error with my return day of flight so i had to change the departure date from 21st march to 20th march it was impossible to get this done on line from sydney i had to get friends in phrae to change the date at the phrae airport they couldnt change it on line either they could not get any assistance over the phone and my friends are thai they were advised to go to the airport over the phone they were told the charges to make the changes were going to cost 975 thb per person at the airport not only was the change of one day difficult but also costly nok air charges 2778 thb for this change to be effected not the 975 thb previously quoted i think this charge is extortionate it was my fault for booking the wrong date but nok air do not assist or help in any way to make the change easy it is very difficult to communicate to the staff over the phone when you finally get through to them the staff have difficulty understanding english and simply lay down their rules without any commpassion or appreciation of the difficulty they place people in i fly to thailand regularly and find the international airlines very good and the staff incredibly helpful but the internal flights particularly with nok air is not always smooth and the staff even though they are expediting their jobit is only the bare minimum with little if any charm and the endearing smile people are accustomed to seeing with the friendly thai people is mostly non existent
6214,brussels airlines,2,a disaster of a service,flew brussels airlines from brussels to stockholm worst service ever in a flight maybe with the exception of one flight with ryanair a few years ago personnel were an annoyance from the gate claiming i should checkin my luggage because id purchased some cookies at the airport duty free shops then they were late bringing us to the plane a disaster of a service never again brussels airlines i could never see value to pay more than economy now i can see no value choosing this airline unless i am forced to
2280,air mauritius,5,cabin crew was friendly,paris to mauritius the food was good chicken fish and special meals the entertainment on the plane wasnt good little screen with 18 channels and you couldnt choose a movie another issue was the leg space a problem when you are bigger than 180cms the cabin crew was friendly and can speak at least 3 languages french english and a native language when you have a question they will try to help you with a smile
16842,rossiya airlines,3,rossiya airlines customer review,ledams echecking doesnt exist so 40minute line at airport onboard almost no room between seats very claustrophobic fas are average with no charisma flights on time hot breakfast is probably the only plus of this airline
19534,syrianair,2,syrianair customer review,lhrdamascus return and and an internal flight from alp to dam the prices were good as was the outward journey food but other aspects of the service leave a lot to be desired the cabin staff on the way out smoked behind the curtain and when my husband challenged them about this they actually offered him a cigarette the flights were all on time however although immigration is tricky as noone seems to know exactly what to do if you are from abroad on the internal flight my suitcase handle was wrenched from the case didnt try and complain as it was hard enough to get into damascus airport main terminal let alone explain the suitcase had been broken staff seemed astonished that we had taken an internal flight finally there was a beetle in my salad in the in flight meal on the way home the cabin crew were very apologetic telling us as best they could in poor english that this had happened several times before we were offered extra nuts and coffee as was the man sitting next to usall in all it was an interesting experience we wanted to support syrian air but im not sure i would use them next time although i would definitely visit syria again
13270,la compagnie,7,reclining seats great service,just completed a roundtrip on la compagnie the upgraded setting is wonderful less than 80 passengers per plane reclining seats great service their schedules are a problem delayed both ways and late schedule change because they sometimes combine the flight returning from europe we missed our connecting flight but they put us up in a hotel
13734,liat,2,8hrs sitting at that airport,my first encounter with liat was january 2014 when i was about to take up residency and work in the bvi the employers asked that i purchase a oneway ticket for which they planned to reimburse but i was met with difficulty in doing so even though i provided all the necessary proof of my reason for travelling i was forced to buy a return ticket with promise that the airline would put up the balance as credit on my next flight with a year to use it however i had to pay 31 from this balance have this done i didnt travel again until a year and a half later so i lost my money my second encounter was july 2015 when i was returning from svg with my son our flight was supposed to be 315pm i never left the airport till 630pm but not before being switched to 3 different flights with 3 different sets of boarding passes no proper explanation and some how they forgot to switch our luggage it was not until i was waiting by the luggage wheel for how long until i realized i was luggageless i reported this filled the necessary paper work and they promise to contact me which they never did it was up to me to make calls all of the time to follow up on my suitcases after 3 days of hell and having to buy clothes for my son i finally received a call to say my luggage had arrived in tortola my next experience was in november 2015 when i travelled to barbados for a visa appointment with intent to return home the following day on my way back i was left at st kitts airport at 235pm to await a connecting flight i remained at that airport until 945pm with steady announcements that the flight was delayed until finally an announcement asked that the passengers return to the check in desk downstairs i was then told that my flight out would be after 6pm the next day and that transportation would take me to and from a hotel arriving at the hotel where there was no prearrangements for accommodations and had to wait hours for this to be verified thanks to liat for the 30 voucher for meal so i was scheduled to work the next afternoon shift and so had to be calling my supervisor to get a shift exchange with a coworker so i wouldnt go down as absent my next encounter was august 2015 when my son was returning home his flight was cancelled due to weather condition a fair reason next morning i show up at the airport and was told my son couldnt check in because they have to deal with the other passengers whose flights were not affected by the cancellations the day before and that my son could not get a flight out until the next 5 days this i think was ridiculous and i actually had to quarrel to get some information or i would have sat there all day without getting any in february this year i travelled to svg again on my return date i got to the airport from which i live many miles away only to be told my flight would be late and i would miss my connecting flight from barbados and that i would have to return home and travel the next day hello whats the use of providing contact info when no one bothers to use them to update you about changes my most recent encounter was last month when my 13 yr old son was returning to svg got to the airport at 1100am to check in for a 1245pm flight and spent 8hrs sitting at that airport before 1 single liat plane landed at that airport fortunately my son got home after 1am next morning without any overnights and i was grateful travelling again next 3wks better service please

8236,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,iomnclnclabz great little airline very personal service form the point of checkin to inflight service both flights only half full so made the experience very pleasant extremely efficient and takes the edge in levels of service
12787,kenya airways,4,quality of the food is poor,paid a fortune to return to kenya on short notice i have used kq many times and always flown business not used them for a few years now due to covid and using other airlines check in at heathrow and boarding the plane was a shambles stood in a business class line but no one checking in business class passengers despite being told by ground staff this was the correct lane eventually we were spotted and check became proactive after 20 minutes similar issue trying to get on the plane kq is let down by the ground handling at heathrow once on board the service is excellent with attentive staff and i like the boeing 787 quality of the beverages is good and has clearly improved the quality of the food is poor and not what would get on swiss etc in contrast on the return journey at nairobi excellent and quick check in security and lounge has improved form when used in the past food on the return leg just as bad as on the way out once again the staff were excellent and attentive and very helpful entertainment pretty poor and lacking in choice
12886,klm royal dutch airlines,6,experience with klm was good,flew kglamscph with klm 16 april 2023 on a330200 and b737 aircrafts economy lite ticket was quite cheap bought from an ota and easily handled online on klms homepage perks as flying blue gold card holder was given throughout from priority lounge selecting preferred seat etc checkin online did not work wasted time on several attempts however the checkin kgl was quick and hasslefree got option to select a better seat as the flight was full i chose an exit seat 30b which was a real winner and one of very few seats with gorgeous leg space such a seat costs 300 eur if prebooked but was offered to me during checkin free of charge likely due to my gold card this seat given to me in the last moment saved my trip as the original seating had changed the flight had become completely full and i about to be given a seat in a very crowded section near toilets access to klms 3rd party pearl lounge was granted due to my flying blue gold card the lounge is well supplied but of sparse offerings departure from kigali became 4 hours delayed however all delays were properly informed on monitors by email and by sms that caused me missing my flight in amsterdam but i did not stress just went to the klm lounge and printed out the revised bps for the last leg to cph which was scheduled ambiently enjoyed a solid nice breakfast in the impressive klm 52 lounge in nonschengen sector passport control and security check took more than an hour not acceptable the serious delay arose from a wheel puncture while the aircraft stopped over in zanzibar it was explained in detail by flight crew and from cockpit a new flight crew had just boarded in kigali they were fresh well groomed and well rested service was fine but food provided was very little though included a small hot airy pizza no alternative the wines offered were of rsa cape origin the red wine shiraz was good while the chenin blanc white wine was undrinkable they were served in well labelled minibottles which are a nice touch the cabin crew differed tremendously in attitude ranging from the typical surly patronising classic dutch crew to more modern and empathic types initially i was not recognised as status flyer but later they found out and provided me a full amenity kit and a dutch ceramic minihouse as souvenir disembarkation in schiphol was tedious by using busses from a remote stand last flight to cph was briefly on time and service onboard was fine luggage handled correctly throughout and arrived in cph timely despite having been rebooked and relabelled the experience with klm was good the serious delay from africa was well handled professional and faultless will fly again
20354,thomas cook airlines,3,plane very cramped,had booked and paid for priority boarding and extra leg rooms seats each way no priority boarding either sector told by check in on outward journey by priority desk to go to the other main queue did receive allocated seats outward but not on homeward for our 4 passengers staff at pmi seem to ignore any prebooking and allocate as they see fit no priority homeward either plane very cramped and one of us could not even get his drinks tray lowered at all as it was so cramped and he is not obese staff were helpful but a very disappointing end to a nice holiday have spoken to cooks who are arranging a refund but i really do not like this hassle over what should be a straightforward booking wont use this airline again
9399,finnair,2,will not recommend to anyone,unhelpful untrained checkin staff that does not know anything outside of the guide book we were returning to hong kong where we live and have permanent residency from paris my husband does not have a hk passport and unfortunately his hkid card was stolen together with everything in his bag 4 hours before checkin we just managed to get to the airport and file the case to the french police as my husbands passport can enter hk visafree anyway we decided not to miss the flight as we are at the checkin the checkin staff insisted on seeing either the hkid card or a visa despite the passport that my husband holds can enter hong kong visafree we explained the situation to them understanding that it might be outside of their normal procedure providing extra information and asking if theres anything we can do and all we get is a cold stare and they said but thats not our problem after very unpleasant treatments and their internal clarifications they finally let us in and when we arrived hong kong the immigration department let us in in less than 2 minutes the cabin crew are on the otherhand friendly and helpful but that was not much of a compensation for the horrible tasteless and not visually appealing food in general i have had better experience with budget airlines than finnair will not travel with them again and will not recommend to anyone
21306,ultra air,8,cheap prices comfortable seats,cheap prices comfortable seats decent legroom 30 inches on the former indigo airplane check in at bogota was done online but tourist pass for san andres and bags had to be dropped off at the check in counter which was pretty easy boarding was a breeze after take off many people switched seats since most didnt pay for an assigned one flight was 30 minutes late but otherwise good the only problem were kids running up and down the aisle like wild animals and nobody from the crew stopping them unfortunately due to colombias covid rules there was no inflight service but you are able to bring your own drinks and snacks
15125,nok air,9,best low cost i have used,bangkok to chiang mai with nok air and very impressed definitely the best low cost i have used 15kg luggage allowance boarding and departure in advance as all passengers were in brand new plane free snack onboard and free wifi i am making this review as we just started our descent
15221,norwegian,9,we are pleased with norwegian,the flight took off on schedule and landed ahead the cabin is clean delicate and seats are pretty good for a budget airline it is really much better than competitors we have tried service is acceptable but not brilliant crew is smiling and efficient i like the pricing model norwegian uses you by the basic fare and add optionals as required much like buying a car we are pleased with norwegian and will continue using their services the only reason i dont give full score is the somewhat chaotic check in but i suspect that is an airport issue beyond the control of norwegian
5265,bahamasair,9,bahamasair customer review,fllnasfll and i found no problem with them aside from their ageing fleet of b737200s the flight attendants were very nice return flight was bumpy but decent
20514,tianjin airlines,8,good amount seat recline,xian to london on 10th feb 2020 aircraft only 35 years old good amount seat recline with charger available however the entertainment system need an upgrade it is the coronavirus outbreak at moment the crew did an excellent job measuring temperature and disinfected the aircraft excellent cabin service i went back to spoke with cabin crew they are willing to share their stories and experiences the lack of entertainment system is covered by the excellent crew service

3606,airbaltic,4,cabin service extremely poor,gatwick to riga comfortable plane and excellent take off and landing but cabin service was extremely poor attendants simply failed to offer any food or beverage could not understand announcements in english and airbaltic is the first airline ive ever known not to offer free water to customers absolutely shocking

15168,norse atlantic airways,1,worst airline incompetent missing baggage,worst airline incompetent missing baggage do not use this company you think cheaper tickets but when you add it all up you pay more than you pay a reputable airline company had to pay for ticket and checked in luggage giving only 15 kg option for checked in luggage initially you have to go along with it you have to pay 30 for a single meal on flight then when your ticket is confirmed you find there are other baggage choices available but no way of changing your option you have no choice but to pay extra for choosing any other option when you are checking in the staff weighs and checks the size of each n every bag you are carrying no flexibility even if you are 100 gms over the weight limit my daughter flew to florida with them this is her first trip to america on her own her checked in baggage went missing she was so distressed at the airport no norse staff was available at the baggage claim area the security guard had to help her poor girl was tearful stressed and anxious and completely besides herself she was looking forward to going on a youth bus tour norse promised to look into it but it had been 5 days and still no news my daughter had essential items clothes toiletries medication contact lenses etc in her checked in baggage there is no phone number for customer service email responses are rubbish my poor girl is so stressed without her bag and her trip has started with such a bad experience thanks to norse the company is totally incompetent and very unhelpful

6991,china eastern airlines,6,an enjoyable experience,melbourne to london via shanghai customer service both customer service office in melbourne and sydney office were very helpful please note that the melbourne office is only contactable by email never answers the phone if you want to speak to someone call the sydney office crew very professional in all flights thank you to them for making our flight an enjoyable experience time keeping all four were flights arrived on time very unusual in my experience pvg terminal 1 departurestransit depending on your ticket class the airline offers a dining voucher selected places when having a long stop over in pvg 80rmbpp this is enough to get you a decent bowl of noodles each at hope star coffee cafe the info is on their website but difficult to find see below for more transiting info check in pvg many checkin desks open very quick and painless cons food poor even coming out of shanghai turbulence at the first sign of turbulence the seat belt sign lights up and then stays on for the entire flight this happened on all four flights everyone ends up ignoring it as a result website hard to navigate and makes many errors online check in pointless both in london and shanghai no bag drop for online check in only mel check in lhr very few check in desks open 1 hour to checkin boarding passes when checking in online it asks you to print your boarding passes no point as they print it for you at the airport our computer could not find the font to print the boarding passes another occasion the website did not recognise our checkin pvg terminal 1 arrivals cash machine did not work on our arrival if this is the case you need to walk to terminal 2 to withdraw cash pvg terminal 1 departurestransit shops are generally quite poor and expensive and so to are the nearly all the restaurants one cafe that stands out is hope star coffee cafe serves decent food nicely presented by far the best place to eat in terminal 1 there is also two starbucks one at each end of the terminal one has seats inside the other just takeaway depending on your ticket class or your time of stopover you could instead choose a maglev pass or a hotel room for a number of hours over the dining voucher but the airline said we could not leave the airport with a 7hr stopover when waiting to go through immigration and number of people we told they could not enter on their transit and we directed through to the transit area if youre looking to stopover for a couple of days you can get a 144hr visa on arrival at no charge this also allows you to visit selected provinces the bullet train makes it possible to do this we visited friends in nanjing on our return leg to shanghai the train took 1hr 11mins to travel 290km costing around 35aud one way
20014,thai airways,9,meals were absolutely exquisite,tokyohaneda to bangkok then to jakarta onboard their airbus a330 and boeing 777 right on the 63rd anniversary of this airline the tokyobangkok leg was sublime the crews in thai traditional uniforms treated us like they were happy to have all passengers onboard this very special occasion they were friendly professional and always present throughout the flight the seat was comfortable but they could have added some extra legroom since my leg touched the seat in front of me when sleeping in a relaxedreclined position and for the record i am only 5 ft 6 ground staff at haneda were friendly and professional as well the positive trend was continued by the ife system and the food i received on the flight not only did i receive two meals but they were absolutely exquisite although their rice could use a tad more seasoning to make it perfect the ife system on the a330 contained more selections than their 777s with the same good level of responsiveness and excellent layout it was the bangkokjakarta leg that brought the scores down a little bit the ground staff at bangkok as usual were not up to the land of smiles name the crews seemed to lack friendliness although they remained professional and efficient the seats were a tad too hard although had better legroom and the inflight entertainment was an old model that lacked responsiveness and often hung and crashed although it had good selections and layout the meal served on this flight however were just as delicious as my previous 3 thai flights overall in these two anniversaryedition flights there were some downsides that need improvement especially on the bangkokjakarta leg but the thai touch has not completely vanished i can see that theyre slowly but surely going back to its former glory
3036,air transat,1,i am considered fully vaccinated,i booked an emergency flight to amsterdam but i got rejected while checking in because i dont have three doses of the covidvaccine even though your own website and amsterdams government website states that you only need two to travel from toronto to amsterdam i am considered fully vaccinated you cost me not only missing the funeral but my time gas tears and money
10476,go first,2,last airline one should opt for,flight was 4 hours late started at midnight staff very curt and unfriendly towards irate passengers due to the delay go first is the last airline one should opt for across all sectors they keep rescheduling the flight
11954,jeju air,6,the plane was very dirty,seoul incheon to tokyo narita cheap ticket and wasnt expecting much but the plane was very dirty and tired looking my seat back tray had clearly been used as a kids colouring book at some point on a previous flight and was covered in long stripes of multi colored crayon i didnt purchase any food on the flight so i didnt need to make use of the tray so not a big deal though the seat pocket and the sides of my seat were utterly gross caked deep with crumbs food fragments and assorted gunge that was all a bit nasty no entertainment screens but there were in flight radio channels available which i didnt use as i had my ipod to listen to as usual the seats were a bit cramped with my knees touching the back of the seat in front im 6ft tall so nothing particularly new on an lcc flight when i put my bottle of water in the seat pocket i had to sit at an angle so i could fit in the space as well the flight itself was smooth enough the cabin attendants were polite and friendly and we got to our destination without any delays of troubles not the cleanest plane ive ever been on but we got from a to b cheaply
19134,sriwijaya air,2,no customer support,we have taken two legged flight with this airline and first one departed with 1h delay and second leg is first postponed by one hour and then by two hour delay second leg was delayed by 3h in total so we missed the connection boat no customer support no explanation
15945,philippine airlines,5,in flight staff really try their best,considering it is a supposed to be a national full service airline it really feels behind several times during our vacation they would have delays or misrepresent them by having technical landings only informing us days before our flight with no service or compensation of course cabins themselves are quite cold and uncomfortable again not usually an issue for budget carriers but this is supposed to be a national airline two bright spots would be that the in flight staff really try their best and the routes from mnl to the united states are by far the cheapest available
6163,brussels airlines,4,food served was rather minimalist,boarding at frankfurt was on time but without priority boarding for business class passengers food served was rather minimalist but tasted well far better than the foodmaker salads they used to serve unfortunately the cutlery on brussels airlines flights is nowadays bamboo cutlery which doesnt give a pleasant feeling when eating why cant they serve meals with metal cutlery in business class as other airlines do they serve champagne in business class a cheap one duval leroy but luckily one that tastes quite well i was offered several refills by the sn crew which on this flight was surprisingly friendly where often sn crews can be really grumpy
14390,mahan air,6,mahan air customer review,birmingham bangkok via stopover in tehran fairly basic service but courteous and attentive staff checkin good both ways no ptv entertainment in economy just one large screen showing various poor quality iranian films and documentaries food questionable quality but plenty of nonalcoholic drinks most passengers appeared to be travelling either to iran or onwards to india and similar think we were the only europeans going to bangkok stopover in tehran was fine staff helpful business lounge not bad at all women must wear headscarves though and cover bare armsshoulders mahan provided garments gratis for this purpose
15027,niki,9,niki customer review,nice to vienna return flight cost less than 100 euros including luggage was expecting budget airline but pleasantly surprised when drinks and newspapers were offered free of charge was even more surprised when a snack was included service was courteous and efficient embraer e175 was new and airy compared to similar aircraft regular updates from the cockpit all in all a class act and not sure how they make any profit
10307,georgian airways,6,cheap lowcost airline,pros direct flight from barcelona to tbilisi competitive prices aircraft is comfortable cons cant choose your meal no inflight entertainment aircraft is rather small embraer 190 yet comfortable cant beat direct flights and good prices other than that it just feels like a cheap lowcost airline but still my preferred option for my location
19384,sunwing airlines,4,worst flight i have ever taken,flying back from miami to toronto boarding time was 1120 waiting and nothing was told to us boarded at 1220 apparently there was a snow storm in toronto and a 3hr flight turned into a 6hr flight going to hamiliton and sitting on the plane for over 2hrs mind you our flight was to land at 3pm no food was offered to us only one small cookie and water hungry and frustrated for hours sitting on the plane stating it was gonna leave to toronto every 15 minutes and never did once landed in toronto around 9pm had to take a shuttle to customs and baggage claim once customs was done getting our baggage was a hassle 3 times they told us different areas to pick up luggage waiting and waiting my luggage was no where to be seen finding my luggage in a totally different area then told worst flight i have ever taken and worst experience getting my luggage
16505,qantaslink,8,qantaslink customer review,flew the dash 8 400 service from melbourne to adelaide over the weekend i really like the dash 8 aircraft and enjoy qantaslinks service the aircraft was approximately 30 full on todays flight the cabin manager was very engaging and always smiling whilst her offsider had that bad qf attitude that their famous for we were served a small refreshment which came in a small box consisting of feta cheese crackers some chocolate and mints and a beer the journey over to adelaide was generally a good one and will continue to use qf for this dash 8 service
16271,porter airlines,1,first flight was cancelled,ottawa to toronto my first flight was cancelled the airline said that it was plane trouble i was bumped to a later flight and we landed 20 minutes ago we are still sitting on the tarmac not moving waiting for a gate to pull in this is terrible service we have landed more than 20 mins ago and no one will tell us anything or get us off this flight
4608,asiana airlines,3,seat was smaller than i expected,the asiana business class seat was smaller than i expected and service was worse than i expected my food was not delicious with a limit choice of meals i was bored by the entertainment blanket a pillow and slippers provided pyjamas and mattress were not provided for sleeping time and i need to make bed myself i could not sleep well due to uncomfortable bed the staff at sydney check in did not add my mileage points to my asiana club member when i requested i need to claim my missing mileages when i got home this is my first time i did not enjoy a business class flight
15824,pegasus airlines,1,very bad service on board,very bad service on board you feel you are in market not a flight all during the flight selling product just to test them i asked for a tap glass of water they refuse that and ask me to pay 2 for small bottle
4654,asiana airlines,5,i wont bother again,flew sydney to london via seoul and return in economy after reading many reviews about asiana i thought id fly with them this time back to the uk but after this time i wont bother again its not that theyre bad but sia and cathay pacific are so much better the food was nothing special and rather odd in texture the entertainment system was old with poor response from the touch screen and very limited choice of movies i dont sleep well on flights so usually spend a lot of time watching movies i didnt finish one baggage allowance was a measly 20kg not that i expect to travel with all my household furnishings but id like to travel and not worry im going to go over my weight allowance on the outbound flight from sydney my wife was asleep so i ate her snack my bad after she woke up i went to see if i could get her another one that was a no as she already had her allocated snack with cathay just in the crew area they have bowls of fruit and other snacks that you can help yourself to want something hot no bother with cx have some noodles an annoying thing when youre trying to sleep is that whenever we hit turbulence the screen would light up i dont understand korean and maybe its something to do with the korean language but youd get these long announcements but in english it ends up garbled and very brief does korean use more to say less im asian myself and can understand that many asians have trouble with the english language but considering english is the language all airlines are supposed to use the standard was poor and i missed more than i actually caught i suppose you get what you pay for and they where at the cheaper end of the price scale but still its the little things that add up to make it a less than an experience id want to repeat
18804,southwest airlines,2,advise you to find another airline,i entered premium economy as i paid the fee to upgrade my boarding status so i could get a seat in the front of the plane on a preferred aisle seat this was fine in cancun but when i was to board in houston passengers who were taken off the plane were allowed to board prior to those of us who had paid for the priority boardingseats and occupied the forward seats despite most not having paid for the seats this also occurred when departing nashville the only difference being the passengers continuing on who came in on the flight were allowed to remain on the plane and improve their seats prior to our boarding i was forced to more than halfway back in the plane if these people are continuing on they should board in the respective class with those boarding at the gate southwest is basically stealing the upgrade fee as their terrible policy of disregarding those have paid for early boarding despite those who improve their seats without paying for the privilege in flight wifientertainment was not working and there are no charging ports or receptacles to charge devices this was my first experience with the airline and i plan on it being the last at least if i pay for premium economy or business class i am able to receive my monies worth the seats were very uncomfortable that is enough i think you get the point i definitely advise you to find another airline
18735,southwest airlines,3,now youre a legacy carrier,i ordered two coffees with three sugars each repeated three times im first row window seat on left behind door the cabin steward hands me two coffees with three creamers each no lids and no tables to set them on why couldnt lids be provided it took three hours to get my first beverage im up at 5 to make 630 flight and coffee providers are closed thanks for really screwing up a mornings start i also appreciate that southwest wants my feedback click on the feedback tab to ask what did you use app for id honestly like to know why i did too feedback is static please make no comments submit you used to be low cost now youre a legacy carrier and as soon as ive exhausted my points using my companion fare your credit card goes in the back of dresser so spent on the lesser quality of flying southwest now used to be fun exuberant staff but now they treat you like a mcdonalds employee would treat you all the draws that made me loyal are falling to the wayside you can tell the employees look at this like a job instead of a career
9859,flynas,8,had no issues on board,lahore to riyadh flight was ontime and had no issues on board flight map was bit slow but the inflight entertainment was wonderful and there was variety was movies games and inflight magazines to read aircraft was also new and staff were generous i would recommend this airline for tourist coming and going tofrom saudi arabia
8099,dragonair,2,dragonair customer review,this flight was one of the worst flights i have been on an hour and 50 min flight was already really unbearable for me economy on this plane has absolutely no legroom im 59 and seats were terribly designed the cabin crew were rude and were not friendly the food was as usual for cathay pacific and dragonair flights had tiny portions and were awful in fact this time it was even cold and soggy i was on a school trip so i had no choice for an airline however we did get our own check in counter which was good nevertheless the avod ife system was really good and there were a wide range of movies and tv series to choose from
2058,air koryo,6,air koryo customer review,beijing to sunan international an experience to fly their il62 it was back in time food was good and service efficient as north koreans travel with lots and lots of baggage it was placed all over the plane plane on time in sunan but waited more than 1 hour for our baggage
17878,shanghai airlines,9,shanghai airlines customer review,i was just in the booking process for a shanghaixian flight in discounted first class when they interrupted my input and changed the fares instead of a surcharge of 20 above the eco fare they lowered the economy fares substantially and came to a ratio of 13 i immediately switched to the new discounted eco fare landed at less than 40 of the original budget and felt quite comfortable the flight from hongqiao apt to xian takes a little more than two hours one can really accept all the environment and service features they offer clean 737800 with better seat pitch than most european airlines they offer a hot snack enroute two choices a limited beverage selection no alcoholic beverages do not expect a sophisticated ife just those small screens above your head for every second row the flight was fully booked absolutely on time and a real bargain what more can you expect my marks are once again quite high for this china eastern affiliate
15918,peruvian airlines,7,aircraft was basic but clean,despite the numerous negative reviews we were happy with our return flights on peruvian from lima to iquitos the first flight was on time and the return was delayed by around 1 hour due to late incoming aircraft but the lan flight departing iquitos at the same time also had a short delay perhaps the delays experienced by others were specific to the cusco route aircraft was basic but clean with no inflight entertainment to be expected on short routes peruvian does not have the newest airplanes but the interior did not feel particularly dated service was fine we were pleasantly surprised to be served food and drink on such a short flight baggage arrived on time tickets were somewhat cheaper than lan or avianca because peruvian like star peru does not impose a surcharge on foreign passengers
5115,azerbaijan airlines,8,azerbaijan airlines customer review,both flights pekgyd and gydlhr were on new boeing 787 with 333 seating beijingbaku flight was full and i was randomly allocated seat 21c on the front row of the rear section so i had no trouble at all with legroom bakulondon flight was about threequarters empty so i had plenty of space to lie across the row of three seats 23a the seats themselves are fairly comfortable for economy class the attendants on the first flight were particularly friendly and attentive although i have no particular complaints about those on the second leg the meals were very good on both flights although i had requested a vegetarian meal out of slight preference rather than insistence which was not available while this was not a huge disadvantage for me personally it will have been a problem for more resolute vegetarians my main criticism is the lack of content on the entertainment system the interface works very well but there was no interesting material to watchlisten to i had a long layover in baku but the airport itself is outstanding nice modern design clean efficient sofas to sleep and chargers i did not buy anything at the airport since i heard it would be overpriced and i do not know if this is true or not
20255,thai smile airways,1,excellent full service,excellent full service including light meals on board comfortable seat nice and friendly staff with enthusiasm appropriate time schedule and destination

16740,regional express,5,regional express customer review,sydneynarranderasydney return 27 august29 august on regional express airlines also known as rex great flights with good clean quiet cabin no loud overhead pop music thank heavens good service with coffee and snacks and very pleasant smiling attractive fas i like the saab 340 and also now generally prefer rex to qantaslink partly because of the use of pop music over the pa system on qantaslink these days remarkably quick baggage collection at rex in terminal 2 at sydney airport partly because i suppose one has to travel by tarmac bus from the aircraft parked at very remote stands from this terminal and that takes some time however it is an interesting journey a nice professional airline and look forward to flying with rex again

9435,finnair,5,feels a lot like low cost,from paris to helsinki no food at all feels like low cost from helsinki to bangkok and then singapore to helsinki flights very long 13 hours because we cannot fly over russia no pre snack on the main meal no choice and no dessert only a small omelette left hungry ifeavod limited very distant flight attendants on 3 out of my 4 flights chose them because of the price indeed its cheaper but feels a lot like low cost
10258,garuda indonesia,9,very pleasant flight,amsterdam to denpasar via medan on a 7yearold airbus a330200 with a 2x4x2 seat configuration although the plane was relatively old it didnt seem that way except for the quite small 9 screens and the outdated ife garuda should really update this as the on demand choice is small and the software kind of slow excellent check in service very charming polite and courteous crew i just cant find any mistake in their passenger handling legroom was good plane was only half full the cabin service including drinks was fine as they kept coming and offered new drinks food was average in my opinion snack choice available but limited previously you had to change planes in jakarta to fly to bali now they offer a connection via medan in medan the plane got refueled cleaned a bit and half of the passengers left here while passengers to denpasar had to stay on the plane they promise a 30mins layover but ours was more like 90 mins which wasnt really a problem as it makes the whole flight still shorter than via jakarta before a very pleasant flight will definitely fly garuda again

23039,xl airways france,2,very small and hard seats,on an economy flight you should not expect to much but you should expect something it starts with not being able to check in and print boarding passes on line next if your not aware please note that luggage weight limit is 44 lbs not the standard 50 very little assistance for the disabled they offer everything you may need at a price pillows blankets drinks water free meal all at substantial cost worst though are the very small and hard seats most uncomfortable flight in my life attendents slow to respond to any request unless your buying something on the positive flight was on time never fly again with xl

428,aerolineas argentinas,4,asked to move to emergency row,buenos aires to rio de janeiro bad service asked to move to emergency row because the regular row is too tight for my size 193cm and cause hurt to my legs the answer was no because i have problems with my legs ridiculous i frequently travel in the emergency row and i am fully capable that discussion would not exist if they have normal space for legs

6961,china eastern airlines,7,recommend it for the price,toronto to cebu via shanghai i stayed up the night before my flight petrified of of the terrible reviews i was reading it wasnt a bad experience well worth the price of my roundtrip from canada to the philippines with a quick stopover in shanghai you cant expect premium service for bargain prices but id say nothing was bad about this airline just average quality minus the wifi which was nonexistent i found the food perfectly fine no vegetarian options but it was served hot and was serviceable though definitely nothing to write home about the staff were pleasant enough and had decent english the inflight entertainment had an average selection of movies with chinese subs and the plane itself was very clean and comfortable enough if a bit cramped what matters was every flight left on time and got me to my destination in one piece overall id recommend it for the price
8499,egyptair,4,have not received my luggage,im so disappointed from your service i had flight from cairo to benghazi through your company last wednesday and i have not received my luggage until this moment this happens to many passengers and as i came to know this happens frequently very bad service
10360,germanwings,7,good flight and friendly staff,amsterdam to stuttgart good flight and a friendly staff airplane departed and arrived on time i booked a smart ticket i was able to select a seat without additional charge and they offered a snack and drink on board the only negative part of the flight was the snack it contains a very small sandwich a small bottle of water and something sweet the taste of the snack was bad even for airplane food
21982,vistara,2,experience was extremely disappointing,the worst airline i have ever flown with i booked and paid a premium for seating in row seven online check in allocated the three of us row 25 i emailed vistara three days prior to our departure explaining that when checking in online we had been allocated the incorrect seats no response was received airport check in staff either couldnt or wouldnt correct the obvious error and didnt seem care even though one person in our group had mobility issues there response was that they were only responsible for checking in and it wasnt their problem so now i have to fill out paperwork to claim a refund for the seating i booked and paid for which was allocated to someone else also the people in row 24 were totally ignorant of normal polite inflight protocol and reclined their seats which affected the person in our group with the mobility issue we asked them to be not recline their seats but all to no avail eventually after a vocal exchange with these people a flight attendant moved them to different seats the whole experience was extremely disappointing and very unprofessional
12940,klm royal dutch airlines,9,an excellent trip,an excellent trip on time departure from lhr then 3 hours in the lounge at schiphol we boarded on time but took off 90 minutes late due to delays loading the aircraft onboard the seats are great roomy and comfy the ife has more than enough choices for a 12 hour flight and even a free wifi connection for a limited time the food was very tasty some of the best ive had in the air finally the crew were excellent efficient while still being amicable and chatty after taking off 90 minutes late we were only about 20 minutes late arriving in lima
496,aerolineas argentinas,8,aerolineas argentinas customer review,i took 3 domestic flights aeroparquesalta menodzabariloche in y and barilocheaeroparque in cclass with aerolineas argentinas in the last 3 weeks each flight was leaving and arriving on time the crew were nice though not all of the crew members spoke english the snacks as well as the drinks offered were rather boring but free of charge the planes were comfortable enough for the short flights especially the brand new embraer of air austral with ife in each seat were great
2802,air serbia,9,it was a nice flight,checkin for the flight went fine and gate 21 at t4 at heathrow used for air serbia flights is very spacious and nice for aircraft spotting flight from belgrade arrived on time but boarding started some 15 minutes prior scheduled departure so we were slightly delayed and arrival in belgrade was 5 minutes late after scheduled arrival the cabin was full in economy and only one passenger in business there were 9 businesses seats available for this flight business class is now changed earlier it used to have different leather seats in configuration 22 and now it is flexible the seats are the same as in economy 33 with guaranteed empty middle seat soon after departure crew gave us free snacks and a glass of water later on they started serving sandwiches drinks and snacks from their deli menu paid menu unfortunately no hot food available on this 25 hour flight was available prices of deli menu were fair and the quality of food was good much better than they served them for free in the past my opinion is that its better to get tasty sandwich for money now than two pieces of bread with butter inside for free airline crew did their job professionally and their appearance was nice captain made few announcements during the flight about our route and weather conditions at the destination airport so that was fine too there was no flight entertainment available but i had option to buy wifi internet access landing went fine overall it was a nice flight
18634,south african airways,1,on board service was good,following the demise of ba comair we were booked onto saa for the final leg of a return from the uk on ba what a pleasure to find a proper business class seat with good legroom compared with the european standard economy class seat with the middle seat blocked check in and boarding were efficient and on board service was good there were no hassles with the transfer at ort and the a320 on the second leg had the best regional business cabin i have experienced very spacious 2x2 configuration again service was good and our overall impression was the the staff were very pleased to be back and keen to provide top service
15974,philippine airlines,6,cabin crew was professional,flight was delayed approximately 35hrs taking off honolulu at 3pm instead of 1135am the ground staff at pal provided free refreshments a nice touch once airborne the flight was very smooth as far as inflight service i couldnt ask for better airline service the cabin crew was professional courteous and attentive even passing out menus in economy which i havent seen in years hot towels were passed out before landing again a nice touch after a smooth and wonderful flight what spoiled everything was that not all of our luggage was delivered the baggage personnel stated that my sons baggage 2 pieces and my wifes baggage 1 piece was pulled and not loaded on our aircraft due to possible weight issues which i dont believe as none of this was ever brought to my attention when we checked in our luggage my wife and son completed the paperwork for the missing luggage and for compensation the baggage personnel stated they would load the baggage on the next days pr 101 and deliver to our hotel the flight is delayed even more not landing in manila until approximately 9pm tonight i hope our missing luggage will be delivered my son had to buy clothes since none of his luggage was delivered as much as i would like to give pal a 5star rating because of the wonderful inflight service this luggage issue prevents me from doing this the delay i can tolerate but the luggage issue is inexcusable how pal handles this luggage issue will determine if i fly them again i will be extremely furious if this issue is not resolved
7937,cubana airlines,4,cubana airlines customer review,gatwick to havana via holquin airport in may we found cabin crew friendly and entertainment consisted of 2 quite recent good films we travelled with our 2 children and they were always catered for first which means a lot very comfortable flight with adequate leg room much better than some airlines we have flown with we would fly with cubana again
20990,tui airways,4,dissatisfaction with this airline,gatwick to guanacaste a middling to poor experience for us which we shall not repeat the boeing 787 is a nice aircraft large windows the famed pressurisation ensuring a higher level of comfort however the seats were showing signs of age and generally the plane was dirty especially the toilets seating is also cramped in 333 layout what is worse is the truly dreadful food in way too small quantities as well as the quite mediocre service with some truly surly staff members though not all they also seat you apart randomly if you do not pay extra for the price i found the experience to be subpar and i had a general feeling of dissatisfaction with this airline
21549,uzbekistan airways,6,a wonderful journey,i experienced a wonderful journey with uzbekistan airways my flight is from kuala lumpur to istanbul and we transit at tashkent airport for 9 hours we can only be able to enter a business lounge 3 hours before our flight so we just sat around the airport performed our prayers as a muslim and they have comfortable praying areas at the airport the business lounge check in was fast and excellent
17572,sata air azores,5,fly again if the cheapest option,i have mixed reviews the check in process in boston was extremely smooth and my flight was right on time my first leg from boston to ponta delgada was on an old plane with very small seats and tiny overhead bins i have never been on a plane with smaller seats i am 5ft 2in and when the tray for the meal came down i couldnt move my legs one bit we landed in the azores on time and instead of going through the transit line like the people going to lisbon the connecting flight to porto had to go through immigration and customs even though i had a boarding pass for my next flight and the flight was made all on one booking out to the check in area and back through security only to walk directly back past the transit door on the way to my gate my next flight to porto was delayed two hours because the plane was late coming in from toronto but delays are expected so that didnt really bother me my plane going to porto was a newer plane with large leather seats and lots of space in the overhead bins if only that was my plane from boston i might have gotten some sleep the flight was smooth and the flight attendants on both flights were nice and helpful the food was fine nothing special but not bad overall it wasnt the worst travel experience but not the best i would fly them again if it was the cheapest option by a significant amount but would probably pay a little extra for a nicer airline
13105,kulula,5,kulula customer review,booked on a flight from cpt to jnb at check in i was told my flight had been delayed by 2 hours without asking they changed me to a british airways flight at no extra cost even though i did not get to fly with them im more than happy to book with them in the future given their excellent customer service
6907,china airlines,6,food and service average,christchurch to auckland have previously flown with this airline in business class and could not fault it we flew premium economy this time and were very disappointed the seats are very comfortable and lots of movies to choose from but the food and service were average we had flown from brisbane to auckland three days earlier and were fed fried rice no other choices that was it coming back it was chicken with mushrooms rice and vegetables it was ok but under seasoned and very bland my husband cannot eat mushrooms and he eats hardly any vegetables when he advised the hostess of this she came back with a serve of garlic bread from business class that was his meal he has a healthy appetite and was not impressed i would point out that the same meals were being service to economy class so not effort made to provide something a little bit better in premium economy drinks service limited one with your meal and another one just after that was it i do not think they were ever offering spirits they also did not come round offering water on a regular basis as most airlines will definitely go business class next time i do recommend that
17913,shanghai airlines,9,shanghai airlines customer review,shanghai to hanoi on a new and clean 737800 once in the air the flight was one of the best experiences i have had on an chinese airline only hainan airlines is comparable these 2 are streaks ahead of the rest fas friendly helpful and looked genuinely happy i had a random window seat in economy yet i had the most leg room i have had on any internal flight on a narrow body aircraft the food was very good if i needed to be somewhere on time for a certain connecting flight i might choose an airline that has a better ontime record but if time is not so much a factor the pros traveling with shanghai outweigh the cons

4021,allegiant air,4,my last time flying with allegiant air,we were supposed to board 51223 at 115 pm and then they gave us an announcement that our flight got delayed and they didnt know for how long the fda delayed the flight due to high traffic so youre telling me every time there is a holiday you are going to delay cancel a flight because of high traffic ridiculous not to mention last time i flew with them i was stranded at the airport for 4 hours because they were fixing the brakes of the airplane and i didnt get to my destination till 1 am this will be my last time flying with allegiant air

22278,vlm airlines,3,vlm airlines customer review,lcyantwerp disappointing experience long queue at baggage drop due to only one attendant being present a second eventually appeared but was inadequately prepared did not have the key to work the baggage belt stood there for 5 mins totally ignored whilst the attendant made a barrage of calls to remedy the situation without even a sorry to keep you waiting flight ok but i find the fokker 50s poor and noisy in comparison to the 146s overall the same level of mediocrity and couldnt give a stuff attitude that affects so many airlines these days i would suggest some of their staff need to be sent for retraining

20051,thai airways,6,unpleasant transfer in bangkok,first leg on an old boeing 777 with ok seat pitch food out of frankfurt very bad seems to be a problem in eco with many asian airlines flying out of there the flight attendant in my sector wasnt very responsive at the beginning of the flight it took 30 mins to get a drink after food was handed out but eventually we warmed up and finally got all i could ask for after the usual unpleasant transfer in bangkok their security check is simply a pain onward flight to jakarta was far better than the first part of the journey wonderful plane new airbus 350 clean and very attentive crew catering much better
4791,austrian airlines,3,one of the worst airlines,one of the worst airlines i have fly with for direct fly from new york to vienna the width of seats been 39cm this kind of aircraft could be used for short flights but not for 89 hours direct flights another think is if you are seated in the last rows of aircraft you will have to eat only what remains crew will just told you that there is only last option even the other passengers have more options from my point of view this is very unprofessional if you pay same cost as another passengers and you are just unlucky where youve been seated if you have a chance look for another flight and not use austrian

12181,jetairfly,2,jetairfly customer review,we recently traveled on from mexico to brussels and return the reservation was made over 9 month ago a month prior to departure the airline changed many things departure and arrival times class of service booked and even the type of plane used however when we finally started our journey the plane was delayed 35 hours the comfort class booked did not have all the service elements described or offered from no blankets to many other things because the delay connections in brussels were missed the airline offered zero help on the return flight we booked a class of service which jetairfly claimed is no longer available and therefore had to downgrade our booking at the airport and in the plane there personal did not know the situation and confirmed that this is comfort class if you have a choice of flying another carrier please do
16945,royal air maroc,8,very happy with my trips,dakar to casablanca i am very happy with my trips with royal air maroc it is the company with which i travel for more than 10 years i never had a problem with checkin or luggage all my trips were fantastic at the boarding the staff was very hospitable with the passengers on board the crew was welcoming the flight was very pleasant
17696,scoot,1,extremely slow counter service,extremely slow counter service flight was supposed to take off at 2pm but people still stuck at the checkin counter for some reason people could bring in multiple carryon luggages and were allowed to use other seats overhead compartments causing massive delays as flight crew had to restow luggage into cargo for other passengers who rightfully had the compartments for their own use did the counter crew not check boarding passengers and allowed one person to bring in not only 2 suitcases but also multiple bags we had a karen who not only used one full compartment for her 4 bags of souvenirs but still had the gall to demand crew to leave her suitcases with her when they were trying to stow them into cargo cabin crew is trying their best but people are extremely inconsiderate so maybe have more stringent checks it has been almost 25 minutes delay now due to counter checking incompetence and flight has still not hit the runway do not recommend
19934,thai airasia,1,refused to waive rescheduling fees,phitsanulok to bangkok booked for april 2020 unsympathetic airline which refused to waive rescheduling fees during this difficult period when there are so many travel restrictions to control the covid19 virus it is not possible to get through their hotline even waiting for the online customer service officer took me 2 days for a 3000 baht ticket they charged me 1700 baht for rescheduling incredulous we are discouraged from traveling for leisure during this period of lockdown
8873,ethiopian airlines,4,unable to say where the bags are,had a very good flight to bangkok and back with friendly hostesses and adequate food when we landed in cape town from bangkok non of our luggage arrived with us with no one able to say where it is or when it would arrive 2530 passengers had the same problem on this flight had to spend lots of money on locksmiths and toiletries as all ours were in our travel luggage ethiopian airways contact center is very difficult to reach they keep you on hold for almost an hour then it just hangs up after eventually making contact with the call center a day later they are unable to say where the bags are or if they even have the bags and that they will only offer compensation if they havent been able to locate the bags after 25 days this means we have to buy new clothes and shoes as most of ours were in our luggage with absolutely no assurance or compensation from the airline it seems like lost luggage is a regular problem on the airline with very poor communication or restorative measures i wouldnt recommend using the airline
2464,air namibia,7,air namibia customer review,jnbwindhoek although plane not full it did seem cramped short flight but the crew worked to get round to everyone some of the crew friendly others less so main concern was on taking off several items within the cabin fell off cover for an emergency exit 2 overhead storage cabins opened and the crew seemed to think this was normal and just refixed the items and carried on food was good though and seemed very cheap compared to saa
278,aer lingus,1,it was a nightmare,san francisco to paris via dublin do not use this airline it was our first time using them and it will definitely be our last both flights to our destination were late putting us behind by about 2 hours on our arrival to paris a little annoying but fine however the trip home was absolutely wretched lol and i cannot emphasize this enough to start when we arrived to check in 2 hours before boarding there was already an announcement stating the flight was delayed by 1 hr once boarded we sat for an additional hour on the tarmac causing us to miss our connecting flight home amazingly the only flight of theirs that left only 15 minutes late they rerouted us to seattle which meant an addition 25 hour layover before boarding the connecting flight there was no offer of food or beverages even though we were missing our inflight meal service once we boarded the connecting flight we again sat for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the tarmac no offer of snacks or food mind you we are about 4 hours past when we should of had out meal service so we were starving thank god our last flight from seattle to san fran was with alaska airlines as they were great so to sum things up we were originally to be home at 330 pm on 92 but we didnt arrive until 93 at 12 am and of course our baggage was still in dublin adding an additional 30 minutes in the airport to submit a claim for the lost bags it was a nightmare and i will never ever use them again

10834,hainan airlines,9,really friendly and welcoming,flying with hainan airlines is a great experience return ticket from auckland to beijing cost only 800 usd ground service is excellent due to the short transit time in shenzhen the ground staff met me at the boarding gate and guided me to checkin to avoid missing my flight i like flying with boeing 787 as the seats are spacious and comfortable the inflight entertainment is awesome with plenty of programmes the cabin crew are really friendly and welcoming i highly recommend to fly with hainan airlines

18074,silkair,9,a worthy and solid performer,singapore to luang prabang return in april with a stopover in vientiane on the outgoing leg to laos second time on silkair this year and i was very pleased with the service to luang prabang checkin went without a hitch and boarding for the flight was quick as it was a low load on the singapore to vientiene sector i was served a total of six times on my flight to luang prabang by a very cheerful bunch of cabin attendants snacks drinks wine meals desserts etc the main meal of chicken pasta was alright but i wish they didnt skimp on the salad flight wasnt full so i had lots of room to stretch arrival in luang prabang was on time even with the slight delay in vientiane on the return flight it was a direct trip to singapore without a stopover this time round i think they were running short of wine as they only served this in a cup and didnt give out bottles the main meal was seafood pasta which was way better than the lunch i got once again they skimped on the salad inflight entertainment was quirky and the app crashed a lot good thing that i got newspapers on both legs of the journey all in all the cabin crew service was top notch and i really felt that they provided a great service this airline does have room for improvement but i can say that silkair is still quite a worthy and solid performer
21529,us airways,2,us airways customer review,we recently travelled via us airways to st lucia virgin islands our return flight home was routed through charlotte nc here we were scheduled for a 3 hour layover plenty of time to get through customs and immigration and recheck our baggage for our final destination however the plane was one hour late in boarding in st lucia upon our arrival in charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our deplaning once at the gate we were told that customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane at this point we had 1 hour left to get through customs and immigration recheck our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take off my husband had tsa precheck on his ticket however i did not i had to go through a very long security line my husband went to the gate to notify our plane that i was on my way hurrying just as i finally ran to the gate just at the 15 minute before flight mark the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board i begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge we went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day so with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage we were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline by the way our flight from st lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left we had not eaten all day
8697,emirates,4,very disappointed,very disappointed when i approached the stewardess who was talking and laughing with a colleague and asked for a red wine she responded by saying it will be easier if you just go and ask at the kitchen at the back not the service you expect from emirates
4720,aurigny air,3,not the sort of service youd expect,left guernsey on time 730am with clear beautiful skies midway through flight there was a loud bang cutting a long story short we were all told an engine had blown and were going to make an emergency landing at stansted on the one remaining engine the stewardess who was great talked us through the crash procedure hands on head and when told to brace lean forward all very disturbing and scary we landed safely but not with twists and turns and were greeted by 5 fire vehicles we were told to collect our luggage and meet at a menzies counter and a coach would take us on to norwich no one came with us we waited in front of a monitor to see where our luggage was for 40 minutes luckily another passenger found ours we then struggled to find the menzies counter a lady briefly appeared telling us they were still trying to get a coach after 40 mins we were told to go to stop 34 which again a few of us failed to find easily boarded our coach and arrived in norwich 4 hours late without anyone greeting the coach when it arrived we were not even offered a cup of coffee to calm our nerves one lady said to me it was like they were blaming us not the sort of service youd expect after such a traumatic flight

60,adria airways,5,adria airways customer review,ltn to lju outbound with crj200 return with crj900 both legs on time just a tiny sandwich and only one round of drinks but ok for a 2 hr flight slow and unfriendly staff very little room in crj200 even though it was not full passengers had to pick up their luggage from hold upon arrival to lju and carry the bags to the terminal building
20493,thomson airways,7,seat pitch is very good,we travelled on the dreamliner to cancun and birmingham with thomson airways the seat pitch is very good in economy with a 333 configuration and although the overhead luggage are very spacious and plentiful you have to be careful that nobody is standing underneath them when you open them or else you will hit them there are not enough toilets in economy class with only 4 between over 200 passengers resulting in constant queues a major headache for people sitting near them especially the extra leg room seats when we took off the air conditioning vents that run along the side of the cabins started to drip the cabin staff were handing out paper towels to stuff on the vents and on looking along the cabin there were a lot up there already so obviously a major problem inflight entertainment was ok but not very new films offered
5170,ba cityflyer,5,a disappointing experience,zurich to london city airport no real business class experience the gate for this short haul flight was very unusually at terminal e some additional 15 minutes away from the main terminal luckily i had only little hand baggage and had checked in online before otherwise i would have missed the flight boarding was rather chaotic no special lane for business class the seats were okay but narrow and cramped as it was an early morning flight we got hot breakfast with was disappointing in quantity and quality the fruit salad looked tired no muesli nor yoghurt a disappointing experience but rather typical for flights to city airport
3579,airbaltic,5,not a smile or goodbye from the flight attendants,berlin to vilnius with airbaltic delayed by 45 minutes short flight seats were narrow and very little leg room i noticed 4 flight attendants 3 male and 1 female 2 of the 3 male flight attendants attended the business class passengers which there were none they sat at the business class seats for the majority of the flight the other male and 1 female flight attendants started selling drinks when we deplaned not a smile or goodbye from the flight attendants its ok they probably didnt speak english
1728,air france,8,a classic legacy carrier,a good return trip to puj in the caribbean with af from cdg they have a very solid product good quality food two services and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional additional drinks on demand ife is not to my taste but i am not a big user of ife if there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in english french and spanish which was a bit much also lights a bit bright at other times baggage handling and check in fine on both legs a good solid product from a classic legacy carrier
9359,fiji airways,9,flight was the best ever,sydney to los angeles via nadi flight was delayed due to a problem with aircraft they compensated on the stopover by putting us up in a nice hotel room service meals included the flight from nadi to los angeles was the best ever i was asked if i wanted a 4 seat row to myself when i already had a 3 seat to myself best sleep ever on a plane very happy with the level of service
15643,openskies,3,wreaked havoc on our vacation,orly to newark with openskies ticketed through british airways my sister and i were returning from barcelona through orly airport with a final destination of newark nj our flight arrived at orly airport at 855 am on jan 19th we had been unable to confirm our boarding passes in barcelona for the next leg of our flight because the british airways app would not allow it upon arriving we proceeded to the british airways counter only to find no associates present we were instructed by another airlines agent that british airways only staff the counter two hours prior to a flight we waited until they came to open the counter and were first in line to get our boarding passes we stayed in the area until closer time for our flight at approximately 1310 we went through security check and entered the boarding area our ticket showed gate 31 we were at gate 31 there were gates a b c d e and f as we looked at the monitor it showed that ba 8003 scheduled to depart at 1340 had closed the boarding process we immediately went to the gate and were told by the associate that the flight had already left the gate it wasnt even 1320 this was a flight scheduled to depart at 1340 and this is the time showing on the monitor the associate at the gate told us he would take us to the booking counter to see what they could do for us when we returned to the counter the time showing on my sisters fitbit was 1324 we were told we had missed our flight and it was taking off my sister showed the associate her fitbit time of 1332 and stated this plane should still be on the ground the associate at the gate stated that the flight departure time had been moved up 3 minutes i assured my sister to not worry that they were trying to help the agent was trying to locate our reservations and when she realized we had booked a travel package she informed us she could not help us other than to book tickets on the next days flight for 1500 per ticket and that we needed to contact our agent she also informed us that her colleague had called our names before closing the door i dont speak french but i do recognize my name and would have heard it if it had been announced after this information my sister again showed her the time on the fitbit which was 1337 and said this plane should still be on the ground i assured her we could not afford 3000 for one way tickets home i asked if there was anything else british airways openskies could do to make this right she said no youll have to contact your agent she was not interested in offering help once she realized we had not booked directly through british airways i am not sure what happened to make flight ba 8003 on january 19 depart early but it wreaked havoc on our vacation not to mention our wallets the real question it left with me however is how the airlines could have announced our names pulled our luggage from the plane and still managed to depart so early the airlines did respond but did not address many of the question that were raised with them customer relations essentially stated we are sorry for your experience
21544,utair aviation,5,utair aviation customer review,moscow to st petersburg flight was ok food was better than many airlines for flights that short check in for the flight was awfully organized several registration points were shared between a number of utair flights but obviously werent enough as there were crowds of passengers the personnel were slow i spent about 30 minutes in line the business class point was empty but the lady who worked there refused to register anyone else even late passengers and just kept reading something it was not before people had started calling for the representative realizing they were being late for boarding that the situation improved more or less i arrived 3 hours before the flight and finally managed to register only 10 minutes before the registration was closed
6102,british airways,3,they only had one choice of meal,due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg i cant describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible to ensure the passengers didnt get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way you wont get anything else for 12 hours you know the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid 11 for wifi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal was so weak i couldnt even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful what i dont understand is why it seems that british airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew
22431,volotea,9,our flight went very well,our flight from bordeaux to olbia in sardinia went very well with volotea we had no checked baggage we were subscribed to megavolotea and were able to bring a cabin suitcase a backpack just a little 30 min delay from bordeaux but almost caught up on arrival notre vol de bordeaux olbia en sardaigne sest trs bien pass sur la compagnie volotea nous navions pas de bagages en soutes nous tions abonns mgavolotea et avons pu emmener une valise cabine un sac dos juste un petit retard de 30 min au dpart de bordeaux mais presque rattrap larrive
14310,lynx air,1,disappointed on a massive scale,i flew with lynx air for 2 flights and both flights entered the top 2 worst flying experiences immediately you dont expect much of an airline when the price is low however even with low expectations lynx disappointed on a massive scale we sat on the tarmac for hours because they miscounted the number of passengers on the plane there was no renumeration for delaying the flight for hours and the pilot showed up to the flight 2 hours late please dont fly with them by the time you pay 100 for your carry on bag its better to pay the extra money to fly literally any other airline
14821,monarch airlines,9,service very good,i found the monarch airlines service very good the crew were very attentive and eager to assist the aircraft was clean the check in was quick and we landed early on the outward journey coming back the weather was very windy and we were advised that we may have to divert but the captain made a text book landing and we were 5 mins early i would certainly travel with monarch airlines again
8848,ethiopian airlines,7,value for money,a seriously underrated airline from africa the overall flight experience from mumbai to tel aviv and back was uneventful the quality of meals served was ok and the airline accommodates passengers in a threestar hotel when the layover is more than six hours value for money some room for improvement cleanliness of toilets

17970,sichuan airlines,7,no food and drink service during the flight,follow travel procedures carefully i traveled with them on the a350900 from cairo to chengdu due to travel restrictions in china there are procedures that must be followed in order to board the plane to travel to china with sichuan airlines the ticket price is very expensive and ranges between five and nine thousand us dollars for a oneway ticket from cairo to chengdu it is difficult to buy tickets online and you can buy them easily if you know someone in china who can buy them for you or through the companys page on wechat if you are traveling from a third country to egypt to travel with them you must take pcr tests for coronavirus covid19 three times within 48 and twentyfour hours before traveling in three different medical institutions recognized by the chinese embassy in that country and if the result of the virus tests is negative the chinese embassy will give you green light to travel to egypt upon arrival in cairo they will contact you to give you travel instructions that must be followed to travel to china from cairo and then they will add you to the group of travelers on wechat you must have an account on wechat you must take pcr tests for coronavirus covid19 two times before traveling in two different medical institutions recognized by the chinese embassy in cairo they will give you the address and name of the laboratories and the date and time of the tests on whatsapp the first pcr test is conducted fortyeight hours before travel and starts from seven in the morning until ten in the morning if the result of the pcr test is positive they will add you to another group on wechat and you cannot travel if the result of the pcr test is negative they will not contact you and you must do the test again on the day of travel on the day of travel the flight departs at around four oclock in the afternoon you must go to the laboratory to do a pcr test at exactly four oclock in the morning if the result of your examination is positive they will cancel your travel and add you to another group on wechat if the result of the pcr test is negative they will not contact you and you must go to the airport to complete your travel procedures 7you should apply for the electronic health codes you can fill in the information declare your health status and upload relevant documents online you must obtain it before traveling and it is preferable that you do so upon your arrival at the sichuan airlines counter at cairo airport and before completing your other travel procedures you must wear a hazmat suit the airline staff will prevent you from boarding the plane if you are not wearing it and it can be purchased from any medical supplies store in the kasr alaini area in cairo at a cheap price you must wear a face mask during the whole flight the company does not provide food and drink service during the flight upon boarding the plane you will find a plastic bag tied in front of your seat containing some snacks and a small bottle of water you must tell the flight crew if you want to use the bathroom as they sterilize it after any passenger uses it in general the flight from cairo to chengdu was quiet and comfortable
176,aegean airlines,6,overall experience is very pleasant,staff are friendly and the overall experience from ground and cabin crew is very pleasant families were given priority when flying from athens and luggage is usually checked in at no cost if within sizeweight limit seats are fairly tight as expected but overall pretty comfortable planes are new with usb charging on board and if you are lucky a basic onboard wifi streaming service food quality is really bad a tiny cold sandwich served in a very environmentallyunfriendly card box drinks choice is ok the part that lets this airline down is cleanliness i expect a spotless cabin only to find carpets are dirty which is surprising for a brand new plane seats have no headrest cover and toilets the worst i have ever seen on a plane
12837,kenya airways,6,very weak point is the food,bangkok to johannesburg via nairobi on 5th february 2020 both flights on newer b7878 aircrafts checkin and luggage handling went smoothly but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my bps issued on spot booking handling online works well their afklm lounge offered in bangkok is poor like thai airways lounges but their pride lounge in nairobi is good and spacious hardware on kenya airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues the fas are also good plenty observant they are mainly kenyans which does not help chinese nor thai passengers much the very weak point of kenya airways is the food business class does not provide food any better than their economy class and is plain without vision looking shabby competing airlines like ethiopian turkish south african and egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class steel cutlery and table preparation nice but thats it dinner from bkk was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice very poor offerings no meat no cocktails no cheeses no ice cream no smoothies chocolates no fruits watermelon does not count extremely poor catering a disgrace for the airline beverages are shamefully very sparse only 2 juices apple or orange are offered wines are only passable beers are cheap waterish industrial stuff 2 brands tusker and heineken not providing any alternatives to each other no souvenir no pyjamas no luxury feelings at all no lobster no seafood no caviar no mutton goat pork no beef no chicken maybe inside the breakfast sausage fa staff admitted that economy class had the same catering as business though of course presented simpler 1st flight on time 2nd departed 1 hour late miles given quickly to flying blue i will go again when the price is right lower expectation to food to zero and eat well at home or in lounge then it can be fairly good value for money when prices are promoted
12720,karthago airlines,3,karthago airlines customer review,flight to monastir they were on time outboundinbound the plane was cramped and spent the flight with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me i was in the very back row 25 on the way back though it wasnt as bad in the middle of the plane seats ripped arms broken fabric coming off bits of metal sticking out comments regarding food is true worst ever plane food found the cabin crew okay but i do speak some arabic so that helped they loved that

16114,play,3,horrible inflight experience,just horrible inflight experience and not even that cheap by the time youre done paying for bags and seats im not sure its any cheaper particularly when you consider how much longer it is to fly through iceland the planes are so basic genuinely had better amenities on a greyhound bus 6 hour flight without even a free glass of water no power outlets no in flight entertainment of any type boarding is a hot mess all 4 times its unclear where priority lines are or who should be boarding and when and then everyone just boards all at once with people at the bag putting their bags at the front which screws up the deplaning very poorly organized only positive thing i can say is all the flights were on time
15446,oman air,9,i was very happy with everything about this flight,final leg of my trip home to london i was very happy with everything about this flight the food cabin crew seat comfort and punctuality ive had a really great experience with oman air over the last month and really rate them highly my only criticism of oman air is that on this flight i bought one of their overpriced wifi packages as i needed to do some work emails and the wifi is painfully slow whilst i realise at 40000ft i cant expect lightning fast at almost 40 it should be better
11935,jazeera airways,4,jazeera airways customer review,kwilcakwi paid extra for jazeera plus but not worth it it is better to buy the basic product and then take advantage of the upgrade offered onboard at kd25 however although the only supposed advantage here is that whereas with jazeera plus the middle seat is blockedoff if the upgrade is taken the middle seat is used quite who collects the upgrade fees is unclear it looks like it is shared amongst the fas aircraft a newish airbus a320 flight deck crew an international mixture with almost unintelligible announcements but good at their jobs fas on outward flight bored and uninterested but more professional on the return flight seats leather covered in light grey and reasonably comfortable inflight snacks paidfor but reasonable in quantity and quality ontime departure both ways generally a good performance for a lowcost airline and gives the local legacy carriers pause for thought regarding their fares and services in the regional market
2106,air madagascar,6,information about delay was bad,antananarivo to majunga flight was operated by ewa two hours late and information about the delay was bad aircraft was a little bit old friendly fa some refreshments served fare a little bit high
20524,tianjin airlines,5,price alone will not judge its success,shenyang to london gatwick via tianjin a new route recently opened between london gatwick and tanjian and as a regular traveller between the uk and china i felt it was worth giving it a go the initial pick up from shenyang was easy enough a small domestic flight between shenyang and tianjin as my flight to london wasnt until the following morning tianjin airlines would provide 3 star accommodation for the night free of charge whilst this was communicated during the initial booking no details were given in an email i arrive into tianjin with a man telling me to ring this number for the hotel pick up the process was badly organised the hotel did not speak a word of english or very broken english i was told that the hotel was full and no rooms were available there is no visible desk for tianjin airlines within the airport at tianjin which i find ludicrous i relied on a local tourist desk for help eventually i found my way to the hotel where again i was told no room or i would have to pay 350 rmb for a room eventually another passenger was experiencing the same problem and spoke perfect mandarin crisis averted overall the experience was very poorly managed no clear visibility at the airport and unclear instructions the hotel room was pleasant enough similar to an ibis or travelodge clean with air conditioning when booking the website clearly advertised the route as tianjin to london gatwick with no stops bar internal domestic flight from shenyang in the end we had to stop at chongqing for two hours the main flight to london gatwick was standard long haul unlimited water and soft drinks chinese style food with a snack the drinks service was given after the food service which i found strange when compared to other providers the food was okay the inflight entertainment was terrible or nonexistent normally long haul flights will have a good selection of international films everything was pretty much chinese except for the it crowd so random for an 11 hour flight you need a decent selection to pass the time the flight itself totalled 34 hours travel time i normally pay between 540 560 with china southern total travel time is normally around the 2627 hour mark the new route between tianjin and gatwick only cost 335 if you book earlier you can sometimes get it for 275 one way perhaps the amount you pay is reflected in the experience overall with no flight delays and a competent service the new route between tianjin and london gatwick offers good value for money however the difficulties encountered in communicating the hotel diversion to chongqing not highlighted on website and lack of in flight entertainment for european customers lacked the finesse rival airlines provide if the new route is to succeed price alone will not judge its success the carrier must provide a like for like experience considering the nature of other long haul providers offering a more well rounded experience
17481,salam air,6,good value for money,dubai to kuwait via muscat i had 2 flights with salam air first leg from dubai to muscat was amazing it was on an a320n aircraft new seats friendly crew and very clean aircraft probably one of the best lowcosters or so i thought had a 4 hour connection in muscat the new airport is stunning as good as hamad airport in doha time flew by very fast in the free lounges in the airport but my second flight was a whole lot different the plane was very old 22 years a320200 seats were worn out plane smelled and during the flight the inner cover of the window fell out i called the purser and the following was our conversation me hello your window fell out purser my brother dont worry plane good quality fly 20 years never crash noted but the cabin crew was still rather friendly overall for the price i would recommend it my flight from dxb to kwi via mct with a bad was 309aed good value for money
14815,monarch airlines,1,absolutely no communication,due to high winds in manchester the plane diverted to east midlands we were to be bussed to manchester that seems to be as much as monarch were going to be responsible for no announcements were made once we got into the very depressing east midlands airport we stood around outside in dreadful weather waiting for buses absolutely no communication ok the weather no one to blame but absolutely no excuse for the abysmal lack of communication first flight with monarch dont anticipate a second east midlands airport was inundated with diverted planes because of the weather they had an unenviable job
1596,air europa,3,no excuse for their behaviour,this flight was bound to go wrong before it even took off 230 am flight leaving alghero arriving in madrid at 430 the inbound fight from madrid had taken off at midnight so the crew were already exhausted there was still no excuse for their behaviour no welcoming or good byes to any passengers no service and literally yelling at three older couples who had forgotten to put their mask on before entering the flight instead of politely informing them the flight was the only one leaving alghero at night forget the shops that were obviously closed there was not even a possibility to buy water at the airport prior to the flight vending machines empty this flight needs to be moved earlier or by all means later but the airport and cabin crew of air europa could not handle it on this occasion
4660,asiana airlines,6,a recommendable airline,seoul to shanghai at the boarding gate airline members carried out an accurate weight and sizeinspection of carry on luggage seats were comfortable enough for this 2hourflight in flight entertainment selection is mediocre flight attendants are very strict with drinks being brought into the cabin i carried a beverage which i bought in the departure hall when they caught me sipping at it they requested me to give it up and started making a fuss over it meals were served during the short flight quality was acceptable considering the bargain ticket a recommendable airline

14458,malaysia airlines,8,the leg room was generous,the flight from langkawi to singapore was a twoflight combination using the b737800 i had booked and paid for exit row 14 on both sectors and the leg room was generous on the first leg wifi streaming entertainment was available while on the second segment personal tv was available as i was seated at the exit window seat 14a the left armrest was a truncated armrest so that it will not block the emergency exit both flight sectors were around 1 hour and shortly after take off a packet of peanuts and orange juice was served being such short flights nothing more was expected
14835,monarch airlines,8,monarch airlines customer review,manchester man palma pmi efficient check in service at manchester the flight was on time and upon arrival at the aircraft the crew were very welcoming we departed 25 minutes late however this was not due to monarch it was due to the large amount of flights at manchester that morning lots of the variety for snacks and drinks however maybe a little overpriced i purchased a meal deal 750 this was very tasty not much legroom and little uncomfortable i have to admit i prefer the old monarch interior than the new one though landed on time and good updates from the cockpit palma pmi manchester man again efficient check in service at palma with the iberia ground staff again i had the meal deal it was the old monarch interior the seats were more comfortable more legroom and just generally nicer and brighter cabin cabin crew were fantastic and really enjoyed the flight i would fly with monarch again and it was great value for money

13433,lao airlines,9,staff friendly and courteous,luang prabang to chiang mai first flew with them as lao aviation many years ago that was a risky business but today lao airlines is as different as chalk and cheese everything about them is different the aircraft are modern and well maintained with clean interiors staff are friendly and courteous ontime performance is goo all in all a great little airline flew e sectors an airbus lpqvtelpq and an atr72 to chiangmai as good as any other international airline the catering is not as good as it could be but as most sectors are less than an hour it is understandable
21737,vietnam airlines,7,they board us by bus,hanoi to ho chi minh city i fly with vietnam airlines a lot i am their gold level frequent flyer i always like the staff consideration the food and to some extend the comfort of the cabin however there are 2 things that they really need to improve they use too many times the bus to bring the customer from gate to the airplane i got a bad experience today it is 35 degree in hanoi and they board us by bus as the sky priority customer i got to board first there is a stairs to bring us from gate to the bus the problem is that i have to wait under the heat for about 5 minute before the bus arrive this should not be the way an airline should treat its customer entertainment on aircraft is quite poor on a 2 hour domestic flight for a321 aircraft
20723,tigerair australia,1,simply not good enough,adelaide to melbourne all too familiar review for tigerair but i want to let people know that tigers word is not final i had my flight cancelled from adelaide to melbourne which i understand things like this happen what i dont accept is the way the situation was managed to be offered a flight 2 days later is simply not good enough especially because they could see i had a return flight the next day with them i told the customer service operator that i had to get to melbourne that day as i had a concert to which the response was i understand that well clearly she didnt as the alternative given was a flight on a monday when the concert was on a saturday i was told there were no other available flights despite there being another tigerair flight available online for later in the afternoon i had to purchase tickets with another carrier when i returned i sent a claim to tigerair for my out of pocket expenses that being the difference between the tigerair fare and the fare on the other airline not the full cost of the other tickets tiger reviewed the information and informed me that i had insufficient evidence to be reimbursed i think they bank on people giving up at this point im more stubborn than that a quick google search and i found the airline customer advocate one email to them and their tune changed immediately and i was offered the reimbursement straight off the bat i urge people to use this service and not take tigerairs response as final
21474,us airways,3,us airways customer review,us airways though merged with american still retains the legacy of being the worst carrier when it comes to service i am not complaining that they dont provide any food or baggage services etc but basic courteous behavior among the staff was absent my flight was after 800pm and when asked why the food items listed on the inflight menu were not available i was rudely told that the timings are mentioned in the menu the steward could have told me this more politely i flew on american on dfwbos leg and at least they gave me a full can of beverage but while flying on aircraft operated by us airways i was served only a small quantity of the beverage in a glass filled mostly with ice
4168,american airlines,2,they delay for no reason,american has literally managed to screw every one of my family members on three separate occasions they delay for no reason and when they delay it is so excessive that connecting flights are missed do not fly american you will regret it it cost me 830 to rebook with another airline i only got a refund of 300 worst experience ever my son is now going to be stuck in new york because of their stupid delays

3632,aircalin,3,absolute rubbish service,absolute rubbish service today at the start and the end check in line for economy was huge i had a qantas ticket codeshare and am platinum with qantas so attempted to use the premium queue which was not permitted despite not having clients premium checkin desks were not servicing economy clients preferring to chat amongst themselves flight was ok on arrival no carousel information and bags took over 30 mins to commence delivery a pa on were sorry for late delivery and miss communication really doesnt equate to being a reasonable service i wont fly air calin again

7111,china united airlines,6,the ticket price is cheap,the reason for taking china united airlines this time is that the ticket price is cheapfor the air tickets between beijing and shanghai the prices of other airlines are more than 1000 yuan only china united airlines is 535 yuan because it is a lowcost airline there is no free checked luggage the staff at the ground counter have a very good attitude and high efficiency there is almost no queuing phenomenon china united airlines has only 737 aircraft and it has a full economy class layout compared with other lowcost airlines everyone of china united airlines has sent a bottle of water which is good i bought the meal through the app in advance but it was obviously not so delicious and affordable the seat cant be adjusted there is no entertainment system no small tv no wifi in the whole cabin which is very bad
15443,oman air,8,highly recommend it,the service and comfort was fairly decent for the price paid good ife with a responsive screen and a recent selection of movies an aperitif was served main dish was good the crew is friendly and passed several times to bring water alcohol was served the only letdown was the breakfast which was only a pie but this is a short flight only 7h overall on par with emirates at a third of the price highly recommend it
3175,airasia,1,not worth the trouble,be careful on the air asia site as you think you are booking through air asia and then suddenly you are booking the flights you selected through kiwicom but it still looks like air asia my flights were rescheduled to the next day but i was not notified i turned up at the airport to find out my flight wouldnt be until the next day air asia blamed kiwicom and kiwicom blamed air asia i was not offered any compensation for the lost accommodation fees or expensive uber to the airport nothing neither air asia or kiwicom would accept any responsibility i hate to think what wouldve happened if i had a connecting flight do not book through air asia or kiwicom its not worth the trouble
3176,airasia,9,so nice to welcome back airasia,its so nice to welcome back airasia after almost a 2 years absence since the start of the pandemic after having had a few bad experience with malaysia airlines quite recently i chose air asia for the value of money on christmas day flight was on time check in at the airport was orderly premium flex customers perks and priority were observed boarding by the zone was very orderly also plane is clean and crew were lovely and welcoming it really pays to get the exit row for the extra leg room and comfort my preordered meal of bukhara chicken rice was delicious ad spicy and it came with a small bottle of water i was impressed at how efficient the crew worked and they kept the 2 toilets clean at regular intervals as well landing was so smooth too luggage delivered in a timely manner and in good condition for someone who is used to flying premium airlines in business class i must say this was a very inoressive experience i think in future for medium to short haul flights i really dont mind to fly with them and save some money as well maybe party is also because nowadays many premium airlines cut costs so much that more and more they resemble budget airlines except for the price tag

7905,cubana airlines,6,cubana airlines customer review,cunhav we flew both legs of our journey on a newish tu204 which is similar to the 757 to be truthful i was disappointed that the flights werent on the yak42d the tu204 was modern and comfortable although the seats were a bit hard flight staff were friendly and attentive enough certainly on par with their us counterparts which probably isnt saying much the only downside was that both flights took off about an hour late
4662,asiana airlines,5,service was soso,took oz754 from singapore to seoul and was assigned a flight without any personal inflight entertainment i am very surprised at this service was soso food portion and taste was also ok the only good thing is that the leg room is wider i will not consider taking asiana again for my next korea trip
8194,eastern airways,9,would happily recommend,southampton to leeds bradford with eastern airways and found the flight pleasant boarding quick and cabin crew seemed friendly enough the flight was a little pricey but then all internal flights are aircraft saab 2000 was in good shape but you could tell its age judging by the decor of the cabin but seats were quite comfortable was a bit annoying as on the return flight my seat reclined when i leaned back without me pressing the button overall a good flight and would happily recommend to anyone
17468,safi airways,4,safi airways customer review,i used safi airways twice over the last 2 weeks from dubai to kabul and back again i used safi airways because it appears to be the only airline that has international safety standards certification the aircraft were clean but i was shocked at the state of the aircraft generally the seats were bent out of alignment in some rows the lights above were cracked and flickered when used and the windows were badly scratched and the plastic slides and surrounds damaged it has made me think twice about using them again the aircraft they are using must be some 30 years old and badly need replacing
21284,turkmenistan airlines,6,turkmenistan airlines customer review,ashgabat dashoguz return on b717 outbound had interesting boarding arrangements you get a numbered generic boarding pass with a picture of an ilyushin 76 cargo plane on it and you have to refer to your ticket for your seat number at least the seat allocation is honoured aircraft interior was comfortable and well presented they now have safety cards but still no sick bags and no life jackets picture of the president is displayed on the front bulkhead small sandwich served and additional items can be purchased at prices lower than those at ashgabat airport landing was not the most confident look out for the fleet of antonov an 2s at dashoguz airport inbound also interesting no conventional checkin counters everyone queues at a plain doorway for security etc no boarding passes aircraft interior was clean and well presented i didnt use the bathroom but others reported it was not in a good state snack consisted of two buns which were so dry they were almost impossible to eat both flights were on time for usd37 return i have no complaints

11268,iberia express,3,totally appalling experience,i flew business class to las palmas from cardiff flights excellent and ontime i couldnt fault their performance what overshadowed the whole trip was the way in which i was treated in madrid airport by a gate clerk i entered the wrong line for priority boarding and eventually was able to join the correct line for some reason this angered the woman at the gate who decided to explode with anger at me for no reason about why i was in the wrong queue etc i was so shocked by her behaviour when i told her off for speaking to me in such an aggressive way and i took back my passport with a curt thank you she ran down the jetty leaving her desk and other passengers to verbally abuse me more i have never experienced anything quite like it in 15 years of flying iberia i put in a complaint about her behviour but heard nothing back totally appalling experience and never again

5557,belavia,1,belavia customer review,flight from warsaw to minsk was on time and uneventful transit at minsk was impossible because the airport has no facilities to process transit passengers all passengers with connecting flights were herded into a hot stuffy room for an hour until the man in a green uniform who had the key to the door to the main minsk terminal decided to appear by that time most connecting flights had departed including my flight to kiev belavia staff tried hard spoke little english said i would have to sleep in the airport as my passport was ineligible for a transit visa on arrival and travel on the morning flight to kyiv 14 hours later nothing offered not even a bottle of water for the inconvenience to be fair it was the fact that minsk airport does not work for transit passengers that was the issue but belavia must be aware of this and should not sell connecting flights i am sure belavia is fine for point to point travel but it and minsk airport is unable to cope with connecting flights
21872,virgin australia,3,did not let us know until we arrive at airport,virgin cancelled our flight from sydney to perth on the 14 december 2022 and did not let us know until we arrive at airport then booked us to perth via brisbane and only just made the flight then a 10 hour wait before flying to perth arriving at perth airport the next morning missing a whole day in perth with out of pocket costs for three meals luggage storage and taxi fare we also paid our travel agent 200 extra to get a early flight which was more wasted money
14291,lynx air,2,avoid this airline,total nightmare booked flights for a round trip from toronto to st johns not worth the savings the level of stress of having to deal with their ridiculous level of unreliability is just too much they tell you to be there at least a couple hours early and then delay your flight by at least a few hours we were at the airport at 5 am for a 720 am flight and didnt take off until 1020 am theyll keep you having to check for delays constantly because theyll just keep furthering an original delay and then have you sit on the tarmac for ages the way back from st johns to toronto was unbelievably even worse a two and a half hour delay and an additional hour and a half sitting on the tarmac in toronto just waiting for our gate to be available with very little communication from staff until people started getting angry made for a harrowing 7 hour ordeal all for what was supposed to be a quick 3 hour flight could have flown to europe by then avoid this airline its just not worth it
8696,emirates,3,worst airline to deal with,emirates has been the worst airline to deal with in terms of customer service my mother travelled from mumbai to houston with a bag below maximum weight in spite of that the bag came with a wheel torn off when we reported at the airline service desk they took pictures and assured us that it would be processed very quickly this was on march 25th as of may 3rd nothing we called the call centers multiple numbers got handed around from one department to another who finally said keep emailing as no one at the call center or baggage services number can help spoke to a supervisor from baggage services and all she could say was please send the email to claims i cannot help why is it called baggage services then my mom flies back in a few days and we are being forced to buy a new bag for her while waiting for emirates to respond to a simple damaged bag claim such a hassle if anything goes wrong
20398,thomas cook airlines,3,the cabin crew service was very poor,i flew from gatwick to cape town on the 25 dec which was not a good experience and ended up more expensive than any of the main long haul airlines if thomas cook is going to fly long haul they need to follow the example of long haul airlines we were charged 40 for baggage each way 3 for headset 5 for the movies which were old 450 for a drink even for water the food was terrible we did not even have a choice ran out before they got to us the cabin crew service was very poor at one stage there was three drinks trolleys in a row extremely disorganised the return trip on 10 jan was much better the cabin crew and food much improved i feel if thomas cook wants to charge for everything as they do for short haul flights passengers need to be notified as this is not the normal procedure i very much doubt i will use this airline for long haul flights again
20139,thai lion air,2,ridiculous policy on carryon,bangkok to chiang mai ridiculous policy on carryon bags if your bag weighs more than 7k you have to take items out of your bag and hold them i ended up walking with my backpack neck pillow toiletry bag running shoes and make up bag it was so inconvenient that i just put my stuff back in my bag but there was another scale at the gate before boarding so we had to go through the process again when we got on the plane we stowed the carry on bags and just put all the extra items up in the overhead compartments completely defeating the purpose of lightening our bags once seated my partner and i took out our lunches that wed packed only to be told that in fact outside food isnt allowed on the planethere were no signs or announcements outlining this policy we had to sneak bites of our food during the flight when we landed the airline operated shuttle bus was broken and we had to stand in the isles holding all of our items that had been pulled from our bags for 25 minutes overall it was a pretty funny experience weird policies attempt to make more money by charging baggage fees and making people buy food on the plane and one inconvenience after another
6384,cape air,4,cape air customer review,bosalbogs leg 1 we were about 10 minutes late due to weather cant control mother nature we more than made up for the delay by arriving a little bit early we had a great tail wind leg 2 arrived 15 minutes early i grew up with this airline and hope it continues on into the future
17600,saudi arabian airlines,7,crew were very attentive courteous,my flight was sv571 that was actually quite a decent one going to jeddah for the weekend to watch the f1 races taking place on march 18 check in went alright there was not much inflight entertainment available on the plane was alright but i consider it as average my meal was really tasty which was a cheese pizza type of pastry served with apple juice as well the crew were very attentive courteous and spoke english very well to all of the passengers i would recommend saudia for travels in the middle east as it is one of the cheapest fares for flights and for travels the only hassle was the ground staff in jeddah the immigration lines were horrendous and needed some improvements i know jeddah airport is quite big and could easily get crowded especially when you arrive at 700pm the interesting part of jeddah airport was it had lots of food and beverages outlets available in the arrivals corridor
2371,air moldova,7,decent professional airline,stansted to chiinu pros friendly and helpful staff quick easy checkin at airport free hold baggage and generous cabin baggage tasty fresh complimentary food and wine onboard all far better than i expected cons plane was over an hour late although the staff were very apologetic i think their timetables simply arent robust enough dont have enough slack time and airport turnaround not sufficiently efficient our flight was a late evening flight and having looked at their flight history in general the earlier in the day the flight is the more reliable it seems to be its also relatively expensive but then theres not much competition on flights to chiinu from london overall this is a decent professional airline that looks after you well but it has some scheduling issues to sort out to improve punctuality
14793,monarch airlines,9,extra leg room was brilliant,flew gatwick to tenerife with monarch no negative reviews dont usually use monarch but will consider them for future flights good service excellent cabin crew food was was good and the drinks trolley came around twice extra leg room was brilliant i am 6ft 5ins tall and felt very comfortable in these seats
3493,airasia x,8,food was a very small portion,kuala lumpur to perth with airasia x midnight departure and the boarding gate was crowded and cramped managed by a solitary attendant the pa system was scratchy and he could hardly be understood boarding was not organised on board attendants were efficient but not overtly friendly they were a bit slow in giving out blankets but once done the lights were switched off and the whole cabin was horizontal announcements on the plane were awful especially the safety announcement the flight attendant spoke fast and her words were not clear there was only one attendant displaying the safety procedures in the business cabin and i could hardly see him from the other side of the aircraft where i was seated they seemed rushed in everything that they did or were they trying to be efficient the food was a very small portion of coconut rice and spicy sambal nasi lemak which was gone in five spoonfuls not worth the money for that tiny meal the rest of the flight was uneventful
736,air arabia,1,never will recommend,i am never flying with this airline again and never will recommend to anybody i flew with air arabia the first time in 2017 and then i left my pandora under my seat which i bought from armenia on my way back to uae i called customer service several times but nobody was ever willing to help me and just simply said we found nothing so thats when i know this airline cannot be trusted or perhaps its crew 2023 came and my friends decided to book with air arabia because its cheaper so i had no choice but to go with them although ive already warned them how horrible the service of this airline is we checked in online via the air arabia app and when we arrived at the airport the online check in we did was actually useless as we still had to queue like the others who did not do the online one they couldve put up a separate counter for those who did the online check in like how we have in dubai also all the crew of this airline looks so evidently unhappy with their jobs that it is reflecting in their service getting inside the plane nobody would even smile or even look at you i asked a crew to help me put my luggage up the cabin as i am a little short to reach and she said you have to help me because i cannot put it up myself
4650,asiana airlines,8,the staff were exemplary,sydney to istanbul via seoul wonderful staff and even though it was an older plane the seat was comfortable with good legroom unfortunately the entertainment choices were limited and the equipment was poor and old luckily the korean films were very entertaining and had english subtitles because none of the other world movies did the plane was delayed one hour on the runway in sydney whilst they waited for the meals and again when a passenger didnt feel well however we made up the time in the air the sydney to incheon leg was a day flight leaving in the morning however the blinds were closed for the 9 hour trip the same happened from incheon to istanbul again a day flight of 9 hours so it was quite stuffy particularly because the cabin temperature was warm i preferred the excellent korean food over the western meal and kept hydrated with tonnes of water rather than trying their alcohol all flights were full but the staff were exemplary remaining patient and smiling the toilets were surprisingly always clean and in order
9996,flysafair,3,i had to give up my bag,i sat in seat 3e which is right behind the exit row seats this is considered a premium seat which i paid for as all frequent flyers know the exit row needs to be kept clear and passengers normally would put their bags in the overhead bins for takeoff as per instructions please place all bags in overhead bins or under the seat in front of you safair has a policy of allowing and recommending that the exit row places their bags under their own seat i ended up sitting in a so called premium seat with a large bag where i would normally place my small bag and my feet i complained but cabin crew confirmed that this is policy and i had to give up my bag to be placed in overhead bin i never got it back till i had landed so i could not read my book i think everyone and all other airlines can see the problem with this policy i would never put my bag where someone elses feet go there is the obvious theft opportunity and possible damage if some kicked your bag anyway warning to all about premium seat and weird policies the seats are also pretty small
14614,mandarin airlines,7,be wary of luggage scales,flew mandarin airlines an ofshoot of china airlines from taichung in taiwan to hong kong checkin although relatively quick was a problem in that my baggage seemed to weigh 29 kg and the counter attendant was adament that i had to pay excess luggage explained to her that my luggage had weighed 20 kg a week earlier flying to taiwan and there was no additional items she would not listen and in a loud voice repeated her call for me to pay extra fortunately my taiwanes colleague who was seeing me of noticed that when i took by luggage of the scales indicated 9kg she reset it and my luggage now weighed 20 kg she was not graceful about her mistake the flight itself was pleasant reasonable leg pitch a nice wrap for breakfast with good coffee and pleasant staff will fly this airline again but will be wary of wrongly set luggage scales
331,aeroflot russian airlines,1,fantastic customer services,lyon to moscow via delhi fantastic customer services i had a cancelled flight with another operator so missed my long haul called the free helpline and the service was excellent and every easily resolved i have flown a few times with aeroflot and have always been very surprised at how good and easy the customer services are thankyou
11969,jet airways,2,worst airline ever,mumbai to amsterdam worst airline ever i flight to delhi on april 6th plane was dirty old food basic no entertaiment on board what is more on the way back the flight was cancelled and i needed to wait in mumbai for two days now it is not possible to get any refund from the airline as the ticket was bought via company in europe if they ever start to operate again do not buy tickets from that airline
21190,turkish airlines,6,be prepared for screwups,check in fine but the tsa pre check did not show up even though i had provided all the info and confirmed that by phone lounge shared star alliance at lax tired dirty hot crowded did find outdoor space which was a relief was there about and hour and a half saw no one picking up dirty plates glasses napkins got to gate 15 mins before boarding was to start told to wait here and well make an announcement for boarding boarding started 35 mins after scheduled time no announcements eventually an employee said business line up over there and theres a long line of people who probably were given different info not a huge issue but the bad experience kept getting more irritating the plane fine well equipped very helpful and welcoming staff but theres poor info on the website about the seats seat map shows 2 seats an aisle and 2 seats seat map of tk website is not accurate its actually one seat an aisle two seats an aisle and one seat so we were a couple on a 13 hour flight separated by an aisle and the two seats were offset by approximately 15 inches so we couldnt even converse across the aisle not a fatal flaw but an example of sloppiness we took off an hour late with no explanation or a were sorry comment which would have been a nice touch so trying to balance it out with a real life experience im still answering yes id recommend it but be prepared for screwups and if you are two flying together take the middle two business class seats on this equipment
19908,thai airasia,2,two hours wrestling with a website,the flight itself is adequate the disaster that is air asias broken reservations and customer service system is another matter the issue was to pay the equivalent of usd5 in additional baggage two hours wrestling with a website that generates error message after error message and payment doesnt go through on 4 valid credit cards asked my travel agent to try to resolve and they confirmed it was not possible to pay the charge online i ended up taking a taxi to the airport and back to pay this charge airasias own personnel were embarrassed by the whole thing if you manage to buy a ticket and not have to make any changes at all you might be all right otherwise fly another airline i certainly will from now on
15512,oman air,4,bags a week after my arrival,melbourne to tehran via muscatabu dhabi i received my bags a week after my arrival in tehran because they engaged another airline etihad to do the first part of the journey my bags were held in abu dhabi the staff in tehran were rude and unhelpful trying to avoid accepting the responsibility i think this company is far from being an international professional airline they are known for missing bags the second issue was the extremely expensive cost of rebooking a flight once you miss one flight it cost me 1300 australian dollars to rebook my flight from abu dhabi to melbourne
17208,rwandair,6,not a bad airline,the routing was nairobientebbekigalilusakajohannesburg crazy itinerary however a good deal in terms of ticket price first flight from nairobi to kigali was satisfactory a330 from kigali to lusaka and joburg offered lots of comfort with hot breakfast and hot snack served later ife was pretty pathetic on flights where it was available and otherwise non existent on the return a terrible sandwich was served followed by a hot dinner overall not a bad airline the cabin crew were very friendly however ground services staff seem to be overwhelmed especially when we flew the a330 checkin was very slow both in nairobi and in johannesburg was told i was not on the list when arrived at jnb for checkin and all except two departures were slightly delayed without any explanation or any information given good airline if youre trying to save money
10945,hawaiian airlines,5,the food was very poor,staff are lovely but the food was very poor you dont even get a bread roll i am a small person so i was ok but for a man not sure how they would go however they were very generous when it came to wine
7447,condor airlines,3,rude and miserable people,the worst airline i have flown with ground staff at frankfurt are rude and icy beyond belief the aggressive woman at the gate frankfurt was refusing to allow me to go to the toilet when i pointed out they had not provided toilets and that i needed to go she reluctantly agreed but snarled that she would unload me if the bus arrived on my return she threw my ticket at me the bus arrived 30 minutes later i have flown twice to anchorage with them cabin crew give the impression they do not want to be there if you do see a smile it appears forced and fake its as if they resent doing their job food was just about edible pasta tubes with a sauce on both legs no water for first two hours on return flight and no ability to purchase water after security at anchorage north terminal all entertainment has to be paid for check in is at anc south terminal departure is from the north terminal of course condor do not tell anyone this so people wandering the terminal looking lost check in staff at anchorage were pleasant enough they are not condor staff this airline could learn a lot from the likes of virgin on employing the right type of staff i wish there was another airline that flew direct to anchorage that is as cheap as condor until then we will have to suck it up with these rude and miserable people
7842,cubana airlines,9,i would fly cubana at any time,toronto to caya coco flight out on time staff provided a lovely breakfast sandwich with juice and dessert coffeewater served for free beer wine offered at a very modest price touchdown early on return again flight on time arrival very early than expected sandwich lunch again for no charge and coffee and water with all the other airlines charging for every scrap of amenities i dont understand what people complain about and the washrooms did not smell i would fly cubana at any time
960,air austral,9,air austral customer review,flew air austral sydrunmauritiusrunsyd it is 100 better then air mauritius the food was great and flight attendants were excellent and friendly ive got a 19 month old so they kept the middle seat for us free and they kept offering to help and asked if everything was ok the only drawback is theres no ptv and not much info from cockpit
398,aeroflot russian airlines,3,seats hard leg space good,delhi to moscow flight left on time and reached on time seats hard but leg space good inflight entertainment was problematic to operate press something and something else comes up on the screen no free alcohol served on this flight food served after an hour and a half after take off and meant to be breakfast was terrible and small portions of food next food an hour and a half before arrival a small snack box i will carry my own food with me from moscow back to delhi worse than a low cost airline
7272,cityjet,8,cityjet customer review,lcydub first time out of london city and it was a breeze to get to from central london flight on avro rj85 on time and very pleasant when compared to say ryanair from lgw online check in good although make sure that you allocate your seats away from rows 68 as the overhead lockers are only good for brief cases and not wheelie weekend bags as a result my friends bag was taken along with others at the departure gate and put in the hold so if you want to get a quick getaway at the other end you may want to pack a smaller bag or backpack in flight service was good and complementary alcoholic drinks served with a sandwich dublcy didnt have the chance to print my boarding pass so went to the desk who printed it off for me on time departure to lcy professional staff city jet is a great service and a relaxing alternative to lgw and lhr to dub
21481,us airways,6,us airways customer review,us airways express we arrived very early for an afternoon flight and asked if possible to change to earlier flight customer service lady very kind and helpful changed it to 1115 am flight no extra charge boarding smoothly small plane allocated 2 seats and prefer that configuration only 1 flight attendant with a good sence of humour we were unaware that flight from philadelphia to new york was only 19 minutes so quickest flight we have ever been on only negative is we prefer life jackets in case of emergency not flotation cushions on bottom of seats the main thing is we arrived safely
1085,air berlin,7,fare was cheap and my expectations were low,the paris to berlin flight from paris orly was confusing i thought it departed from orly west as other one world flights but it actually departs from orly sud the flight was ok no beverage service not even a drop of water air berlin fare was cheap and my expectations were low the good things is that as a sapphire member of other carrier my checked bag fee is waived so i have reason to be satisfied
20371,thomas cook airlines,8,impressed with the flight,manchester to los angeles really impressed with the flight i was dreading the 11 hour flight but the cabin was spacious decent legroom the staff were really efficient and friendly and the food was edible frequent though better on the way out their us supply chain has a way to go decent selection of films if you upgrade only 5 tv and music i would recommend thomas cook if you can get a good deal but if go with virginba if its a similar price on the flight back we were given a pillowblanket each night flight and the toilets were down a set of stairs so a good space to stretch the premium films were all free on the way back i think if a good sleep is an absolute necessity pay for premium as the seats looking to recline more and looking more comfortable
10973,hi fly,8,well trained and professional staff,amsterdam to new york i flew hi fly on a norwegian flight an older jet the interior was outdated a bit the overhead reading lights could only be turned on from the crew one of the bathroom sinks wasnt working there were only about 6 movies and 2 tv shows to be entertained from but if you are flying 8 hours you should know to bring some sort of entertainment with you seats were cloth not leather if that matters the crew more than made up for any shortcomings i felt like they had a full crew of well trained and professional staff but they were pleasant smiled and made sure our drinks were taken care of since we also bought meals they were likely one of the best crews that i have ever flown with i fly about 30 times per year all in all sure it wasnt a boeing 787 but they got us where we were going
17879,shanghai airlines,5,shanghai airlines customer review,shanghai to nanning on july 4 delayed nearly 252hours sitting on the plane with hardly any airconditioning however the captain kept us periodically informed which was good flight was okay except the flight attendants did not smile checkin was ridiculous i had to open my checkedin baggage cause they suspected 1 my less than 50 ml bottles of skin care and 2 a small hotel sewing kit
696,air algerie,7,air algerie customer review,frankfurt to annaba this summer return the age of the plane from ffm to alger was pretty old the alger annaba flight the same on the return both planes were new there was no delay service on the ground and onboard is ok food was excellent even during ramadan take care at the airport especially on the way from the international to the domestic airport in alger dont give anybody your papers except if you are sure they are really officials
21869,virgin australia,6,staff very friendly and helpful,check in was easy staff were very friendly and helpful the only drink available was water which was no big deal given it was such a short flight snacks were available for purchase unfortunately the flight was delayed for 40 minutes
17893,shanghai airlines,4,shanghai airlines customer review,july 2012 shanghai to melbourne business class overall the flight was good but the attention to takeoff and landing procedures was appalling we had many people using ipads and other devises while takeoff and landing luggage on the floor that should have been in a locker again during takeoff there was absolutely no inflight entertainment and the seats were old and even though they reclined back the leg rest was uncomfortable we were offered drinks with a meal but no more the planes were old and very tired when i asked about an express customs card they had absolutely idea of what i was talking about as some of the staff really struggled with english
21133,tunisair,6,tunisair customer review,lhrtun return both legs were on 2 of the older a320s in the fleet which are showing their age the flight from lhr left 1 hour later than the std however this was due to the aircraft arriving late from tunis upon return the flight left 45 minutes late as there was no ramp staff in tunis to load the baggage and hence we had to wait for these to become available to load the baggagecargo before we could depart the food even by airline food quality is very poor however the seating in economy is very impressive both in width and pitch it must also be said that the cabin crew are extremely helpful and very polite
2910,air tahiti nui,5,positive aspect was the service,when booking my flight from los angeles to paris i was thinking about air france i came across air tahiti nui as a quick and cheap departure option on expedia i wasnt too sure about this airline when we got to los angeles international airport lax we stood in the checkin line the lady checking in our luggage was very nice and professional as she was checking our passports and wrapping the badges on our luggage she warned us about frequent delays on this particular flight as she anticipated we were delayed for about an hour or more this was imperative because we had a shuttle service in paris who had our initial arrival time and had to wait for us anyway we boarded the aircraft and noticed that our economy seats were very small and tight for an 11 hour flight these seats were terribly tiny and uncomfortable the inflight entertainment was very limited the movie selection was limited and there wasnt a variety of genres the positive aspect of this airline was the service the attendants aboard the flight were efficient responsive cooperative and professional i cant think of anything else to say about the staff the food onboard the flight was just like your generic airline food it was cold slimy and disgusting i recommend purchasing food and snacks prior your flight in the terminal overall staff was great but accommodations and passenger convenience werent well
16730,regional express,8,regional express customer review,coober pedy to adelaide nice experience check in at a little bungalow in the desert friendly ground staff unhealthy snacks like chips or something sweet but they also offered drinks seatback was not able to recline
17355,s7 siberia airlines,4,not allow my hand luggage,tyumen to moscow i bought a ticket from tyumen to johannesburg south africa but when i checked in at tyumen airport they would not allow my hand luggage they insisted it was not allowed although i bought the ticket through s7
1345,air canada rouge,4,premium rouge seats uncomfortable,have flown this route a few times in premium rouge firstly it has always been late on my most recent flight manchester to toronto no amenity kit in premium rouge ipads lent out but no headphones not a word from the pilots food basic on the return yyzman premium breakfast is a slice of banana bread with a drink same aircraft both ways and the ipads were grubby the seat trays dirty i find the premium rouge seats uncomfortable when compared with air canada premium economy also if you use the rouge ipads entertainment is only films no music games or moving map pretty poor experience having used the service a few times have decided i will no longer use rouge for any further flights
8554,el al israel airlines,2,better take another airline,you pay extra for baby seats you wont get it on board and then you have to contact customer service to get your money back for the extras you paid extra for using an airline that has baby seats but it is fake marketing better pay less and get better alternatives on board we were ignored and treated poorly even though we didnt complain or annoy the staff there is just negative energy from the staff we didnt receive our food i had to go specially to the attendant and ask why we cant get food and rudely answered but you got drinks better take another airline
9337,fiji airways,2,no customer service,port vila to suva via nadi last year great this year completely unreliable misleading and no customer service i was off loaded at the airport because the passengers that had checkedin before me had excess baggage and the plane was overweight they preferred to off load passengers rather than the excess baggage months later i tried going again and i got to my destination but then my return flight was cancelled i was booked onto the next flight 3 days later but missed my connecting international flight got stuck in suva for an extra 2 days and was then given the wrong rebooked return flight details in writing and missed my unknowingly booked flight and was then rebooked again on a nondirect flight no compensation for the additional accommodation expenses was offered when requested the customer service team then issued me a credit for my flight but when i tried to use the credit i was then told i didnt have a credit this was after days of correspondence confirming the contrary and only written correspondence because their customer service phone number didnt work my next trip has been cancelled consequently but not in sufficient time to have my accommodation bookings cancelled without charge all i got from fiji airways was a sorry there was a misunderstanding with no further offer of assistance or attempt to rectify the situation the manager of customer service was unavailable to make any further complaints to in flight the flight attendants are great but the food is a disgrace
4445,ana all nippon airways,9,seats offer a lot of privacy,ana has one of the best business class seats that offer a lot of privacy and comfort even for a tall european of 185m the seat is long enough to find a comfortable sleeping position flight attendants are outstandingly friendly and attentive without being obtrusive or robotic and from my experience they all speak very good english food quality was above average but although the flight from tokyo to sydney is 95 hours main meal service comes on one tray with appetizer and entree served at the same time which i find not really reasonable i found breakfast on this route rather bland and meagre but flight attendants are happy to find some addons eg a leftover cheese plate or so inflight entertainment is generally ok but falls behind singapore airlines or qatar in terms of choice of movies or music at least the europeanwestern selection they might have a better selection for japanese korean or chinese taste
10710,gulf air,7,1 hour flights with gulf air are always almost effortless,1 hour flights with gulf air are always almost effortless the service and food are decent ife is good to kill some time but nothing compared to other big regional airlines i like the new planes as they have big screens for economy and quite comfortable legroom
10932,hawaiian airlines,1,providing well below average service,thank you very much for providing me with a horrible service and ruining my honeymoon i used hawaiian airlines for interisland transfers and they were never on time always late i had a day trip to maui and they started loading cargos after all passengers had completed boarding thankfully it only took about 20 minutes or so on 072322 there was an issue on a plane and all passengers had to deplane and take another flight i planned a day trip to kauai departing honolulu at 7am and coming back at 6 pm however because of the delay now i have to cancel all booked activities the airplane is still not departing as of 72322 840 am one good thing about hawaiian airlines is they are very consistent they are very consistent in providing well below average service they dont let you down when providing poor services they are never sorry for anything i have another upcoming island excursion to the big island i hope not to get the same consistent service
19187,sriwijaya air,5,sriwijaya air customer review,tanjung pandan to jakarta in early july stewardess service is quite good food is just snacks but are tolerable flight was delayed almost an hour during the flight stewardesses were busy selling rather than serving passengers
13265,la compagnie,8,all business without flat beds,i flew to new york to work but didnt have the budget for a business class fare so decided to try the la compagnie the booking process was truly frustrating their website would not accept my contact details and than it would not accept my payment card i had to phone la compagnie twice they did answer the phone but the whole booking process took 45 minutes once my booking was made i was sent an email advising me to download an app for uptodate flight info this app did not work more time annoyingly wasted i tried to join their frequent flyer programme but was refused the online checkin facility didnt work so i phoned them again and was told that i would have to check in at the airport my first dread was getting to luton airport this was surprisingly easy there is a fast train 20 minutes every hour from st pancras the eventual destination of the train is nottingham i think so my point is that people book seats i was lucky to get a seat next time i will book there is less luggage storage space on the train that you would find on an airport shuttle like the heathrow express then you have to get onto a rather horrible shuttle bus to the terminal this bus seemed a whole lot more horrible following an overnight flight on the return journey once at the terminal i walked to the desk and was checked in within about 30 seconds a couple of words about luton airport there are more people smoking outside the terminal than there are checking in inside the company that operate currency exchange at luton ice offered a rate of usd 134 when the actual rate was 154 and than charged a whopping 3 commission on top luton airport is currently undergoing remodelling so there were lots of hoardings walkways and noise i went through security on the fast track really quick and didnt try the business lounge there was no sky bridge for boarding so we walked downstairs and crossed the tarmac with umbrellas i quite liked that as it reminded me of my childhood the plane is a boeing 757 and looks box fresh the blue grey colour scheme is soothing there are 78 seats in a 22 configuration the cabin crew are dressed in supersmart outfits and were welcoming without being overly solicitous on the return flight they remembered and greeted me nice touch the amenities bag is a stylish canvas job with caudalie products and all the usual stuff the ife is provided by a tablet that you can remove from the back of the seat no latest releases but every james bond movie ever made i imagine that you would soon tire of the selection if you flew regularly on this route food was good simple and fresh the seats most important thing the seats are angled and not flat beds so although one can stretch out getting truly comfortable enough to sleep properly is impossible for me i propped my feet up on pillows and then bolstered my body with yet more pillows but this assumes an unlimited pillow supply to be comfortable which would not be available if the flight were full why on earth did they not take the opportunity of launching a new all business airline with flat beds i want la compagnie to be successful and to keep fares low at a price that wasnt far above ba premium economy this is an absolutely brilliant way to travel however if fares start to climb la compagnie will not be able to compete on comfort service or convenience
17315,ryanair,8,found it was an ok airline,i found it was an ok airline with a good crew and ok airplanes the seatings are good enough for a 130hr trip and the food was in a reasonable price as same as you find in any caf in sweden for every item and the flight very smooth we even arrived 10 minutes earlier than expected when we came back to gothenburg the only remark is the hurry to get aboard and disabord the airplane due to the tight time table but its fine for me i would fly again with them
6624,cathay pacific airways,9,experience was very pleasant,the flight experience was very pleasant the online checkin process was simple the flight attendants are all polite hardworking and well mannered the food is pretty good it doesnt have a large selection but the quality is good the food is warm enough the dinner roll is warm and soft theres fresh fruit and ice cream too this is instrumental to a long flight 14 hours as you dont want to feel stuffed but refreshed and hydrated the flight is clean and seats feel very new not sure if they did any renovation during the pandemic the ground service of cx at the logan airport is great i need to take the second flight and basically had no ideas on what to do with my baggage the ground service there told me where to go where to claim my baggage and where to drop off and check in again one improvement i would make is on the movietv selection
20617,tigerair,6,tigerair customer review,that was the first time id flown with a lowcost airline and i felt a bit worried at first but everything ended up okay the flight was smooth and nearly punctual staff was a bit cold but i had no problem about that no food and beverages was served for free so better prepare your own overall i had a decent round trip sgnsin i will consider flying with them again if possible

19791,tame lnea area del ecuador,3,would avoid if you can,cuenca to quito second flight cancelled in the space of a week after checking in at the airport first one resulted in a 3 hour delay after rerouting from guyaquil to cuenca via quito this one is an 8 hour delay leaving us no choice but to remain in cuenca airport just an 8dollar lunch voucher offered as compensation staff were friendly but information given was haphazard seats on other flights have been old and ragged food very poor would avoid if you can find another carrier

19659,tam airlines,3,not let passengers use them,yesterday i flew with my one year old child from sao paolo to london normally bulkhead seats are allocated for parents travelling with young children disabled etc but with tam you have to fork out around 100gbp for this privilege one way all bulkhead seats were empty during the flight but the flight attendants would not let passengers use them they advised that an extra charge applies for those seats if we are going to use them the food and drinks were quite poor we were offered water only twice during 11 hour flight and breakfast was unedible

9266,fastjet,1,i had to book another flight,we were supposed to fly on the 16th march with fastjet only to receive few hours before my flight an email saying that my flight had changed to fn 154 the email that i got was not clear at all not stating which flight had changed no flight number or departure airport was mentioned so i assumed that the flight on the 16th march had changed i emailed the airline but had no response back so i had to book another flight from dar es salam to kilimanjaro which cost me the triple of what i had booked with fastjet i arrived at the airport and went to fastjet desk only to be told that this flight was on time and i was too late the flight was leaving in 35 min i showed them the email and they told me that flight change refers to the returning flight i dont understand how can you change a flight without mentioning the flight number or departure time my return flight changed from 2130 to 1230 needless to say that this flight change didnt suit me at all as i was on a safari and obviously couldnt make it i had to book another flight coming back with precision air as fastjet didnt offer any other flight times and again the cost was triple i expected a refund for this inconvenience as it was totally unfair what the airline did and the cost for the other flights that i had to rebook was ridiculous however none of this happened
22829,wow air,4,licence to be rude,baltimore to reykjavik wow has the worst customer service ever seen this goes across the board from ground agents to the flight attendants our flight crew was terrible from baltimore to reykjavik when we board the plane no one was greeting the passengers during the flight upsell stuff was the only goal of the crew they barely answered simple questions and when they answered they were plain rude in reykjavik during my return the ground crew were so rude i really could not believe it i understand the company rules and being a discounted airline but i cannot accept people being rude to a paying customer being discounted airline seems like gave these people licence to be rude take it or leave it is the attitude pay more fly respectfully

17861,shanghai airlines,6,it was a pleasant flight,shanghai to kota kinabalu shanghai airlines code shares with china eastern airline it was a new plane and the flight experience was good although one of the air steward seems like he hates his job but overall it was a pleasant experience the meals served was exactly the one i was served on my trip to shanghai nothing special something to fill an empty stomach the seats are comfortable whereby the headrest was tiltable we were given pillows and blankets on the flight but the flight was kinda warm even though we flew during the night coming from someone who cannot really stand on cold the flight was really warm overall it was a pleasant flight nothing special to praise or criticize about at least it got me safe back home

13986,lot polish airlines,3,a poor product for business,warsaw to baku such a poor product for business class this is a 4 hours flight and no hot meal at all was served just cold cuts basically even lufthansa does better than this selection of wine and beverages is very limited no champagne or prosecco of any kind but a rather cheap polish sparkling wine the service is not polished and not very friendly seat is stone hard no wifi on board and of course no ife or overhead screens the selection of movies streamed onboard is ridiculous in terms of quantity and quality no inflight map the positives the 7378 max used was very clean and quiet and the price was half compared to lufthansa never again
3749,airswift,7,crews and ground staff friendly,manila to el nido airswift is a philippine boutique airline offering daily roundtrip flights from manila to el nido and this is the only way to go to el nido if you book any property of the el nido resorts you would get a discount on its flight and there is also a vip lounge for guests of el nido resorts in the airport they fly at4 a very old plane do not expect to have much service in this short one hour ride of course also no any entertainment but the crews and ground staff are friendly

16990,royal brunei airlines,4,misleading and poor service,brunei to singapore misleading and poor service i purchased an economy ticket a week before my flight i received an email if i would like to purchase an upgrade hence after reviewing i made an offer with few hundred dollars couple of days later they accepted my offer and charged to my card my check in flight went smoothly and proceed to departure gate i was holding a business class boarding card so i went to the business class lounge at the departure hall after entering the lounge a receptionist looks very reluctant and i ask her if i can visit the lounge with my upgraded ticket without any hesitation she answer very rudely and say no so i ask her again if my frequent flyer silver can be used here she just said i have to pay so i have to walk away embarrassingly with other real business class pax behind me after security check i proceed to the aircraft i was given a window business class seat but i was surprising to find out this is not the kind of business class seat i paid for i was offered a larger and much comfort with longer leg room seat on my email with pic shown but they have not mentioned the business class seat picture was taken from a b787 aircraftthe sector flown was an a320 aircraft the business class seat was smaller when front pax seat reclined and its not a flat bed as advertised it took out much of my forward space and i have to consistently adjust my ife when the seat in front make any movements the service was not that expected on a business class level the crew did not address the name of the pax drink service only once offered special meal request not mentioned but to serve directly to me when meal served did not ask pax if drinks need to top up or offered overall not the type of the business class level service that i was expected imagine if i was paying a full business class fare this would have been not worth it

5952,breeze airways,6,good flight for the price,good flight for the price when i could actually get on the airplane reaching someone is impossible bdl jax before i even traveled i experiences problems with breeze airway the day before i was to depart my flight was cancelled in the middle of the night due to staff unavailability i had to reach out to breeze via the app to schedule another flight which was the next day my first days trip was totally wasted the next day the flight went without any problems airport staff at check in were helpful and polite jax bdl on my way back we arrived 2 hours early however breeze airway arbitrarily decided to depart nearly an hour early than scheduled i received no notification of this change i realized the breeze airway baggage check in were not available to check my bags so i had to rush through security and have someone put my bags under the plane right at the terminal im lucky they had enough basic communication to tell their staff my bag was a last minute addition under the plane but thanks to zero confirmation my bag was physically handled i worried my bag was going to be left in jax during the whole flight i got my bag though no problems overall the only reason im giving a 610 is the flight itself was adequate and affordable acceptable spacing and the flight got me where i needed to go safely however the sudden changes are a nightmare making me wonder if i should routinely risk the potential of my travel plans on breeze airways sudden whims i was not happy with the lack of available people at baggage check in as well as through online phone or even at the terminal until boarding started i had no phone number to call someone inperson so much of my plans were just leaps of faith i sent an email and days later i receive an automated message which directed me towards a different automated solution i need a physical person to talk to some problems cant be solved by yes or no answers advice 1 constantly check the status of your flight for sudden changes 2 arrive 3 hours early just incase breeze arbitrarily decides to change the departure time 3 arrive two hours before scheduled flight takeoff to ensure you get your baggage checked in if you miss check in youll know when no one is at the counter and its within 1 12 hours before your flight leaves just go directly to your terminal and have it checked under the plane right at the terminal hope they actually do it 4 your only way to contact someone reliably is either through email where youll have to wait or at baggage check inboarding because other than that you will notget ahold of anyone at breeze its like theyre a ghost a mirage 5 if youre using breeze for a business trip make sure your flight is at least 2 days before you need to be at your destination this is just in case breeze decides to cancel your flight last minute and youre forced to schedule the next day then hope that second flight actually takes off

10372,germanwings,8,friendly cabin staff,hannover to rome at the airport we had a very smooth transition to the gate took 20 minutes then we left everything was on time and actually arrived 20 minutes early inflight cabin staff served small sandwiches and water even though this was only a 2 hour flight the cabin staff came several times to give out beverages i enjoy germanwings clean cabin and low prices as a budget airline i was not expecting a lot but friendly cabin staff interacted with kids and gave a relaxed flight
18871,spicejet,6,overall experience was ok,spicejet is currently least preferred airline in india but as getting a good deal in last moment and schedule suits me go went with them overall experience was ok certainly not bad flight departed on time and reached before time as its a lcc so no meal included and nothing much expected the aircraft used was on wet lease from corendon airlines so even flight crew was from corendon as they didnt know hindi so that was a language problem with few passengers seat confirmation was same as boeing 737 operated by spice jet legroom was just ok for small route
18644,south african airways,7,crew did the minimum possible,washington to accra in business class south african airways uses tk lounge in dulles which was jam packed with line ups for the washrooms boarding smooth with early departure from iad i was initially in 2a but moved to 9k in the second business class cabin when i saw some kids a couple rows behind me big mistake because there was a young woman two rows behind me who wanted everyone to know that she was there and travelling in business class she fussed over everything talked loudly from her seat to a passenger behind her flirted shamelessly with the male cabin crew and in the middle of the flight when everyone else was asleep talked a full volume in the galley i had to get and tell the crew to tell her to shut the hell up to no avail then on final approach to acc she was sound asleep and couldnt be woken up she was a complete idiot at one point she stood in the second galley and pointed to the first larger business class cabin and announced that must be business class but where i am the smaller second business class cabin must be first class because it is small a complete idiot shame on the crew for letting her talk so loudly in the galley in the middle of the night service was ok but definitely no way near the standard of many airlines the business cabin was just over half full but the crew did the minimum possible when i inquired as to how the seat is made up for sleeping one fa just pointed at the two packages of blanketspadded cover and said there they are as if i hadnt already seen them no effort at all to help prepare my seat for sleeping during the meal service when it was time for dessert i was asked what i wanted i said id have the cheesecake and the cheese plate then was told that it was company policy that i could have one or the other really in business class with a nearly halfempty cabin food was mediocre overall i liked the bulkhead seat in the second cabin row 9 because the foot area is double size unlike a lot of the new coffinlike business seats where you feel like you are undergoing the worlds longest mri
17698,scoot,1,never see us onboard again,i reviewed this previously and this post is to verify my previous claim and comments but also to post the response from scoot customer service or lack thereof at no time did we seek a refund from scoot what we sought was that they come to the party with a nights accommodation for the enforced layover in singapore they never responded to any emails until we had returned to australia and then waited several days before doing so i have included the text of their email for readers benefit dear a thank you for writing to us we refer to your refund request for scoot booking received through our online feedback form we are truly sorry for any inconvenience caused to the change in flight schedule that may have disrupted your travel plan we understand the impact on our passengers when there are changes in our flight schedule however we want to reassure you that we will only make changes if necessary as schedules are subject to changes scoot will make every effort to get our passengers to their destination within a reasonable time from their original schedule we regret that we are unable to offer any options we seek your understanding on this occasion if our service level did not meet your expectation thank you for your continued support and we look forward to seeing you onboard yours sincerely scoot shall never enjoy our continued support and they will never see us onboard again
9453,finnair,3,food for long haul is extremely disappointing,i flew a350 from singapore to helsinki with finnair the aircraft is new and spacious for economy but food for long haul is extremely disappointing drinks after the first one you must pay for in a long haul flight is unheard of from a national flag airline breakfast is another huge disappointment no snacks service is kept to minimum entertainment is out of date program for a national flag airline it is the worst i have seen even worse than ba economy class i would never fly finnair again unless there is a gun pointed towards me rather choose other national flag and they are all a similar price

15640,openskies,3,no difference with economy service,paris orly to new york jfki reviewed this airline in business class some time ago indicating that the biz bed which pretends to be a british airways club world first generation bed i doubt it is by far the worst in the industry with absolutely no way to sleep the premium economy seats have one advantage they are the original seats of the lavion airline an all business class light airline which flew years ago between paris and new york and provided excellent service british airways bought it and made it openskies a 3class extremely mediocre product the now premium economy seats are still good for pe but they are old tattered and with many functions not working anymore the planes are ancient mainline british airways boeing 757s 25 years it cannot be much less where the interiors are not maintained at all to find other airplanes in such horrible condition one has to go to africa and use the least reputable airlines one can only hope it is likely that the airframes are in better condition than the interiors even the blankets very old ba club blankets are dirty and smell the ipads provided for ife are extremely dirty and their covers are in rags as to the premium economy service there is apart from the seats absolutely no difference with the economy service at the back of the plane or with the most threadbare ba economy service the food is plain inedible even worse than on ba world traveller services to low revenue markets bring your sandwiches the fas are pleasant and they mean well but there is not much they can do in such sad conditions

8616,el al israel airlines,8,did not like the entertainment,amsterdam to tel aviv we were at the airport 3 hours early but security took only a few minutes maybe because we are 71 year old americans very polite and friendly hosts did not like the entertainment which was stripped down for a brand new plane overhead movie or use your device decent legroom food was the pits seats comfortable took 2 flights both of which left late but arrived early did not like how little luggage we could bring
8128,dragonair,7,dragonair customer review,dragonair really is an ok airline i flew them for the umpteenth time to kaohsiung and while the unentertained seat was bearable well it was pretty comfortable the flight was really boring as the seatbelt sign stayed on service was good and breakfast was phenomenal aside from crunchy siu mai on the return i wonder if studioka trades off good food as the food we had was starchy not too bad but not good studioka is limited without actual movies overall pleasant but nothing worth raving about
4658,asiana airlines,4,korean air fared far better,during the flight a huge majority of the passengers as well as most if all not of the cabin crew were koreans except from the announcements turbulence arriving message etc played over the pa system all other announcements asking if anyone wanted extra servings of beverages or had rubbish for throwing etc relayed by the flight attendants facetoface were done in the korean language only no efforts were made by the cabin crew to engage nonkorean speaking passengers as they seemed to have forgotten that there were passengers of other nationalities on board in this aspect korean air fared far better
6950,china eastern airlines,4,dreadful service,auckland to paris via shanghai airplanes are relatively new but the maintenance on board is low broken usb charging plugs broken remote control for the entertainment system broken headphones jack broken lock in the lavatory etc it is worse especially due to the fact chinese airlines do not allow you to use powerbanks onboard means you cant use your phone as an alternative for long another part is the service china eastern provides very basic service not to say rough it is all very technical without any understanding of what service means dont expect a smile or nice gesture you wont get it one lovely thing is the free wifi access on the flight but it is so restricted to western site that you can forget about google facebook voip most messaging apps yahoo search etc eventually when i arrived at my destination ive noticed major damage to my suitcase ive reported the damage filled up a form send several emails etc 3 months passed and i havent got any compensation yet china eastern doesnt answer online they dont respond on facebook on their website or to emails they are practically not there dreadful service
10693,gulf air,8,cabin crew were attentive,pleasant flight although it was an older aircraft and the trip was a little bit bumpy takeoff was on time with no issues at all food was nothing special but it was okay for breakfast cabin crew were attentive
2683,air nostrum,5,air nostrum customer review,basel via barcelona to granada the flights between basel and barcelona were operated by air nostrum although sadly since theyve stopped flying to basel i think their service is nothing short of amazing first of all on the return we were even given a hot meal this was in economy class and the flight is less than two hours generally the quality of the food is good and the service in economy class is more like what you get in business class on most airlines the flight attendants were very friendly which only made the contrast to the surly unfriendly bunch working for iberia seem even more unfriendly
11293,iberia express,5,seat given to someone else,gran canaria to heathrow my prebooked exit row seat was given to someone else on a full flight i was allocated another seat where the legroom was woefully tight i cant remember feeling so uncomfortable especially as i was 18 euros poorer for having prebooked 14a and being allocated 23a i was asked by a young couple to give up my window seat so i had an aisle seat which wasnt much better as the movement of people up and down to the toilets encroached upon my comfort on the plus side the flight was ahead of schedule and the cabin crew were again most charming and efficient i would willingly have paid a bit extra if they had taken a few rows of seats out but would only fly this airline again if my seat requests at extra cost had been honoured
6056,british airways,2,shame for such well known airline,i flew from cairo to heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat horrible service i get to heathrow airport 40 minutes late so i had to run around looking for my connecting flight finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate given a seat that is different than what i paid extra for its a shame for such well known airline
4560,arkefly,7,arkefly customer review,i flew from orlando to amsterdam in premium comfort class the flight was actually pretty good it was on time convenient priced right service was good and the food not too bad if you compare it to the major long haul carriers ie delta lufthansa virgin etc you will find some areas that do not compareie the seats only recline they do not lie flat no power for computers older planes and basic service is offered not over the top like some carriers i would recommend this carrier as a low cost alternative to the big airline companies
21850,virgin australia,7,pleasantly surprised by the virgin product,having flown with qantas many times previously i was pleasantly surprised by the virgin product if any thing comparing to my last qantas experience the virgin was a better product checking in while busy was okay the lounge is comfortable and comparable to the qantas club lounge boarding was prioritized and you received a beverage prior to take off the seat was comfortable and larger than the economy seat the service was very good with a hot meal and multiple beverages offered the cabin crew were friendly and diligent on landing my bags came out with priority something qantas has been unable to do for a while
14397,malawian airlines,2,my seat was filthy uncleaned,johannesburg to lilongwe was originally booked on sa170 but due to their strike i was rebooked onto malawian airlines et21 the whole process was a total mess boarding gate staff pulled aside 5 or 6 passengers because they did not scan passports at the checkin counters made us wait until the entire flight was boarded and then scanned us and boarded us after that i was seated in 1c business class my seat was filthy uncleaned and plastic parts of the seat were broken and cracked the tray table for food was broken and sat at an angle with the food tray sitting on the edges delicately and precariously hostess did not seem bothered about this and still place food and drink on the wobbly table which was frightening food was abundant it was very tasty and enjoyable could not fault it aircraft information card was fool of dried food obviously not cleaned for ages will never want to be on this aircraft again if i had a choice
11961,jeju air,2,one of the worst airline,cebu to incheon by far one of the worst airline weve experienced i traveled with my wife from cebu to incheon we were delayed from cebu to incheon they accepted our 1 piece checkin baggage that is around 19kg and we have 30kg allowance combined however they did not accept the same checkin baggage from incheon to cebu they strictly said that one piece checkin should only weigh 15kg or less they are not organized and they dont have customer service at all i even speak to the manager in charge for jeju air in incheon airport and they didnt seem to know how to provide customer service they can only offer you a free water for a 4 hour flight i have tried jinair before which is also a budget friendly airline but they are far better than this airline stay away from jeju air if you have the chance
20516,tianjin airlines,8,cabin crew patient and polite,i flew business class sydney to tianjin seat is 222 layout only 3 rows which is a lot less busy than many airlines j class seat comfort good no privacy screens flat bed you never bump your legs to the side board pajamas is provided and amenity is clarins food i will give 35 due to a lack of speciality entertainment is 35 due to a lack of choice the cabin crew decent patient and polite lounge at sydney is skyteam lounge
19556,tway air,6,made me feel discriminated against,it is the first time i flew with this airline the aircraft was fine and for a low cost airline the legroom for someone tall like me was fine especially for a 430 hours long journey two things really disappeared me firstly as opposed to other low cost airlines tway does not allow you to purchase luggage excess if its less than 24 hours before the flight that is a real con compared to other low cost airlines which allow you to purchase luggage up to 3 hours before the flight so for 11kg of luggage i had to pay 84 because i couldnt purchase it online the night before the flight secondly the on board service made me feel discriminated against i wanted to buy some food and beverages but i could not because i did not have a korean credit card or korean won i could not believe it i had foreign universally accepted credit cards and a korean current account card but they were not acceptable to them it had to be korean credit card or korean money how ridiculous is that please remember this was an international flight flying from vietnam to korea they wouldnt accept vietnamese dong either i complained about it and i have to say the staff were understanding about but were unable to help me i actually asked them it this an international flight or is it just for koreans i truly felt discriminated against and pointed out to them that a foreigner travelling with this airline to korea stand a very good chance of not having korean money or a korean credit card that means that you cannot buy anything on that flight only the koreans travelling with them needless to say i will try and avoid them if i can in the future i live in korea and unfortunately this reinforces my existing belief that korea is still very korean and for koreans and nowhere near as international and inclusive as other countries in asia
10108,frontier airlines,1,the worst flying experience,by far the worst flying experience of my 45 years the first flight from o hare was canceled after multiple delays and they finally agreed to reroute me through a city 200 miles from there since i was expected at my destination i took it 2nd leg had a slight delay also but i got there 24 hours after expected 2 flight back had 2 legs as well 1st leg again delayed no mention of 2nd leg was made by staff but the layover time was enough that i made it or so i thought the flight from atlanta which was supposed to be at 1027 pm was announced as delayed to 1120 pm ok i thought no biggie at 10 pm they announced it was delayed to 2 am because they didnt have staff heres the kicker if they found staff they would leave earlier so passengers couldnt move from the gate no meal vouchers for this 4 hour delay clock kept ticking 1230 am i went to get some coffee came back the board at the gate says departure at 1225 am all passengers were still waiting but i panicked and asked the agent and he says sorry mistake its at 2 am then all gate agents left 1 am 130 am 2 am 100plus passengers are at the gate desk calling out for someone to come and update us i started talking to their online agent no customer service telephone line it takes 15 minutes to get one online he closed the chat unexpectedly ok lets say it was an accident but given their behavior this far you get the point i try again it takes 10 minutes the agent says all their systems are down and she cant tell me whats happening with my reservation i tell her im asking for flight status surely you have that or air traffic control would have something to say she keeps repeating all systems are down and she cannot tell me more i ask for a supervisor she wont get me one 315 am someone shows up at the gate desk and says theyre just waiting for pilot passengers are really panicking by now and asking why we arent being kept informed the 2 agents who came out smirk at the crowd and say they dont have to let any of us fly they say the pilots have to wait out the time before they can fly again and ask all of us to move to a different gate okay passengers agree and we walk 327 am i get a text saying flight is at 330 am then gate agents leave again from the new gate they come back around 4 and say flight canceled we can go to ticketing counter to get refund or reschedule oh you also have to get your checked in luggage if you know atlanta airport i get my luggage and go to the ticketing counter all the way at the terminal entrance huge lines they say next flight to anywhere in illinois will be in 2 to 3 days at that point i ask how much will i be refunded because another ticket booked with another airline for just that short leg would cost 3 times as much answer is i dont know if i choose to stay at the expense of 2 lost vacation days will i have hotel covered yes but meal and hotel wont happen until 3 pm remember this is now 5 am for a 1027 pm flight and all passengers have been awake through the night because of their stupid conditions eventually i book tickets on united and decide to eat the loss

19160,sriwijaya air,3,terrible customer service,surabaya to jakarta i have not flown with this airline before check in experience was smooth and fast at t1 juanda airport however things got bad quickly as the flight was delayed by 15 minutes and two flights were in one departure gate making it very crowded people were sitting on the floor which was horrible when the time arrived the ground crew shouted over and over again telling people to hurry what terrible customer service the food was only one tiny horrible bread and mineral water the plane was dirty the seat pockets were filthy as well as the floor baggage claim was delayed because of the slow ground crew for me this middle service airline is worse than citilink which claims to be a budget airline
4569,arkefly,6,arkefly customer review,amsterdam to cancun via holguincuba very cheap upgrade from economy class to comfort class worn out seats but offering extra legroom and moveable headrests crew very friendly on the downside only radio channels are free no video entertainment on main screens but you could rent a dvdplayer for 12 euro extra total rip off also only one meal with drinks after takeoff is for free after that everything except water has to be paid for arkefly is a good company but this payforeverything extra like low cost model is not working on long haul flights
2021,air kbz,7,professional and pleasant,we recently took 4 internal flights on airkbz during our holiday in myanmar they use mainly atr72 500600 aircraft for these flights they serve a snack and a drink on flights longer than 1 hour on shorter flights boiled sweets are served the planes were newish and in reasonable condition at every check in you are given a sticker to identify your destination once onboard these stickers are seen on the backs of every seat and safety cards fas were professional and pleasant the schedules were punctual as the turnaround time on hopping flights is well under 20 minutes some of the flights left before time as soon as all the passengers were on board
15078,nok air,5,id fly nok again,bangkok to krabi nok is a true budget airline a little gritty rough around the edges and youre never really comfortable in terms of believing that youll get where youre going on time i checked in online and bypassed the ticket counter but past experiences have been less than easy if you dont prepay your bags online you have to check in via one line go to a bag drop and another line then go to a payment counter to pay the baggage fee its a pretty terrible system but this timenone of that straight to the gate dont expect much in terms of announcements watch for the crowd and go queue up when its time their flights seem to require a bus out to the plane and thats your typical budget airline experiencethey try to get all 150 of you into one to avoid making two trips the aircraft on my trip was old and a god bit worn out nok chose to paint their planes in a really colorful scheme i call it sky chicken fabulous with a bird head on the nose of the plane unfortunately the colors havent held up well so the appearance of the plane is shabby and faded even from the outside the crew is quick and a small bottle of water is included a nice touch the english skills of the crew are marginal for an airline that carries a lot of tourists but if youe heard the safety presentation before elsewhere theres not much that the crew has to talk to you about they advertise wifi on board but no nok flight ive ever flown delivered on that promise my flight left late and arrived late but no announcements or apologies were made it appeared to be just part of a normal nok day air asia is still the cream of the crop in thai budget carriers with vietjet delivering mostly good results as well nok joins the second tier with lion air nok does offer a frequent flyer program which sets them apart but it requires you to write them and send a copy of your boarding pass to get credit which is honestly just too much hassle to get a free 25 flight id fly nok again but theres nothing that would steer me toward them either

4389,ana all nippon airways,5,could not upgrade my seat to premium economy,i was looking forward to this flight as it would be my first time flying with ana and heard great things about the airline i chose and paid a little extra for seat 30a which turned out to be a mistake the seat does not recline and is up against the bulkhead the seat is also more narrow due to the builtin tray most uncomfortable seat for a long flight disappointed that i could not upgrade my seat from economy to premium economy crew was attentive and courteous there were two meals served on this flight which were average at best

1115,air busan,8,great value budget airline,osaka to busan great value budget airline web site and onboard magazine promise free water but none was offered checkin at kix was about 20 minutes checkin at pus was zero with no other customers in sight offered decent seats even though we hadnt prebooked them outward flight was delayed due to air traffic control restrictions at kix but landed on time due to timetable padding return flight left early but landed slightly late after circling around western japan for ages boarding on both flights smooth bus to terminal at pus but sky bridge on return flight perfectly adequate and reasonably efficient for a budget airline and a onehour flight would use again
22041,vistara,9,expect an outstanding onboard experience,goa to bombay in business class we have come to expect an outstanding onboard experience on vistara and this time it was no different my one point of criticism was the transport from the aircraft to the terminal upon landing in bombay the bus was packed to the gills in complete disregard for the current pandemic situation we are in what is the use of masks and face shields if you are going to have people brushing against you and breathing down your neck
3875,alaska airlines,2,lousy customer service,i flew from san diego to newark on 10142022 i am handicapped lousy customer service all around flight delay which can happen from time main cabin seats hardly any leg room once the airplane landed it took an hour to get the plane to park and instead of being in terminal a we wound up in terminal b no wi fi

17029,royal brunei airlines,7,not a premium service,london to brunei via dubai with royal brunei airlines cabin half empty row 11 has no windows adjacent to seat which requires passengers sitting in 11a and 11k to lean forward to see outside the window despite half empty cabin one of the three main menu options were not available as airline is a dry carrier only basic fruit juices fizzy drinks and hot beverages are served cabin crew polite and efficient but not a premium service complimentary goody bag is a joke when compared to most other carriers crew change in dubai and next sector to bandar seri begawan only had four pax in the cabin both service and food on offer much better on this sector seat and flat bed comfortable ife choices are limited and seat configuration 2x2x2 is not ideal for long sectors toilets clean the product difference between royal brunei and a premium carrier such as qatar airways is substantial paying the additional premium in order to get a much superior product and service delivery may well be justified
21568,uzbekistan airways,5,dont expect much,new york to tashkent uzbekistan airways offers direct flights from jfk the fleet has some relatively new boeing 787 but dont expect much beyond knowing youll get there relatively quickly theres no online checkin on the website so arrive at least 3 hours early for international flights and expect to queue food is ok coming from nyc very mediocre coming from tashkent lots of screaming kids running laps in the aisles so bring earplugs or music entertainment system has lots of russianuzbek movies but the worst dubbing ive ever encountered rather than removing the russian soundtrack they simply put the english translation over it so that both play simultaneously the english translation is just that one guy reading all the male character parts with a russian accent and a woman doing all the female parts
23046,xl airways france,5,xl airways france customer review,this was the least expensive flight i saw advertised and was not as bad as some reviews had made me fear the legroom is scarce for a taller person i am 5 foot 9 and it seemed that this flight was slightly longer than it actually was the food was average but given the price i cannot say i wont fly this airline again
21963,vistara,4,extra for premium is not really worth it,the seats in the premium economy are in 333 arrangements compared to the 323 in the older version of the aircraft the seat space is similar to the economy with a little more leg space paying extra for the premium is not really worth it sometimes the premium economy seats are cheaper only go for it when this option is available no wifi onboard on this aircraft tv sets cant be tilted if the person sitting in front of you reclines hisher seat you can switch off your screen and plan something else to do its the first time to see the newer version of the aircraft is worse than the older one they were using
5491,batik air,8,batik is very good value,jakarta to jayapura comfortable flight with decent food and a good selection of movies the only minor problem was that headsets were not provided and had to be purchased from crew for 25000 rp with the fare very similar to nofrills lion air part of the same group batik is very good value
22940,xiamen airlines,1,better than delta or united,los angeles to manila via qingdao most impressed better than any delta or united flight ive ever used i was fed many times and received respectful treatment i was particularly impressed by xiamen airport the view from the taxi port was as stunning as a ranked wonder of the world lax was particularly unremarkable for an international airport it was just pathetic maybe 40 years ago laxs art deco design was charming but it just looks like a roadside tourist trap now doesnt even have usable wifi or updated drinking fountains
18779,southwest airlines,5,probably just go back to united,normally fly with united airlines but decide to try southwest airlines since military fare discount when you call so far united is better when it comes to boarding for military first military boards after a group on southwest airlines i will probably just go back to united airlines unless united airlines doesnt do military fare discount
14719,meridiana,9,meridiana customer review,having had a great outbound flight and reviewed it as such i was a bit apprehensive about our return flight from florence to gatwick nothing to worry about as it was also fine left on time arrived at gatwick a few minutes early efficient check in at florence airport and friendly service on board only comment is that we had paid for extra legroom seats by the emergency exit and mine was by the window and it is a different design from the others in the row and was uncomfortable fortunately we were able to move to other seats in the same row across the aisle so i would suggest you avoid a window seat by emergency exit maybe we were just very lucky
5931,breeze airways,8,everything went smoothly,i had no delays or cancelations everything went smoothly and the staff was friendly i worried that id have a bad experience based on other reviews so i wanted to be sure to include a positive one on here

14372,mahan air,9,consider to fly this airline again,tehran to copenhagen excellent value for money traveling alone with a baby can be challenging but i found check in and boarding procedures smooth and without delays the flight attendants were young and very nice to us a340 with smart and clean cabin food and nonalcoholic beverages was plentiful as a hot breakfast was served at the beginning of flight and a cold refreshment before landing in copenhagen this was a 5 hour flight and i did not expect that inflight entertainment could be improved this was a great flight and i would consider to fly with this airline again in the future
8177,druk air,6,druk air customer review,druk air the flag carrier and only carrier to bhutans only commercial airport paro is up to snuff the 141 jets are dualconfigured and it is worth flying c class as i did from delhi via kathmandu and again from paro to calcutta if only to have better maneuvering for the quite incredible flightseeing of the himalayas the fas are friendly professional the food service is adequate if bland reflecting the cooking of bhutan perhaps the check in facilities are excellent and paros terminal building is quite pretty almost folksy in a way i look forward to flying druk again the name means dragon in bhutanese for otherwise why would anyone choose such an unappealing sounding word at least to an english speakers ear druk does not cooperate in ticketing with iata carriers and ticket costs are somewhat stiff i doubt if the king of bhutan will permit competition anytime soon
17818,sereneair,6,hope this new airline succeeds,islamabad to karachi 1130pm flight fully bookedhad an aisle seat near the back pilot started to reverse from stand while passengers were still standing meal was served a dinner which was not too bad and service was efficient aircraft was not new but clean seats ok but not much leg room arrived on time hope this new airline succeeds
8971,etihad airways,1,cabin crew are so rude,i will never be flying with this airline again and i encourage anyone to stay away from them the cabin crew are so rude on all four of our flights i certainly do not recommend flying with them with a young baby the treatment we got was disgusting not only were the cabin rude and not helpful at all hardly anything worked on the flight out tv was broken and half the toilets which was great for a 14 hr flight should be ashamed of yourselves and the way your cabin crew behave pressed the buzzer so many times and nobody even came

21301,uganda airlines,3,one of the worst days of my life,i checked in for my flight electronically for my flight on wednesday nov 30th i arrived 3 hours early at entebbe airport i was told the flight was not checking in passengers yet so i waited in the waiting room my flight appeared on the screen of flights but two hours passed and it still said on time instead of check in at this point i get worried and went through check in any way in case there was a problem with the screen and it never changed i went into the airport and could not find anyone from uganda airlines to check my baggage i asked and some employees say i had to wait i waited for 30 minutes until i get scared something is wrong and i was going to miss the flight i was told to leave the airport and go to the ua office to ask what was happening once i got there the employee told me my flight was moved to friday dec 2nd i did not receive any notification with this information i was allowed to check in on wednesday the screen in the airport had the flight there and it said on time i had nowhere to go i was not offered accommodation for those two nights i had no cash on me it was a terrible experience i spent 6 hours at the airport wasting my time 3 waiting for the flight and another 3 trying to figure out what to do i was crying in the airport and booked somewhere to stay until wednesday having to spend a significant amount on accommodations and food for those days i remember a lot of months ago when i was choosing between this airline and another and i picked this one because it was cheaper in the end it ended up being more expensive and one of the worst days of my life
5289,bamboo airways,3,they moved the flight to an a320,booked travel on the 787 and in the end they moved the flight to an a320 a very old one service of the cabin crew was ok food wise wouldnt pay that much for business if i knew they were going to serve me that if i was not mistaken it was 2 choices chicken rice or the beef udon total rubbish seat was cramped on business too

18581,smartwings,6,definitely great value,dubai to prague with smartwings although the flight was booked via czech airlines the carrier was smartwings a czech low cost carrier that said i was pleasantly surprised or maybe had very little expectations the flight departed from t2 at dubai airport so it took a little longer to get to check in the check in agent could not add my czech airlines frequent flyer number but after checking with his supervisor he was told that skyteams miles are eligible the service was delayed without any announcement however the pilot promised to make up the lost time enroute tight seats but the food and service by the cabin crew was fine the flight attendents seem to have favourites on board offering them pillows and blankets whilst others were being asked to serve themselves the blankets from the overhead lockers there were not enough pillows or blankets even though this was an overnight flight overall an ok service and for the price paid definitely great value
9076,eurowings,4,puts profits before customer service,this is an indifferent airline with a flawed business model that prioritizes and puts profits before customer service and satisfaction case in point delay outbound from frankfurt and inbound to frankfurt by 3 hours the traveler can secure a specific seat for a fee but gets a different seat assignment at checkin is that legal i guess if you collect money upfront prior to rendering services you can pull these stunts meals provided are barely edible bring your own sandwich for longhaul flights the cabin staff is friendly the seats are not designed for todays traveler unless you are 150cm a weigh 50kg inflight selection is very limited and same on return longhaul flights there is room for improvement but no incentive to do so if you run into problems the government is not far away from providing a bailout funds
14424,malaysia airlines,5,zero sense of urgency,well maintained aircraft with a crew desperate in need of basic service training totally dont understand how business travelers are about efficiency messed up my coat return and zero sense of urgency its a cultural issue
20328,thomas cook airlines,6,aircraft used is unsuitable,manchester to hurghada the aircraft used for this 5hr flight is in my opinion unsuitable the seats dont recline and are quiet hard no entertainment system or charging ports and its not like the lack of amenities are hugely reflected in the ticket price but the flight crew were very friendly and professional so not all bad
727,air arabia,3,very terrible experience,i have had a very terrible experience with my luggage my luggage was left in sharjah when i got to entebbe airport i was told i would get it the next day and 5 days later nothing yet its my first experience using this flight and im not sure i will use it again unfortunately i have already booked a return flight with them but after my return flight not sure i want to ever use air arabia again i am so disappointed then the flight set off almost an hour late from almaty

3558,airbaltic,4,fee for a checked baggage,stpetersburg to brussels via riga at the departure of the airport of stpetersburg i had to pay for a supplementary fee for a checked baggage instead of a carryon baggage even if it was one of the correct size as i did not want to miss my flight the officer did not hear any of my argument and forced me to pay the 60 fee instead of the 16 fee for an overweight luggage without any regard for my consent as this kind of behavior is qualified as a scam i am truly offended by this event i strongly do no recommend this company which does not respect the eu consumers rights i hope you will avoid it as much as it is possible
14059,lot polish airlines,5,very unprofessional employees,the staff during my trip was nice and helpful i fly by myself with my 8 month old baby but the connected flight i went through the hell airport in warsaw the worst airport ever the employees are so rude and very unprofessional they speak only polish and who cares that they work in airport we needed to run like crazy to catch connected flight no one helped me to take the stroller to the planed i needed to go through the stair with baby and the stroller they also do another check in and the gentleman spins only polish language and it took us so much time to pass control because he could barely talk horrible airport horrible transfer very unprofessional employees rude staff in the airport
22164,vivaaerobs,1,this is the worst airline,this is the worst airline they will cancel your flight with zero notice because their flights are not full and then they make an excuse that the airport you are flying to is closed or immigration will be closed when you get there they will not refund your money under any circumstance and will say the flight was cancelled and it was your fault that you did not board the plane

18547,smartwings,4,not the best experience,palma de mallorca to prague not the best experience i had noticed there was an anomaly on the original eticket regarding the 23kg baggage i had paid eur60 for in respect of both the outward journey to palma and the return the original eticket stated that there were 0 pieces for the return from palma i emailed smartwings the day before the outward journey explaining the situation and i had a response within three hours confirming 1 pc of luggage for the return from palma and a new receipt nevertheless at checkin in palma i was informed i could not check in the case because the record stated there were no pieces of luggage with the ticket fortunately after an anxious few minutes i was able to produce a printed copy of the final and amended receipted i had received on request before the outward journey and this was accepted checkin was opened relatively late leaving little time at the departure gate despite the 40minute delay i travel with smartwings and csa regularly rarely on time and there are never apologies for delays expensive especially for a budget airline on the positive side plenty of legroom no food but at least water offered i used to rate sa highly but they seemed to have suffered from the takeover
12758,kenya airways,8,will fly them again,kigali nairobi entebbe return 2627 march 2023 aircraft were narrowbodies the first flight was on a b737 while the three remaining flights were on e190s all four shorthaul flights were on time this was a mileage run to retain my flying blue gold status as it otherwise was going to expire by end of the month i was at first travel attempt denied boarding and my ticket was suspended by a junior staff in kigali they said upon liaising with immigration i airport that my reason to travel was not valid i tried to change purpose but the damage was done which forced me to postpone the entire trip however later i had the ticket reissued by kq town office in kigali who were professional and committed to help without any payments as it was not a no show case they even took over the booking from my travel agent which was effective and great relief avoiding potential additional costs i even got a much better and more expensive itinerary avoiding nightflights though extending my transit lounge stays while the junior kq staff in airport should be sacked for denying me boarding the kq staff at town office should be praised and rewarded for constructive and expedite provision of resolutions and quick ticket reissue by ignoring and avoiding the ota the rescheduled trip went fine in all aspects lounge access accommodated prior to all 4 flights and the lounges are all of good and solid quality slept fine in pride lounge in nairobi where i spent an eve and a night effective boardingsdeboardings by either bus on foot or by jetbridge onboard welcome champagne available on all four flights i had prebooked seat 1a which was given me throughout i preordered my favorite seafood meals which were delivered and tasty the sole exception was a morning flight where they could not manage my seafood despite it appeared in their flight manuscript not a big issue but they apologised kq always manage special meals effectively this is really a perk that not even legacy carriers like qatar airways or klm allows for the crews on all flights were fine professional caring and in good mood the food is getting better on these regional flights and i had my tasty hot minimeals served throughout hot towels provided nut mix were provided as snacks provided to assist on drinks which were served several times the challenge of my trip was the seemingly unusual turnaround in ebb to which airport staff were confused as i instantly returned to my origin without going landside they allowed me not to buy a transit visa and escorted me to transfer security and thereafter negotiated excessive spending time in lounge for me i was granted full access for 7 hours though the airline agreement was only 3 hours onboard no ife and no wifi which is fine for short flights no luggagebaggage issues flying blue status respected and some skypriority entitlements were given eg priority boarding recommended will fly them again would have given 1010 but have to deduct a bit for denied boarding initially by the junior incompetent staff member in kigali airport

21991,vistara,9,i would definitely recommend it,i would definitely recommend it the staff are very polite and speak excellent hindi and english some innovative ways to introduce safety announcements before the flight the food is delicious and authentic there is plenty of entertainment from both hollywood and bollywood as well the only thing i would improve is that for tall people like myself there isnt a lot of leg room otherwise everything is excellent

10318,georgian airways,4,seats that dont exist,yerevan to tblisi first at the yerevan airport checkin counter for georgia airways flight to tblisi at 1540 there were two counters one of the counter system broke down leaving only one counter operational we were behind the queue with the non functional system and had to join the other one we waited 50 mins then the counter lady issued us a ticket with seats no 14a and 14c as we boarded the plane we found that there were no seats 14a and 14c the rows ended at 13 it almost became a joke as ive never boarded a plane that issued tickets with seats that dont exist luckily there were some spare seats at 13
14751,mihin lanka,5,glad the flight was only 1 hour,i usually fly budget so dont expect too much had my first flight with mihin lanka from chennai to colombo plane was not new but im glad the flight was only 1 hour as the seats felt like they had lost all their padding the flight went smoothly except the stewards did not offer any option to purchase refreshments it may seem unnecessary on a short flight except by the time you have got to the airport and followed all procedures a few hours have ticked over and some refreshments would come in handy probably what concerned me most was the fellow passenger pouring a hot drink from his flask to his wife how did that get through security there was someone on his mobile phone as we were landing the other fellow who grabbed his luggage and made his way to the front door before the plane had stopped
9434,finnair,4,no vegetarian dinner options,terrible experience probably second worst of my 30yrs of flying 45 passengers in business class had only 2 functioning toilets on a 8hrs 30min flight website didnt show meal selection and on board there were no vegetarian dinner options entertainment system is old and the touch screen ui was very irritating lounge at helsinki was crowded
69,adria airways,5,adria airways customer review,i fly adria quite a lot aprox 2 flts a month my routes are normally vielju or zrhlju i always wondered why adria is not high profile airline being small can be a plus the crj200 and 1000 are ok specially 1000 which are brand new and also a319 latest delivery i hate that they never board on time neither depart on time for 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min but they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off the service is worse every time now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water the flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless i miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert the price is well overpriced for what they offer there were old inflight magazines in cabin crew is good but sometimes too familiar with passengers or fellow colleagues
15074,nok air,7,pleasant uneventful flight,udon thani to bangkok pleasant uneventful flight friendly crew clean aircraft arrived early quick luggage delivery at don mueang airport checkin in udon male agent could not be bothered opening his mouth to say for instance hello or something as simple as that entire checkin process was done in complete silence at 645am maybe he was still tired
7810,csa czech airlines,5,delays and unassigned seats,copenhagen to prague this is actually the worst airline i have traveled delays unassigned seats nobody gives you more information and the crew does not know what to do when flight is overbooked this was the only time i flight with them will never book on that airline again the aircraft was old
11074,hong kong airlines,9,great service on board,another really good travel experience with this young airline of hong kong web promotion got me very cheap business class tickets from hong kong to taipei with perks such as lounge access a generous luggage allowance great service on board fully flat bed nice food and all that arrived in taipei in terminal 2 around 7 pm the terminal is quiet passed through immigration with no waiting needed luggage quickly delivered i was out in less than 30 min return trip was as nice eva airways handled the check in and offered lounge access at their the club star alliance lounge everything else was the same in many ways they exceeded what the other major hong kong based airlines in terms of service and attitude hong kong airlines made flying in business class a possibility with such incredible prices if they are doing promotions and offer great prices have no worries and give them a try
21408,up by el al,4,crew were friendly and proactive with customer service,the flight from kiev to tel aviv was delayed by about an hour and a half you can print your boarding pass at a selfserve counter in kiev which is nice if you dont have access to a printer the queue for check in is long because of the extra security the security personnel were very friendly and professional the aircraft was clean i got a salad which was tasty and inexpensive legroom is very tight my knees were touching the seat in front of me the crew were friendly and proactive with customer service but lacking when it came to safety and controlling passengers during the safety check they ignored a man talking on his phone as we taxied on landing in tlv many people started running down the aisle and opening the lockers while we were still braking on the runway the crew didnt say anything for a few minutes which only encouraged it even when they did make an announcement it was ignored and they took no further action i would avoid flying them again particularly on this route where fares are cheap anyway on the way to kiev i flew with aegean for only a slighter higher fare and they were excellent
3464,airasia x,2,200 charge for bags,tokyo to denpasar bali the worst flight weve ever had we are on our honeymoon and had to pay the equivalent of 100 for each bag two 8kg backpacking bags when we sat on the plane we were not together the plane was almost empty we asked to switch and they hesitated and then told us a specific area we could sit in why wouldnt the check in counter seat us together we had prebooked our seats but that didnt matter no water or tea service is served free we bought one small meal and couldnt afford anything else the toilet was out of soap and paper towel honestly all of that would have been fine if it wasnt for the 200 charge for bags and not being able to get free water
21493,us airways,5,us airways customer review,on my way back to canada i chose to fly us airways since i made a last minute booking and didnt feel like paying a full y class fare on air canada i usually fly air canada and star alliance partners so i chose us airways based on them being a former partner i was surprised comparing the flight to canadian airlines such as air canada and westjet the seats were not at all what i would have expected there was no ife system on a319 or crj but that was expected on the crj cabin crew was very nice and pleasent there was a complimentary beverage service and a la carte snacks however i found 4 us for a small pack of pringles and 7us for a tiny bottle of heineken a little steep seeing as this was a domestic flight i would understand the lack of ife there werent any onboard power outlets on any aircraft my laptop died halfway through my flight to philly safety briefing was done by the flight crew but it seemed that they were tired of doing it not many were paying attention and i believe a safety video would be more effective for the value of what i paid for id say it was very much worth it
17197,rwandair,7,good seat sizes and leg room,gatwick to dar es salaam via kigali plane has a good cabin configuration with good seat sizes and leg room in economy configuration at the rear of aircraft allows a large number of 2 seat allowing easymore access boarding at lgw was quick and easy cabin staff are efficient and happilyarrange passengers with infants and mobility to be in better seatsnear bathrooms meals were very good surprisingly as the presentation was not great it was a very bland looking tray when it arrived but the food was very tasty basic in my case salad chick curry and a chocolate sponge on arrival at kigali i was informed of a 6 hour delay to my connecting flight to dar es salaam these are the moments that test airlines how do they deal with this in the same breath and informing me of the delay i was informed we have a shuttle bus waiting downstairs to take you to a local 4 star hotel escorted to immigration front of que a 10 second stamp of passport to be whisked to the hotel in 25 minutes to have a welcome juicewater room keys and the wifi code the room was a suite toiletries and a note of what time lunch will be and pick up time back to the airport refreshed and fed back 6 hours later to have an uneventful connection to dar es salaam once again a bland looking lunch served on the plane but again it was very tasty full of flavours kigali airport small but works efficiently the most armed police i ever seen inside and surrounding an airport but everything moves at a steady pace despite the numerous rigorous security checks
21105,tunisair,5,4 hours of delay,tunis to rome with tunisair first they said that the flight was ontime boarding was expected at 1410 the flight was supposed to leave at 1440 so i wait at the gate 10 minutes pass 20 minutes pass 30 minutes pass i decide to go to the gate agent and said oh yeah the flight is delayed to 1600 its 1530 and the plane was not here the plane finally arrived at 1615 and we boarded at 1645 we enter the plane and when boarding wad over we waited 1 hour in the plane the crew said nothing and when we finally pushed back instead of takingoff we just waited by the runway we finally took off at 1840 my flight was at 1440 so 4 hours of delay for a 1 hour flight there were ptvs and it was nice the food was good we finally landed at 2000
15144,nordavia,7,nordavia customer review,arkhangelskarh to tromsoetos with a stop in murmanskmmk fast and easy checkin and boarding decently comfortable and rapid security check aircraft antonov 24 has seen better days but was ok for a short flight cabin crew polite and professional got served drinks on the first leg to murmansk then snacks selection of meats with bread and piclkes on the way from murmansk to tromsoe departure and arrival according to the timetable luggage arrived ok overall experience fine apart from the high price
5857,bmi regional,3,customer service is not good,regularly use bmi regional to travel between bristol and munich for work price for flight is usually exceptionally high when compared to other airlines unless you can get a ticket in one of their sales flights often delayed or cancelled with little notice flight schedules changed after booking with up to 3 months delay in airline notifying of the schedule change customer service is not good only able to provide generic half hearted apologies or request you put it in writing which takes several weeks to get a response and is usually just a generic thanks for your feedback with no real answer to questions on board magazine and website states that food selection on board is a bistro box however this is rarely the case some flights you are lucky to get a small packet of crisps on the plus side cabin crew are friendly and helpful seats are relatively roomy for a small aircraft and bristol airport is more convenient than some of the larger airports
13724,liat,2,one of the most poorly run airlines,grenada to port of spain liat is one of the most poorly run airlines ive encountered our flight was delayed in grenada but still showed as on time on the display board at the airport even though it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure times we were given no explanation or estimate as to when the flight might depart in fact there were no airline employees anywhere to be seen at the gate it would have been nice if they would have had someone come offer to help expedite checking in for connecting flights in port of spain the airport closes the checkin counters quite far in advance of flight times and getting through immigration and customs is slow our flight ended up leaving about an hour late the aircraft crew were the only professional part of the experience upon arrival in port of spain the hour delay made it impossible to check in for my connecting flight even though i found a customs agent willing to help expedite me through a rather lengthy line i met a fellow passenger in the same situation as me and we realized we had basically just been left stranded in a foreign airport with no idea how to resolve our situation there were no liat agents at the ticket counter to consult with about rebooking the flight or booking accommodations a local trinidian resident noticed we were seemed lost and offered to help but didnt know what to do a random baggage handler not affiliated with liat noticed that myself and the other passenger seemed a bit lost and distressed and offered to call and see if a liat agent was available one finally showed up at the counter but then refused to provide any compensation or explanation for the delay he just played with his mobile phone and gave a half smile whenever i tred to interact with him he told several other passengers he would leave a note for the connecting airlines representative who also was not available and we should have seats on the same flight 24 hours later no confirmation of the booking hotel vouchers or food vouchers were provided i rebooked the flight myself to ensure that i would have a seat the next day the lack of customer service from the ground operation of liat both in grenada and port of spain was appalling i will be rebooking my return flight through another carrier even if i have to eat the cost of the liat ticket
23139,zipair,2,the worst airline i have been on,the worst airline i have been on the main problem are the checkin procedures in seoul which were pathetic the staff would not let us put in 1 x 23 kg bag even though we paid for 2 x 14kg bags apparently it breaks the rules even though we technically paid 30 more doing it this way they also made us take out 3kg and put in our hand luggage because of some random policy they then make you wait for 510 minutes while they check your bag for some unknown reason none of it makes sense and is totally out of line with every other airline process globally avoid at all costs
1262,air canada rouge,2,left us stranded,cancelled our flight two days before a hurricane was anywhere nearby citing bad weather meanwhile air transat and other liners continued to fly passengers out on the exact same route for the next few days no issues whatsoever air canada left us stranded and to fend for ourselves offering absolutely nothing but an apology email to further aggravate our desperate situation our local ac representative asked us to wait an additional day for more information from him before securing a spot in a hotel for an extended stay unbelievably the essential information that we were waiting for was that were out of luck and that it was not his problem as you can imagine by the tone of this review we are still trapped in the dominican riding out a hurricane that has only just begun to touchdown hoping and praying to fly out in two days unless they cancel that flight as well the credit card can only take so many extended bookings
3280,airasia india,5,need to learn a lot,delhi to chennai not on time departure senior crew member doesnt know how to respect the passenger went on to an argument with the crew for money exchange i was not handled properly didnt get a message either for the delay i had to rush and come later found the flight was delayed staffs in airport were awesome corporate meal info was not mentioned on the ticket need to learn a lot from indigo
6525,cathay dragon,7,seats are comfortable,hong kong to zhengzhou this is the first time for me to travel with cathay dragon overall i think that this flight to zhengzhou is satisfying and it basically meets with the quality that the cathay group provides the cabin staff are nice and the seats are comfortable as for the food and beverage i think they are satisfactory not too bad but not too tasty the hagendazs ice cream is probably the food that i appreciated the most the only thing that i want to criticize is that no inflight entertainment is installed on the a320 fleet of cathay dragon passengers need to download the ka studio app in order to enjoy their inflight entertainment however even though i have downloaded the app in prior it still requires me to download patches after getting on the plane and i could not figure out how to use it therefore the only thing i could do with the app is looking at the flight map which is quite disappointing for such a worldclass airline
6224,buddha air,1,disgusting and unprofessional,biratnagar to kathmandu i waited for 5 hours just to be notified that my flight was cancelled i arrived airport at 1600 to catch my 1725 hrs flight we kept on asking if our flight was ready they told us our flight was being held but surely we would fly at 1800 hrs but it was around 2100 hrs after boarding they told us our flight was cancelled as the pilot told his time was up disgusting and unprofessional
2918,air tahiti nui,1,service cold and lacklustre,los angeles to papeete with air tahiti nui travelers beware reservation agents rude and unwilling to process cancellation within 24 hours of booking and website does not allow online cancellation plane was very old the seat arm rest tray table and tv monitor buttons are worn or torn onboard service was cold and lackluster this airline certainly cannot compete with worldclass airlines fly air france to tahiti if you are looking for superior experience
20089,thai airways,9,i had a great flight with them,reading some average reviews recently wasnt too sure about thai airways but i had a great flight with them check in was fast and efficient as was boarding on board the thai product is still great the cabin crew so friendly and service was attentive meal was delicious and enough entertainment for this short 2hr hop only down side was the baggage delay in bkk
5799,blue1,9,blue1 customer review,lhrhellhr on md90 good friendly service each way flight out i was expecting to pay for food but had free breakfast teacoffee ham roll and some chocolates free top ups of tea and water offered later in the flight seats with good pitch and comfortable on way back had to pay for food but expected
22822,wow air,2,do not use this airline,newark to dublin via reykjavik they hook you with cheap fare average size carry on luggage 70usd each way no free meals no screens but they will charge you for use of a tablet no free tea or coffee 325 per cup if you think that purchasing a ticket will save you money you are wrong everybody complained about the cost of a bag 150 round trip never before have i traveled with people who were openly critical of the airline before take off seats were not comfortable we ate nothing drank nothing watched nothing listened to nothing no internet be prepared to pay far more than expected do not use this airline
7684,croatia airlines,4,check in was rude unhelpful,the croatia airlines staff during check in was rude unhelpful and refused without explanation to print out the boarding passes for each part of the flight forcing us to run around trying to get boarding passes before boarding actually starts overall experience with staff at the check in left me under impression that im unavoidable annoyance to the lady who was checking me in very unpleasant experience flight itself was average typical boring flight
21971,vistara,1,i am extremely impressed by their work,we boarded at trivandrum airport flight attendants were extremely helpful they helped us consolidate our weight and also helped us fly without any bags both of them helped with my husband to get him a wheelchair and also kept on asking if he needs a doctor as my husband was not feeling well i am extremely impressed by their work and very thankful to both of them and others who kept helping throughout our flight i will definitely fly again with vistara and also recommend to others
7403,condor airlines,1,claustrophobic business cabin,claustrophobic business cabin with one bathroom seats become beds only apparently for someone 5 feet 11 perhaps awful limited options food no business lounge in lax no internet on board limited movie collection a serious ripoff think before clicking
18428,sky express airlines,7,i would recommend,athens to paros we were a little worried catching this flight after reading the reviews we had a little issue with our carry on mini suitcase being too big and we ended up paying 45eu extra i do warn you square carry on bags will not fit in the over head lockers so best to organise them to get checked in before you reach the counter other than that the bags arrived at the destination with no issues and the flight it self was on time and we didnt have any issues boarding or during the flight i would recommend
7351,condor airlines,7,what a pleasant surprise,what a pleasant surprise my first time on condor but it wont be my last smooth check in orderly boarding great crew with a very positive attitude and food way above the standard of legacy carriers on the route look forward to flying them long haul
11347,icelandair,4,there was only food for purchase,after a delay due to weather i missed my air canada connection to kef i chose to be put on the icelandair flight 24 hrs later boarding was confusing for a 6 hr flight there was only food for purchase where air canada provided both a meal and snack the beverage cart came around once with water offer several times later in the flight the seat was small uncomfortable and the movie selection very limited customs in kef took forever as several flights landed at the same time the good part i got to kef on time
14932,nam air,7,enjoyed my flight,i chose this airline for the simple reason of its aircraft type boarding was completed quickly for on time departure on board seat pitch was a little tight snack service box was offered water and a sweet coffee bun and a sales trolley after that cabin was quite warm and no walk though by cabin crew offering water cabin is showing it age for sure but still enjoyed my flight
6669,cathay pacific airways,6,really disappointed with the overall experience,brisbane to london heathrow via hong kong with cathay pacific airways considering the premium seats cost almost 4 times the economy seats i was really disappointed with the overall experience meal was exactly the same as what you receive in economy as is the amenity kit when compared to pe in qantas or ba this lacks a lot you get meals and drink service more in line with business class on those carriers the only advantage if you are a oneworld emerald or sapphire is getting access to the pier lounge at hong kong airport otherwise if you dont have status and are looking for an upgrade other than just some extra leg room then i wouldnt recommend this wifi also didnt work on all 4 return legs of my flight despite there being a wifi symbol on the walls you would be better off spending your money on china southern airlines business class seat for a similar cost and get a lie flat seat or paying for economy on one leg business on the other with any airline tip also avoid the front row aisle seats in premium i dont really have long legs 5ft6 and yet the air hostesses still knocked my feet every time they came through the door from business waking me up at least 4 times despite my legs not sticking out on the aisle
700,air algerie,9,air algerie customer review,tunalg in the new 737800ng business class a very good trip no delay good meat champagne before take off on time at algiers clean cabin a very large seat and big space not like air france or alitalia in business class

7258,cityjet,4,cityjet customer review,flew from brive to london city and had 35 hr delay due to technical fault annoying but these things happen what annoyed me most was the first time anyone tried to apologise was once we finally landed in london got a free drink though worth 3
12271,jetblue airways,7,they were not eager to assist at all,i am a senior and kindly asked the flight attendants to help me lift my bag to place overhead they were not eager to assist at all one of them said he had shoulder surgery and the other one did not lift it for me he just helped me to place it overhead if they are so sickly and unable to lift a small suitcase maybe that is not the right job for them it is the one and only complaint that i have
21563,uzbekistan airways,4,a horrible experience,london to amritsar via tashkent it was a horrible experience with uzbekistan airways the in flight attendants were inexperienced they burned my arm and leg in departure and arrival flights with hot coffee the staff even didnt knew how to serve coffee in flight then the worse part was that they didnt even offer first aid the food quality inflight entertainment broken seats is not worth mentioning
15946,philippine airlines,6,fare cheap compared to others,not very impressed and find it hard to understand how this airline has a four star rating seats were quite good but service lacking lounge in manila small and not adequate on the plus side flights on time and plane quite new fare cheap compared to others
8580,el al israel airlines,8,all in all a good flight,we got to the airport early so check in was quick i am not a huge fan of el al as have had bad experiences but this time the staff were friendly and helpful all went smoothly the entertainment was good with a fair selection the meal served was good for economy plane food they dont advertise that hot drinks and soft drinks and snacks are served in the back kitchen i only know this from recent flights with them the seats on el al are always cramped we were given blankets all in all a good flight no one was rude all the staff helpful
3164,airasia,3,scalp you for every dollar,at every turn airasia try to scalp you for every dollar examples such as hoping you forget to checkin online so they can charge you additionally purposefully allocating seat locations if purchasing more than one ticket in different positions onboard so that youre more likely to pay the 600thb per person to change seats and waiting to tell you last minute your meal option has been discontinued so you have to pay more to get a different meal we expect more as consumers and preying on the technologically vulnerable is shameful behaviour
22478,volotea,1,worst company i have flown with,worst company i have flown with just avoid it at any cost its a lot better to pay more for another company once they cancelled a flight a week before our journey to santorini greece september 2021 and they didnt refund anything just like that and the mails said that we will give you refund etc and nothing ever happened but we said okay it was just bad luck or a coincidence and also there were no other flights the days we wanted so it was a dead end now we have booked priority in order to have our carry on with us we saw the tickets and they told us we cannot have our carry on with us we show them that it says here we are allowed to have 10kg bag per person and everything that is written in the ticket and they just answered us that these are general information but they say for my journey the times the airplane door etc everything we show them the confirmation mail that says we have priority etc and they told us in our system it doesnt say so and we just paid again for what we had already paid
17938,shenzhen airlines,2,it was delayed for hours,bangkok to shenzhen 40 blankets for 120 seats get it together its not that difficult to manufacture some blankets hair on the seats and dirty windows on my way to thailand from shenzhen it was delayed for hours and everyone expected that its a sad thing when your airline is known and expected to be awful

20518,tianjin airlines,9,fly tianjin airlines again,it was the cheapest way to go back after yet another season in asia and honestly i didnt expect too much but the plane was quite new and the cabin was in a good condition departed on time unlike the connecting domestic flight by another airline before there was an inflight entertainment system available and it seems to be modern but after a night spent in two different airports i hardly used it for anything other than the 3d map although the food was served not as elegantly as some airlines do it was quite delicious and i could choose what i preferred on both meals despite sitting not in the middle of the cabin note that there are only soft drinks available but for me it doesnt really matter the seats are not exactly emirateslike but still quite comfortable for an 85 hours flight the headphones were usual cheap earbuds unfortunately but they also included an adapter which i took away and which will let me plug in my own headphones on some later flight great and i just dont understand why airlines besides those smart few who provide multiuse washablecup large headphones couldnt distribute just that on request rather than generating tons of cheap headphones waste the flight was smooth and arrived 15 minutes early definitely would fly tianjin airlines again if the price is right and the route will fit my plans and will stop at chongqing or tianjin where i havent been yet as well should i have time for that
18077,silkair,9,all around great,i flew from phnom penh to singapore on silkair and it was all around great the staff were friendly one positive thing about is its seats they feel soft and amazing legroom and the food was very tasty i had a tomato pasta with fish and it tasted very decent also the flight entertainment was enjoyable the flight was very smooth and relaxing i would recommend it

6949,china eastern airlines,4,not that good,wuhan to taiyuan the experience was not that good it is a midnight red eye flight however the cabin is so noisy and none of cabin crew come out to maintain the order the snack means just a pack of peanuts

20925,transavia,5,lack of communication,my 2 friends and i flew first with klm from berlin to amsterdam and then with transavia from amsterdam to marrakesh and back vice versa both trips with transavia werent 100 enjoyable due to the following reasons 1 lack of communication on luggage before flying there was no communication that there are differences in the hand luggage policy between klm 1 pieces accessory and transavia 1 piece yes the additional hand luggage has been checked in by transavia for free but an information beforehand would have been appreciated in order to consider packing in the first place reason provided by staff at airport were a low budget airline fair point still created misunderstanding and negative experience 2 lack of little pleasantries no free snack or beverage on a 35hrs flight 3 lack of visibilitytransparency on flight details no possibility to check flight information online on website reason provided by customer service booking includes flights from 2 airlines klm transavia 4 lack of communication at airport in marrakesh at 6am information screen stated that checkin counter is open staff appeared at 645am staff at airport only said that weve to wait its okay to wait but then dont say that the checkin is open in general i have understanding for a lot of things but id just appreciate more communication and visibility on possible differences to other airlines upfront

1490,air dolomiti,6,cabin looked clean and crisp,in favour of the staff onboard the attitude was extremely friendly we got a biscuit together with some water and the cabin looked clean and crisp what one can get on low cost airlines doesnt justify flying with many european full service airlines and that includes air dolomiti the reason i took them was only the time schedule certainly not for flying premium as the experience was nothing else than the opposite
21867,virgin australia,8,attendants were very friendly,i enjoyed the flight check in was easy and the flight actually departed early flight attendants were very friendly and efficient and the aircraft was very clean
6951,china eastern airlines,8,above my expectations,rome to seoul via shanghai i traveled with this company that i was a little skeptical of but i must say that not only was it far above my expectations but it earned my esteem romeshanghai and back with a new a350900 comfortable seats clean plane and with assistants present and kind classic food of the economy class while actually somewhat disappointing onboard entertainment considering that it was a flight departing from italy was expected titles at least in the italian language but where i must congratulate the company is the way they managed the typhoon emergency in shanghai i had to take a flight to seoul and was canceled with the closure of the airport but the company not only provided escort to the hotel with a shuttle bus but also food and accommodation for two days although the information was lacking it all happened suddenly have within 45 hours settled thousands of people in the hotel with their transfers that was really impressive

14653,meridiana,8,staff were pleasant and efficient,roma to olbia i hesitated about flying to olbia the ferry being another option given the poor reviews for meridiana the only company that operates a direct flight from rome to olbia in the end i decided to take the plunge on the basis that perhaps people with good experiences rarely bother to give feedback and i am glad i did the online booking was straightforward as was the webcheckin bagdrop etc ground staff and cabin staff were pleasant and efficient the plane boarded and left on time and we arrived ontime maybe even a few minutes earlier
11917,jazeera airways,3,block access to duty free,kuwait to dubai i have always used jazeera and was satisfied except when they introduced this new terminal and block the access to duty free it feels like you are in temporary jail and forbidden from all other services such as lounge etc i will never use jazeera again unless they allow access between terminals this too bad
1358,air caraibes,8,service onboard was very good,air caraibes direct flight from paris orly to pointepitre lounge access in orly but not a great selection of food the lounge was calm and not too crowded good service on board with a 222 configuration as i was travelling on my own i opted for one of the aisle seats in the middle that way i had direct access to the aisle and nobody will need to step over me to get to the aisle the food served was good and the cabin spacious the return flight was delayed but it didnt worry me too much as i had no connecting flight to catch however the lounge in pointepitre was quite basic with not much to eat nevertheless the ambiance was calm and relaxing service onboard was again very good and the food delicious

16506,qantaslink,8,qantaslink customer review,alice springs to cairns in a b717 great crew and a tasty hot meal was served usual good qantaslink service
20042,thai airways,9,friendliness and hard work of the cabin crew,this was a packed flight with a merry group of beer drinking passengers in my section there was not a single seat left the flight was punctual but what i wish to comment on was the friendliness and hard work of the cabin crew who never stopped working throughout the 10 hours of the flight i went for regular walks and coffee pick me ups and they were always polite and helpful also to the many passengers who required attention i enjoyed the meals and having travelled with other european carriers i can say that these crews are really on top of the game in economy we obviously do not enjoy the perks of higher classes of seats however the personal service was of the same high standard
7206,cityjet,6,a lot of technical delays,cityjet is a no nonsense airline with an ageing fleet their avro rj85s are really showing their age now with a lot of technical delays recently my flight wx197 was delayed for almost two hours 02dec on a multitude of reasons initially the scheduled plane had a technical faultthey flew a spare part in from dublin but then the mechanics did not make it on time and a cityjet night stopper was rescheduled this plane then had to be evacuated on a security issue and was no longer available for taking the flight back to amsterdam cityjet took some effort and flew a spare plane from dublin which first had to be completely catered and cleaned once we were ready to go after 1hr 55 on the ground the flight was a normal and eventless flight of 42 minutes these avros are really showing their age not just in reliability but also the cabin and other interior

8835,ethiopian airlines,3,pretty terrible for business class,staff are always nice on ethiopian and definitely the best part of the experience otherwise pretty terrible for business class the seats were old and dirty the entertainment system with limited selection food served to me was almost uniformly bad new business class lounge in addis airport is overcrowded hot and dirty the food is also pretty unappetizing and at breakfast they had no working coffee machine i fly this airline when i have no other choice

12250,jetblue airways,1,worst customer service,the worst customer service i have experienced i lost my flight since employees were too busy doing a shift hand over i was put in a flight for the next day which was longer and on top of that delayed worst airline to fly
18135,silver airways,1,worst airline i have ever been on,this was the worst airline i have ever been on our flight was supposed to leave at 330 and we left around 930 it wasnt weather based it was just them be slow and terrible then we were boarding and we had to wait even more their reasoning they forgot to clean the plane it blows my mind you can run something this poor and still have a business
9368,fiji airways,4,seats were rock hard,melbourne to nadi with fiji airways my first time to fiji and my first flight with fiji airways although it wont be my last visit to fiji i think i may consider other options for flights to get there i wouldnt say they were terrible but there were a few things that have affected my decision firstly the flights to nadi from melbourne only depart late evening and arrive early morning in nadi so its often hard to find accommodation or hotels that will accept such an early arrival secondly the 737800 is woefully too small of an aircraft to be flying such a route thirdly the food was very ordinary to say the least a choice of vegetarian or chicken on noodles which was a miniscule piece of chicken on average noodles i didnt eat on the return flight as i knew what was coming and couldnt stomach it the inflight service was ok on the way there one male fa was a little passive aggressive but they were friendly and smiling on the return flight seats were rock hard i had back pain and could not get comfortable on the return flight i think i might take the option of virgin next time i visit fiji unless fiji airways improve their service in the future
8051,dniproavia,8,dniproavia customer review,kbpotp sandwiches and drinks served even a local wine although the flight is just over 1 hour departurelanding on time check in chaotic in kiev embraer 145 looked in good condition but seats are pretty cramped if you have mediumlarge size handbag they will ask to load it in the plane as the overhead compartments are small they will give you back to you in the tarmac so no need to wait at the luggage belt crew was young but not that smiley good experience overall
15653,openskies,2,openskies customer review,ba flight 8005 from orly to jfk 9152014 planes are old and shabby and not enough restrooms seat was broken and did not recline at all cabin crew unapologetic and said it happens all the time unacceptable disorganized at orly checkin and security british airways needs to get their act together with this product i do not recommend
5110,azerbaijan airlines,8,pleasant service throughout,azerbaijan airlines ran a very smooth service from london to baku checkin was straightforward and they arranged for me to have an emergency exit seat with superb legroom the staff were very friendly and provided pleasant service throughout not disturbing me on an overnight flight the drinks offering lacked good wine sadly but this did not detract from the overall experience the kosher meal i had was virtually a banquet and the quality was excellent we landed ahead of schedule and had a very smooth visa registration process in baku i was pleasantly impressed by the service and would gladly travel with azal again
8217,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,flew aberdeen to teeside on several occasions service was good but no more than you would expect i have flown to orlando for less than they charge for a return flight to aberdeen i work with people who get return flights from aberdeen to manchester for 13 of the cost that eastern charge from aberdeen to teesside how do they get away with this
19417,surinam airways,7,surinam airways customer review,miapbmbel this was my first time flying surinam airways and i can tell i was very surprised with the service service on time ageing but well kept 737s crew friendly they hire a fa fluent in portuguese to help brazilian passengers on the flight to bel the food and drink rounds frequent seats are comfy and there is good recline my sole complaint will be about ground staff they can be grumpy and surly at times would fly them again
10208,garuda indonesia,3,lack of a lounge in yogyakarta,high disappointment for the lack of a lounge in yogyakarta for business class passengers i had to wait several hours in the boarding area they provide a voucher to be spent only in one of the worst coffee shop that is there who also claimed that the voucher does not allow to receive change
2637,air north yukons airline,9,wonderful friendly airline,vancouver to whitehorse air north is a wonderful friendly airline serving the yukon their combination of an older fleet and genuine hospitality makes it the ideal way to get to canadas beautiful yukon there is no ife on board any of their aircraft which can be a downside for longer trips but the food is all free and comes is greater quantity then the meal options you pay for on mainline carriers air norths flights are finished with a warm cookie service which is always enjoyable overall a great airline and great customer service
20596,tigerair,5,get what you paid for,dhaka to manila via singapore and with tigerair you get what you paid for the best thing it is cheap for those travelling on a tight budget you will get the minimum in order to get to your destination i had 4 flights no delays what i didnt like i cant complain because its a budget airline was the food quality i wouldnt buy any hot meals again from tigerair the quality is not good again youll get the minimum in order to get to your destination you will not even have a blanket even if its freezing in the cabin
6286,bulgaria air,9,bulgaria air customer review,i fly bulgaria air frequently due to the fact that they are without competition on many routes from sofia i do not agree with many of the utterly negative opinions about bulgaria air for the 50 something flights i have had with them in the last year there were no major delays i last flew on the internal flight varsofvar the aircraft was one of their new embraers however it did surprisingly look worn out boarding started with a delay of twenty minutes yet we landed on time in varna the crew was as per the general rule in bulgaria air surly it seemed that the best i could get from them was ignorance service was adequate a chocolate bar and a soft drink the flight was completely booked so it was amazing how three flight attendants distributed drinks and snacks to 100 people within twenty minutes the seat comfort was quite ok and i am really not a small man the best part of the flight was the captain who gave a very entertaining announcement during the flight all in all a very decent airline not the best but not the worst i would recommend them again
367,aeroflot russian airlines,8,very good service,lisbon to moscow i was excited to try aeroflot but had read some concerning reviews this flight proved that aeroflot offers very good service we could choose from three options for breakfast and trust me it was delicious the aircraft was just fine and the seats comfortable the staff are nice but could chill and smile just a little more or maybe it is my approach to service also if i check in online having to wait on a long queue at the airport just to drop off doesnt make much sense nowadays the same goes for not having the boarding pass on the wallet but having to have it printed
5478,batik air,7,it was a good experience,kupang to jakarta the checkin and boarding process was smooth and fast the crew were kind and helpful for in flight entertainment the ife was responsive although limited choice of new movie the food was okay the flight departed and arrived ahead of schedule which was good overall it was a good experience
4434,ana all nippon airways,3,the flight is cancelled,yangon to tokyo there was a storm in the south china sea youd think that when the flight is cancelled theyd at least shoot an email to the customers they did nothing we went to the airport and was informed that the flight is cancelled to be fair they did pay decent compensations for hotel and transportation
9189,eva air,1,have not issued me a refund yet,on 03222020 eva air cancelled my flight from bangkok to seattle via taipei for 30th march on 03272020 i submitted the refund request form on their website and they have not issued me a refund yet i have tried calling every phone number i can find for them however they just ring and ring and ring some of the numbers have automated messages saying they have a high volume of calls right now and then hang up on you
17047,royal brunei airlines,9,royal brunei airlines customer review,flew with royal brunei from melbourne to london in julyaugust found the staff to be excellent very friendly and they go out of their way to ensure a comfortable flight the price was excellent and the quality and service is defintely worth more then the fare paid the aircrafts are brand new 787s they are spacious and have excellent legroom im 67 and was able to stretch out my legs under the seat in front of me with ease the best legroom out of any of the major international airlines flying to europe food was great good hearty meals and a decent portion size hot meals served on all 3 flights lots of snacks and drinks offered during the flight it is a dry airline but being a part cultural thing not having that glass of wine with my meal wasnt a huge deal you can bring your own alcohol on board but noone seemed to take advantage of this in flight entertainment is good not the best variety when compared to other majors but a good selection of movies and tv shows to get you through the flight there and back i didnt notice a huge change in the movies from july to august apart from a couple new additions but this certainly wasnt a big issue if you want more movies bring your own laptop two stop overs on the journey to london a 3 hour stop in brunei which is not too bad airport has been renovated and it very comfortable apart from having poor wifi and the refuel stop in dubai is a very quick 45 min stop so a good way to stretch your legs ready for the next leg will fly them again
3393,airasia philippines,4,staff were crass and unrefined,cebu to manila with airasia the positive thing is that they are very affordable especially when you book a week before and all the flights have become quite pricey the downside is that more often than not you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service as i was boarding back to manila the gate staff were extremely rude and unpleasant they tore my boarding pass carelessly without a bit of finesse when i passed they abruptly went after me and rudely said that they had to weigh my bag they weighed it and it exceeded 1 kilo more than the allotted 7kg i brought the same things i did when i came to cebu last week so i was surprised but they demanded i pay luckily i have someone with me whos carrying less than 4 kg worth so they got my excess 1kg but the staff were extremely angry and unpleasant it made my flight tense and uncomfortable the plane was half empty by the way staff were so crass and unrefined for the hospitality business i understand that for a lowfare airline we get what we pay for but i dont think it should come with cheap staff and cheaper service truthfully airasia is a big help to a lot of people and travellers but would it hurt to treat them with respect
7740,csa czech airlines,5,flight attendants were not very friendly,flight no ok723 departure 825pm late departure aircraft turboprob not the youngest but ok the flight attendants were not very friendly like they would be happy to have end of work after this flight i pressed the service button wanted to ask if there is regular cabin service and nothing happened they switched on the full light when preparing fb service but forgot to switch off afterwards when collecting the waste they ignored me several times all in all okay scarce
13248,la compagnie,5,my flight was cancelled,newark to paris i booked the flight back in june 2016 a couple of weeks later i received an email that my flight was cancelled for 2 september 2016 due to planned mechanical work for the plane and had to reschedule the flight i had two connecting flights that i had to rebook to accommodate the change but i had to pay both airlines 200 each to rebook i asked for help from la compagnie but all they would say was they were sorry even though they are the ones to cancel the original flight 2 months out to top matters i had to return home early and changed days to return thru la compagnie and they charged me 800 to change i asked for some help with the 800 fee i mentioned the cost of the original flight changes cost to me and again all i received was i am sorry but nothing i can do
21126,tunisair,4,tunisair customer review,we flew from heathrow to tunis as ba let us down with a schedule change so we didnt exactly choose this airline as we were left with no choice the flight was not exactly cheap the plane took off nearly an hour late the passenger next to me told me they are always late on board there is no entertainment not even in inflight magazine the food was poor and my partners veggie meal didnt materialise a fact which the air hostess took great delight in confirming he wasnt even offered a snack or an extra drink by way of an apology my seat was broken so kept reclining even though i didnt want it to which must have been very annoying for the person behind me other seats seemed to be having the same issue the cabin was dated and filthy we landed only 15 minutes late having made up time but the luggage took an hour to take the short journey from the aircraft to the tiny terminal at tunis when we checked in at our hotel in tunis and we told them wed flown with tunisair they told us laughing you shouldnt have clearly this airline has an appalling reputation journey home was similar experience
17014,royal brunei airlines,4,not choose to fly rba again,melbourne to hong kong return via bandar seri begawan outbound from australia to brunei there were just four passengers in business class yet when i submitted my meal preference not two hours into the flight i was advised that it was unavailable and asked to choose something else i accepted that reality at the time and emailed royal brunei airlines after our trip to complain no acknowledgement or response ever nothing two years later and two issues about which i sought to engage the airline outbound from brunei for hong kong i was unimpressed by the torn and ragged seat upholstery facing me on the back of the two seats ahead of us i wrote to rba about this and another matter again the response was nothing six months later i finally manage to drag them into communication and although the response was professionalpolite i had clearly become their serialpest not a customer deserving of respect to the other matter upon being called to board the late evening bruneimelbourne flight we followed instructions to proceed to gate it turns out that gate was at the furthest end of one of their new finger piers we walked down the totally empty pier to its farthest extremity and sat in the boarding lounge after about 20 minutes the staff showed up and beckoned us through the gate for a boarding check we were then directed to walk all the way back along the totally empty finger pier to the terminal hub from whence wed come where we found our boarding gate was open and we could proceed onto the aircraft i asked the airline to explain this piece of silliness over a series of responses i was told a lot of international airports require you to walk a long distance perhaps so but not in order to return to where you started and rba does not own the airport and has no control over the airport administrations requirements a pitiful excuse considering bwn is the primary airport in the nation of brunei and is the home base for rba and finally the australian government has security requirements that caused this i am unhappy because it takes you half a year to drag the airline into communication you are admonished for not having complained to the cabin crew at the time the crew had adequate opportunity to notice the cabin furnishing damage but obviously had not you are liedto regarding the reasons some particular passenger management action has occurred you are not a satisfied customer we have disposed of our royal skies membership cards and will not choose to fly royal brunei airlines again
3295,airasia india,3,not informing the customers,hyderabad to delhi this is my second trip on airasia india and i came to know only after reaching the airport no call sms etc during my last travel also there was no prior intimation and the flight kept getting delayed after i reached the airport i had to take an off from office the next day due to airasia i understand that airlines have operational issues causing delays but not informing the customers is unacceptable
6359,canaryfly,8,good value company,fuerteventura to las palmas with canaryfly and a really good value company the most basic seat price included 6 kg hand baggage and 20 kg hold baggage plus basic refreshments checkin boarding and flights were all totally without incident a minor request tea would be a nice alternative to coffee the outward flight was no more than half full and the flight back cant have been more than a third full with so many nonspanish local residents and visitors i think it would be a very worthwhile investment for them to provide their website into english it was clearly the intention the icon is there but im sure it would pay off to do it sooner rather than later the market is surely there but ive spoken to many local residents who had never heard of the company
17342,ryanair,8,fundamentally you do get what you pay for,ive flown ryanair many times over the years fundamentally you do get what you pay for therefore im reviewing based on its price appropriate for a 50min i couldnt complain at all left on time arrived a few mins ahead small cabin bag enough for the weekend

21684,vietnam airlines,3,they need to get their act together,from melbourne to ho chi minh city the plane was an hour late that stated a chain reaction that culminated in missing our connecting flight to da nang the rescheduled flight was also late amounting to 3 hours overall late the premium economy seat was was okay to start with but became more uncomfortable as the journey progressed the foot rest would not stay up and so i had to wedge my shoe under it to keep it from falling onto my ankle the recline was difficult to use and i found others struggling to get it to move the earphones were terrible the movie selection was also terrible and very limited there was nothing i wanted to watch the food was also a bit disappointment given vietnams reputation for food as i am into wine again a big let down there was only one white and one red and of very dubious quality the crew were good all of these issues are easily solvable it appears cost cutting and some poor management decisions have culminated at the customer end vietnam airlines could be great as they have a great crew but they need to get their act together my first a350 and a big disappointment
20481,thomson airways,7,extra leg room a waste of money,manchester to cancun with thomson we had paid for extra leg room which i felt was a waste of money as the seat is not as wide and felt uncomfortable in the middle seat there was no foot rest which would have made the 10 hour flight slightly more comfortable the entertainment was good but not what i was expecting food was nothing different to what ive had on previous flights staff were far from helpful on the outbound flight toilets are more spacious than other aircraft on the whole the dreamliner is overated in my experience and was disappointed slighty better on the way back as managed to get an aisle seat which was spare but meant sitting apart from my husband snacks very expensive compared to other airlines but complimentary drinks are available throughout the flight all in all ive travelled on better and more comfortable airlines i found flying with airtours 14 years ago to cancun was a more comfortable and enjoyable experience then the dreamliner
665,aigle azur,2,definitely the last time,berlin to paris orly bought the ticket online a week ago and it was impossible to add a luggage i connected on the official website add my luggage for 25 eur received a mail saying it was charged checked the morning of my flight and no luggage added no money debited tried all morning to add a luggage on the bugged website declined declined they it seemed to work since it displayed the total amount of the flight and the luggage of 25eur to discover at check in that that did not work and that they would charge me the double not good second time with aigle azur and always an issue definitely the last time
136,aegean airlines,1,a very bad experience,santorini to athens we had a very bad experience with aegean airlines i bought two tickets and by right have combined baggage of 46kgs however when we dropped off our baggage the staff told us aegean dont combine baggage and charged us for excessive baggage charges although our actual bags combined only 43kgs also they dont accept one of our hand carry suitcase as well which have been travelled through so many airlines like qatar and swiss with no issues and charge us another baggage charges unless you want to be ripped off by this airlines otherwise i highly unrecommend aegean because they will find all their ways to rip you
7049,china southern airlines,9,has been a wonderful experience,flying with china southern airlines has been a wonderful experience i had a last minute upgrade from economy class to business class at baiyun airport and the staff are very helpful in the upgrading process the vip lounge for china southern airlines in baiyun airport is one of the best lounges in china as they provide private washrooms so i can take a shower and refresh myself before the flight the attendants on board are very welcoming and the facilities on plane is quite new we landed on time without delays
6049,british airways,4,wifi didnt work,you can buy sandwiches and crisps but dont expect a hot meal because the plane is a narrow body there are no screens not helping matters is the fact that the ba prebooking shop for food didnt recognise the flight number and the onboard wifi didnt work
4005,allegiant air,1,dont ever fly with allegiant,it was hell from the moment we entered the airport in cincinnati they had zero organization and when we finally got to our gate there was no one at the gate there was no announcements and no gate agent with our take off time came and passed our flight crew arrived and they told everyone were just waiting on the gate agent where is this gate agent no answers no information nothing dont ever fly with allegiant
20549,tigerair,2,not very efficient,flew tigerair from cairns to sydney only because it was 10 cheaper per person than another australian airline shouldnt have bothered and should have taken the other one had to pay for baggage for my husband and i only 15 kg authorized we realized the day before flying that it wouldnt be enough and wanted to add another bag not possible they just dont do it instead you can add extra kilos so we tried to do it online about 10 times which didnt work we then called the help service the next day fare prices had increased i was also supposed to pay 5 fees for this change over the phone that i got free when i said the website didnt work the previous day overall not very efficient very slow couldnt send me the proof of my new registration 34 min over the phone i didnt know it wasnt a free number had to pay over 80 120 for this one call on the plane average minus rating would not recommend this airline at all pay a little bit more and get better service quality and less troubles
22384,volaris,7,i found a great deal on volaris,i found a great deal on volaris to take the family 6 tickets 2 adults and 4 kids ages 10 9 8 and 4 from tijuana to acapulco both legs initially had a stop in mexico city outbound flights were y4 816 tijmex and y4 748 mexaca return flights were y4 904 acamex and y4 813 mex tij i paid just under 1000 usd for all six tickets tickets included 2 checked bags and on the longer flights tijmex and mextij the first row premium for more leg room
7346,comair,7,comair customer review,cape townjohannesburg the service was extremely attentive and catering outstanding the cabin and seating of ba comair aircraft mean they fall short of the likes of saa b737300 was worn inside rather dingy and dirty looking and the business class cabin was the same as the economy cabin save empty b and e seats this resulted in a rather uncomfortable journey i dont think ill choose another comair flight in business class until their fleet is renewed and material product offering improved
20453,thomson airways,6,extra leg room not worth the extra,gatwick to cancun return i dont enjoy flying so my husband booked the extra leg room on the boeing 787 for this 10 hour flight service was good with free drinks we only had soft drinks and hot food i settled down to watch a film with the screen some 18 away from my face perfect within an hour or so the passenger in front reclined their seat screen now 12 away and totalally restricted the extra area that we had paid for not happy the other comment that i would make was that when the tray was opened for use the back of the chair in front behind the tray was filthy it had what looked like splashes of tea all over it we did report this to the air hostess on the return journey generally though service food toilets all good acceptable cleanliness and extra leg room seats if passenger reclines their seat not worth the extra money
20468,thomson airways,6,you get what you pay for,outbound thomson airways flight to punta cana good with cabin crew very friendly and efficient drinks trolley shortly after take off then meal service standard aircraft food nothing to write home about but filling good entertainment on built in seat back screens seats had good legroom but are rather narrow just pray you are not sitting beside a larger person seat configuration not very good at 333 this only suits familys of three much better to have 252 or 243 this gives more flexibility and enables more people to be closer to an aisle return flight left a lot to be desired due to the non interested crew who were more interested in talking to each other than serving passengers three times i was asked what i would like to drink and each time i responded but due to inattention and conversation with cabin crew i was literally ignored to death drink measures extremely small i was given a small splash of brandy with loads of ice impossible to taste the brandy they had miniatures of spirits on the trolley but would not serve them seats are incredibly thin and uncomfortable they would make a fortune selling blow up pressure cushions on the flight breakfast served shortly before landing was sausage and omelette which was surprisingly tasty the boeing 787 is a fairly comfortable aircraft but is much over hyped claimed to be a lot quieter than comparable aircraft i would dispute this as i have found airbus a330 to be quieter than this there may be something in the claimed air quality as i have not suffered from jet lag as much as before overall a fairly good flight which could be greatly improved by reminding cabin crew who pays their wages flew as part of a package holiday with first choice i suppose you get what you pay for
11118,horizon air,8,horizon air customer review,ive flown horizon q400s several times throughout wa or and bc nice planes and i actually prefer them to the crjs flight staff is always good and frankly ive never had a problem with ground staff either
2498,air new zealand,3,reconsider my flying options,auckland to melbourne flight on 21 april and encountered several new challenges firstly the economy class seats are quite cramped and lack the option to recline the headrest cushion pushes your head forward leaving you in an uncomfortable upright position with the screen poorly positioned for viewing or resting the new seats lack low back support and are pretty uncomfortable there is minimal space under the seat in front of you for a small laptop bag and the seats above row 28 abc were reserved for life craft a cabin staff informed me that i could only store one bag in the overhead compartment and the other under the seat in front of me the works package offers the option to request additional food and drink i used to be proud of and recommend the high quality standards and service of air new zealand i dont think i can do this anymore and will reconsider my flying options with this airline
16654,regent airways,4,have to throw out accessories,kolkata to chattogram problem occurred at boarding pass counter limit of my bags weight 35 it shows on boarding counter scale but just 30 minutes ago i traveled from delhi to kolkata by air india ok though i agree with this i have a hand bag of 05 kg if the counter lady have gave me the opportunity for transferring some of my accessories to my hand bag then problem solved moreover do 3kg very much overweight i have to throw out some accessories from my bag after then i get my boarding pass very nice experience
1469,air china,6,forgot to ask for drink choices,i took a business class trip from beijing to london and the service was not as good as previous trips the crew greeted me in a pleasant manner and presented me with welcome drinks etc however when one female crew member took my dinner order she forgot to ask for drink choices and it also applied to the person next to me none of us had any drinks with our meal and it was in biz class my prebooked special meal did not turn up until i asked either their procedure was to check with special meal requests then serve but this was not done correctly my friend asked me to complain onboard i didnt think that particular member of staff was worth of complaining its the natural ability to serve and to do a good job that she is lacking other than that the flight in biz class was comfortable enough the drinks were plenty
9595,flair airlines,1,choose a different airline,luckily westjet had a flight the same night so i could get to my destination the online system was unavailable the agent could not speak english very well at the airport and no one would answer a phone call for help choose a different airline if your time is valuable and you dont want to miss a day catching another flight
13039,korean air,4,not use this airline again,seoul to tokyo narita i use my moms credit card to buy my flight ticket but when i was check in at the counter in incheon they required me to show my moms credit card if not i need to buy a new ticket again refund for old ticket because i study in seoul and my mom is in thailand it is impossible to show them but i asked other friends who also use theirs parents card to buy they doent need to show the card so it is kinda confuse me also the flight was delay for 1 hour too anyways i really hate this process and it quite annoying i will not use this airline again in the future
20237,thai smile airways,7,exorbitant cost of baggage,the service and capability of thai air is always very well done and pleasant the crew is always affable my issue is the exorbitant cost of baggage over 20kg as they now charge 180bahtper kilo it had been 90bahtkg i also question the accuracy of their scales it certainly made my flight much more expensive than originally anticipated in fairness i will note that the luggage checkin attendant did give me a small break on the overage price
9250,ravn alaska,6,delayed with no explanation,anchorage to homer last 4 times i have flown with ravn alaska my flights been delayed with no explanation given at any point starting to think maybe ravn alaska just doesnt know how fast their planes go other than that i have no issues but waiting an extra hour or more every time i fly is getting old
21901,virgin australia,7,oh my the seats are tight,was pretty happy with virgin we were only delayed about 15 minutes boarding was good but oh my the seats are tight my husband is not terribly tall and he struggled i would suggest any tall people go for the exit rows only water was offered but being just a short flight that was fine i didnt bother with entertainment rather enjoyed the view it was a nice easy flight stress free shame its so squeezy
1074,air berlin,4,avoid this nasty airline,dusseldorf to berlin a short flight my connection between miami and berlin and as such it should be ok but i am frustrated i had booked an aisle seat but on boarding i found it changed unnoticed to a middle seat while the flight is short and endurable i vow to avoid this nasty airline which has failed in many respects not befitting the german name for supposedly quality
17910,shanghai airlines,7,shanghai airlines customer review,peknkg and shaszx the flight from pek was on a very old 757 with the narrowest seat pitch ive ever seen im only 57 and my knees touched the seat in front of me the bathroom was ancient and had only bar soap on the plus side the breakfast was decent shaszx was after my china eastern flight made an emergency landing so shanghai airlines used a 767 instead of a 757 the 767 was new and was quite comfy attendants friendly and sometimes nagged a bit about putting carryons in other bins that had space food also was good on this flight theres absolutely no inflight entertainment there are headphone jacks but the system does not work
8735,emirates,3,service on the plane was horrible,we traveled with a group of 5 going to karachi via dubai was great as we were able to pay to upgrade to business class on the return flight we were not able to pay for the upgrade option as there was no availability from the check in counter at the karachi airport to the transfer of the wheel chair passenger with me to the flight back to houston the experience was horrible the person working at the emirates counter in karachi asking for a indirect bribe to the incompetent staff at the dubai airport making us wait like a hour for wheel chair staff to transport us to the lounge as we waited for the connecting flight when i asked to make sure we the wheel chair passengers are taken to the plaza lounge he asked how i had access i stated through amex business platinum it was non of his business as an emirates employee to ask to see my card for a lounge the service on the plane was horrible full of very overworked and tired flight staff that looked worn out and unhappy not sure i will fly with emirates after this
15064,nok air,1,dont fly with this airline,bangkok to mae sot district with nok air dont fly with this airline if there are others choices the legroom on q400 is horrible the cabin quite smelly the service was fine way too far from low cost premium airline as they called themselves
3125,airasia,5,gets you from a to b,low cost airline or more like midcost in a postcovid world so expectations should be set accordingly but gets you from a to b midage aircraft narrow seats and pitch basic food available for purchase and minimal service premium flex is a waste of money as no checkin or boarding lineup or luggage priority as promised ticket changes or cancellation are painful
7671,croatia airlines,9,staff smart and friendly,gatwick to split check in was one of the fastest we have encountered desk opened early our flight to split was comfortable enough leg room plane clean one of the cleanest we have been on in economy 18 year old a320 staff smart and friendly small enjoyable snack given plus drinks all included in price plus benefit of reduction for being a seniorpensioner though downside you cannot book emergency exit seats for extra leg room however flight only couple of hours long so not necessary return flight again check in process prompt staff friendly enough but once snack served they stayed chatting at back of plane this was our first time flying with croatian but it will not be the last
1479,air corsica,7,air corsica customer review,a good trip i did parisorlycalvi and calvimarseille these trips were fairly good staff at the airport and cabin crew where very good biscuits and a drink served onboard totally normal for the time of the flight which is not longer than one hour and a half however the seat was really small
9312,fiji airways,5,poor amenities offered,nadi to singapore took fj1361 on 29th of december after my flight on the 28th got canceled due to a cyclone it is understandable it was a weather related cancellation but what is not understandable is they planned a supplementary flight approximately 12 hours before the scheduled time of flight but they did not have crew to operate the flight as a result of this our flight was delayed by 2 hours and we missed our connection from singapore and i was forced to pay 1300 to buy a new ticket in singapore the crew were friendly and tried their best to ensure we make our connection but alas the 2 hour delay led us to missing our flight the quantity of food was poor we had to ask for second serves the entertainment was poor their team leader for economy was very friendly helpful and patient there was this other female senior cabin crew working economy who was just as good the friendliness of the crew is the only saving grace here the lavatory was basic had no lotion no moist towels no toothbrush etc i am extremely disappointed with the poor amenities offered on nadi singapore flights
11128,horizon air,4,horizon air customer review,a subsidiary of alaska airlines ive flown them many times into billings mt from both seattle and portland or i had one bad experience where the early morning flight i was on was canceled because of crew problems i was not able to get out until late that night on a flight that was 2 hours late i received a 1000 meal ticket and that was about it all other times the flights have been good on the last one in october 2007 beer and wine from oregon was complimentary and the flight staff were friendly informative and entertaining i will continue to use them
22959,xiamen airlines,2,should be more transparent,hong kong to xiamen upon arriving at hkg airport my gate was still unannounced i spoke with the airline representative many times as did other passengers and nothing was posted on the departure board about our takeoff or a delay or any gate even after scheduled departure time there hadnt been any notifications of a delay finally we were told which gate to go to we boarded the plane two hours late and had to wait 30 minutes more as the flight attendant said it took that long to load the luggage even though less than half of the plane was full when my phone died i asked an attendant if they could help me to charge it as i didnt know the chinese name of my hotel in xiamen he refused several times until i was very persistent that it would not had died if i had not waited so long for the flight landing was smooth but on the way back the same issues existed all the while announcements on the speaker mentioned how important guests were to xiamen airlines i didnt feel that at all the staff should be more transparent and clear with guests about delays and procedures as delays of that magnitude require changes in planning and sometimes result in losses
17379,s7 siberia airlines,9,the flights were on time,moscow vienna nice flight ive already used s7 for domestic flights so decided to fly with them internationally and i was pretty satisfied by the whole trip the aircraft were fine i guess it was a319 for both ways there was enough space for the legs in the economy seats my height is 184m and both planes looked new lunch was not very big but tasty enough the choice of beverages was a bit limited what i find important all the flights were on time the workers in airport and on board made they job quickly and professional
12941,klm royal dutch airlines,6,better than us carriers generally,boarding wasnt particularly efficient at ams however aircraft was very clean had a nice new klm magazine to read and the staff were friendly and professional seat was a bit cramped and there was no inflight entertainment water and little snacks were distributed unremarkable but positively so ive always had positive overall experiences flying with klm although i wouldnt have wanted to be so cramped if id flown transatlantic instead to just bucharest still better than us carriers generally

9889,flyone,1,no compensation was given,flyone our flight was postponed three times for a day again for a day and for 6 hours then the flight was cancelled the hotel was not provided can you imagine wait for several days at the airport other flights from chisinau by flyone were also cancelled no compensation was given for the build other passengers whom we met at the airport said that even before that it was normal for them flyone to postpone flights for a day i will not buy tickets for this airline again it is also important to insure your trip
21320,united airlines,9,premium plus seat was comfortable,i booked this flight anticipating to fly on united 78710 however it was swapped to a 777200 as it was a retrofitted 777 with proper premium plus seats it was not bad lax is certainly not the best airport as the boarding area was tiny thus very crowded the premium plus seat was comfortable we had the first row with huge legroom more like 55in rather than the normal 38in pitch inflight meals were fine and they served a full meal plus a light meal by choice that was quite good for a 45 hour domestic flight in premium economy the fight departed on time and arrived early which was good
15160,norse atlantic airways,7,very pleasantly surprised,i was very pleasantly surprised with my experience with norse the flight was comfortable with ample leg room for a discount ticket i didnt buy any meals because the flight was in the middle of the night for my time zone and the flight itself only ended up being 556 hours total i have no issues or complaints i got to paris from the us for only 180
5341,bangkok airways,5,wait at the airport for 4 hours,mandalay to chiang mai i am now at mandalay airport waiting for my flight which is supposed to take off at 1800 local time the fact is that i could only learn about my flight delay when i arrive at the airport now i will have to wait at the airport for 4 hours instead of two plus i can find no one to talk to about this issue because the counters will be open according to the new time of the flight i wonder how i will be compensated now it would be nice at least to have a meal ticket to use at the airport my flight from chiang mai was also delayed but then i was sent an email
17057,royal jordanian airlines,4,wifi does not let you access anything,i ordered the lasagna but it was horrible i couldnt pull it apart because they put the cheese first on top so it was literally impossible to eat it the entertainment website on board i think has less than 60 movies and the wifi does not let you access anything except their website they do not even offer a package so you can speak with your family members

15347,olympic air,2,staff was unaware of such visa,i and two of my friends had a flight from santorini to athens i had a long term schengen visa which allowed me to roam the european union before i came to santorini where my visa was checked multiple times turned out the ground staff was unaware of such visa thanks to one person among those who let me in then one of the air hostess skipped me for the chocolates and cookies though i dont have any complaints from other air hostess who were friendly and fine
20443,thomson airways,6,professional crew,overnight flight from puerto vallarta to london gatwick with thomson left on time and arrived very early at gatwick professional crew who dealt well with obnoxious customers food and drink was served efficiently tasty but small portions seats felt more uncomfortable than on the way out as this was a night flight attempted to sleep did not enjoy ife as choice very limited indeed horrendous queue at check in pv unacceptably long

16249,porter airlines,4,customer service was of no help,save yourself fly any other airline our porter airlines flight from montreal to toronto was diverted to sudbury we waited in a small holding area for hours no food and limited bathroom usage not enough seats for half the people crammed in the space we were boarded and flown back to toronto only to have our flight to chicago cancelled this was 1231 we were rebooked for 15 we both work and have kids at home so there was no way we were able to spend an additional 5 days in toronto customer service was of no help we ended up purchasing tickets on a different airline to get home i would never use this airline again under any circumstance
16022,philippine airlines,3,i recommend avoiding them,they delayed my flight a total of 3 times 2 of wich were without notice and caused me to miss a connecting flight i had to wait for 5 extra hours on the airport and they were extremely slow in the handling of the baggage too making me fear they had lost my bags because they werent even sure where they had put them the cheap price is not worth the hassle and i recommend avoiding them if you have any connecting flights
17604,saudi arabian airlines,3,jeddah was chaotic and slow,i did fly with saudia for the first time it was on the route between man jed mnl and i was returning 3 weeks after the aircraft and the cabin crew no concerns food and beverages were good but during the 11 hours second leg only 2 meals were served interchange in jeddah the airport has no drinking water unless you buy in one of the very expensive shops there the airport has a very few toilets for males but plenty for females not sure why the interchangetransit in jeddah was chaotic and slow there was no clear signs where to go and there was not enough staff to guide passengers during the flights passengers were praying on the plane on the floor one thing is certain i have learnt the arabic prayers by heart as they were playing it on multiple occasions before and after the take off
15416,olympic air,5,olympic air customer review,my daughter 10yrs flew paris to zakynthos through athens on 18th july with the unaccompanied services she did tell me about the um service in athens when she got there she was taken to a room with other children to wait 3 hours for the next flight the staff in the room who was supposed to look after them smoked all the time this is absolutely shocking to see the way they treat children
20461,thomson airways,2,no smiles or kind words,trip to jamaica on 21st may from manchester with thomson boarded on time but an issue with seating in the economy cabin delayed us on the tarmac for an hour cabin crew were trying to sit a woman next to her child the passenger was not cooperating and the cabin crew didnt handle it well when we were finally in the air all of the crew were obviously not happy with what had happened and proceeded to take it out on all of us poor passengers no smiles or kind words scared to even ask for another drink the captain was good at keeping us informed though on the return journey crew were slightly better but as it was a night flight didnt see them much same issue on way back with seating but thankfully we werent delayed inflight entertainment was rubbish to say the least and 9 hours with nothing good to watch was not fun will try another company next time

9560,firefly,5,firefly customer review,penanglangkawi on atr flight was on time crew worked excellent together and the flight attendants were cheerfully serving orange juice and water during this 20 minute flight a very good experience
18589,smartwings,8,recommend the airline,we booked a ticket with czech airlines from dubai to prague and we were told we will fly with smartwings the ticket price was too hard to refuse so we went for it the website was a bit confusing on luggage and foodentertainment great check in service and aircraft wonderful crew and service there was warm food drinks some czech movies on small drop down cabin screen and an on time experience highly recommend the airline
5401,bangkok airways,6,id recommend them,phnom penh to bangkok nice check in dedicated counter lovely lounge with comfortable chairs and good food boarding was good then we sat and sat and sat at least an hour waiting for approval to take off took a long time fa were fine not overly proactive but pleasant there was only three of us in business the food choice of two was awful awful poor quality hot meal what a shame three course yuk even dessert was dreadful we parked in an outer area and had a mini bus take the three of us to arrivals we had been given an express pass so immigration was quick and our bags were off early we were out of the airport in 20 minutes id recommend them but i think id go economy next time
1952,air india express,4,air india express customer review,dxbixe boarded with apprehension but quite pleasantly surprised reasonably clean aircraft pleasant crew and food not bad for a budget airline and way better than air india the so called full service airline have flown them a couple of times again on the same sector
15287,norwegian,1,flights have been good,gatwick to san francisco i have flown with norwegian numerous times in recent years flights have been good although delays seem more likely than with some airlines service on board is good staff always friendly and helpful planes are clean and comfortable food is on par with other airlines not particularly good but pick around and youll probably find something edible on the trayin the box checking in used to be easy enough but on recent trip to usa i was expected to type in endless details about where i was going and exactly where i was staying not the sort of information youve got in your hand at the checkin terminal id already provided all this advance information on their website i recently cancelled a flight the fare was nonrefundable but taxes are refundable norwegian made no effort to refund for over three months and only did refund because i kept contacting them constantly ignoring my requests or fobbing me off for this reason i give them a low score
9804,flydubai,4,definition of paying more for less,i had sworn to never fly with flydubai after an 8 hour delay in 2016 however after booking with emirates i had no choice but to choose the codeshare agreement inbound flight with flydubai because everything else was sold out due to the long weekend in bahrain dxbs terminal 2 t2 is a flea market and there is nowhere to sit and eat in addition to the toilets smelling of course we were crammed in buses with zero distancing measures the plane was super hot and the crew members looked like they were about to pass out the air conditioners didnt work properly and there was no monitors for inflight entertainment we were also provided with flydubais baggage allowance which was less than emirates i cant forgive emirates for their codeshare flights via flydubai because they are the literal definition of paying more for less flydubai is not even that cheap anymore when it comes to regional gcc flights avoid if you have other options the staff were friendly and the male crew member in the economy cabin was very patient
1416,air china,9,in flight service efficient,london to phnom penh via beijing not the newest of aircraft but plenty of space due to old style 333 seating rather than 343 favoured by many airlines acceptable food better than ba but not to emirates or qatar standard in flight service efficient and staff on both flight were keen to help and engage with passengers i was particularly impressed with the purser and crew on our second flight who handled the cabin very well and professionally during turbulence and showed care when dealing with passengers i would put air china somewhere above the volume us airlines who tend to serve food in boxes around ba but below the middle east airlines for the price point circa 450 round trip they are very good
14172,lufthansa,1,legroom in economy was below minimum,legroom in economy was below minimum with the backrest in front of you at the back position you cannot eat or have a tablet on the table the seat becomes uncomfortable after 34 hours one snack vegan wrap and one meal vegetarian pasta or chicken with couscous was served taste was ok wine was offered free of charge crew was not very friendly infotainment was good lot of movies to decide and an usbsocket
12667,joon,3,not recommended,paris cdg to oslo highprice highdensity seats the crew kept crashing with pax several times when serving from the trolleys crew uniform seemed like tshirts and did not fit a crew the crew made the wrong announcement before landing as much as the crew kept smiling and apologizing it felt like the crew had little experience not recommended
3792,akasa air,7,ticket price is competitive,lcc currently operating only on domestic route have all boeing 737 max fleet seats are just ok for short 12 hr flights cant expect more from a budget carrier boarding was systematic and smooth cabin was clean and fresh cabin crew were courteous departed and arrived on time ticket price is competitive no major reason to avoid
21874,virgin australia,6,friendly flight attendants,unfortunately there was a delay of 1 hour otherwise a pleasant flight easy check in friendly flight attendants and a clean plane possibly they could offer more options for food eg the option of pre booking and pre paying a meal
422,aerolineas argentinas,1,more than 8 hours waiting,horrible service flight from buenos aires to rio de janeiro supposed to depart at 1820 on the 31st may 2019 and it was delayed to 215am the next morning more than 8 hours waiting and no one knows anything gave us a voucher to eat in a poor place called la churrasquita should give a voucher that we choose where we eat and a place to stay and sleep
2178,air malta,2,i wasnt impressed,gatwick to malta i wasnt impressed with the airline at all firstly we were delayed the airplane itself was 20 years and in bad condition it however was a wet lease plane so there was no branding inside or any livery on the plane the staff was werent great but werent awful however they were below average then on arrival the pilots completely messed up taxiing to the gate i decided against flying with a lcc as its the xmas period i wanted more of a relaxing and customer friendly flight none of that is what i received
18763,southwest airlines,1,i am disgusted with southwest,i am handicapped in that i have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old i asked for a wheelchair when i booked the flight as i always do this time when i arrived at the airport in philadelphia to return home this was a round trip booking i checked in at the counter and reminded them that i had signed up for a wheelchair she told me to sit down and one would arrive this seemed normal as i have always traveled on southwest and this was the routine well i sat there for over half an hour periodically asking a variety of southwest personnel about the wheelchair they said it was on the way when my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes i began to panic when i asked at the desk again the woman said why dont you just walk i was beginning to think that they thought i could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair i needed at that point i saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it i asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she worked for airline and couldnt take southwest passengers then she said that if i could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me she told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate the plane was boarding it was very clear that had i not approached this person and practically begged her to take me i would have missed my plane my connecting flight and heaven knows when i could have gotten home this would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job i am disgusted with southwest and i never thought i would say this but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs when i called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair in this case there was no wheelchair or pusher and i know thats not true if they dont want to provide this service it should not be offered when i book the flight then i would go to another airline also when the person behind the desk told me to just walk to the gate it was clear that they were not taking my disability seriously and really had no intention of helping me
16743,regional express,4,regional express customer review,mel bwt return relatively easy checkin boarding on short 1 hour flight teacoffee nibbles served by friendly fa a minor problem was in the different configuration of the aircraft all are saab 340 on outward flight there were overhead lockers above the 2 seat side of the aircraft but on the return when we had extra carryon there was none fortunately the flight was only half full so we could store it under the next seat they do a good job for a regional airline
6137,brussels airlines,2,whole exchange was extremely unfriendly,we were flying to my sons wedding the visas were delayed so had to put departure back two days brussels airlines wanted to charge us 1400 we could get the same trip elsewhere for 600 so asked to cancel the outward trip and retain the return trip they started by charging us 160 for the both of us and said they would call us back they never did when i called back the price went up to 450 to keep a flight i had already paid for i told them i had been quoted 160 but they would not budge i refused to pay it and bought entirely new flights from another airline the whole exchange was extremely unfriendly i will never touch this airline again
15227,norwegian,6,overall the experience was good,this is a follow up on my review from yesterday after the technical delay some people insisted on getting off the plane causing a further delay2 hours total the flight itself was smooth service and food was good overall the experience was good under difficult circumstances big picture the technical difficulties were spotted and solved on the ground and relatively quickly
11844,japan airlines,3,seat had no storage,melbourne to tokyo did not get off to a good start when business check in was cluttered with economy passengers then ushered to economy desk lounge was an insult to business class passengers on board the seat while comfortable had no storage window aisles had some first business class flight i have flown where a welcome drink was not offered amenity kit had no socks i did not eat on the aircraft but the flight crew were attentive and polite i doubt i would choose this airline again for business class travel which is a shame as i had previously flown premium economy and found them brilliant
1866,air india,7,food was improved,have not travelled with this airline since 2016 but this time the crew and food was improved we had 3 flights with them cochin to mumbai mumbai to aurangabad return to mumbai
7546,copa airlines,2,my recommendation is to use another airline,i am gold member for more almost 10 years with copa there is absolutely no difference between elite status and economy in this airline there is not even a preferential line for boarding the vip lounge has only coke and chips and unfortunately the service of the staff is bad all around my recommendation if the choice is available is to use another airline american airlines for the same route for instance is excellent and cheaper
16827,rossiya airlines,5,nothing outside of the ordinary,i took a trip on aeroflot from moscow to st petersburg operated by rossiya airlines i booked the flight late so i paid a considerable premium on the ticket that said it was cheaper than the roundtrip ticket on the sapsan highspeed train from moscow to peter as expected for a holiday weekend the flight was at or near capacity the a319 had more leg room than my last flight on the a319 i flew with s7 airlines but not much more boarding is not by zones or by class it seems in russia it is whoever gets in line first and a bit chaotic the line typically forms quickly before boarding and it is better to be early in line basic economy traveling is cheap within russia but like airlines worldwide the charges add up with luggage etc so everyone tries to just bring carryon bags therefore if you have carryon luggage you need to get in the line early or you might not find any overhead storage space the flight is relatively short about 15 hours so you can tolerate a little discomfort the flight attendents were professional but not friendly once airborne they hastily served a small rather tasteless snack and choice of water tea or coffee no juice or alcoholic beverages the temperature in the cabin was very warm an experience that i have had on every flight i have taken inside of russia russians tend to like it warm but this was a bit too warm on the return flight to moscow we sat in a holding pattern above vnukovo airport for about 45 minutes and ended up reaching the gate 35 minutes late no reason given by the pilot when he informed us of the delay but delays sometimes happen because vnukovo2 is used for flights of highranking government officials overall since i booked the tickets late it was an expensive flight so value for the money might be skewed to the negative however that was my fault that said the flight was nothing outside of the ordinary
21885,virgin australia,7,a good experience,i enjoyed the trip check in was easy as was the bag drop at melbourne airport the flight was slightly delayed but it was no big deal the staff were friendly and helpful the cost only included beverage or food and water but for such a short flight that was no big deal overall a good experience
16437,qantaslink,8,a comfortable flight,a comfortable flight seated in a pair of two seats on the left of the aircraft the ground service and on board service were friendly and efficient and we were pleasantly surprised to get a tasty snack and an alcoholic or nonalcoholic drink on this short leg plus an easter chocolate the flight operated about 20 mins late there was no attempt to enforce the airlines policy on takeon baggage luckily we were on early and could find space for our takeon bags over our seats but other people were struggling due to the suitcasesize bags allowed on board
4460,anadolujet,9,very pleasant service onboard,totally fully flight smooth and very friendly check in clean aircraft very pleasant service onboard flight left and arrived on time with regular pilot updates must mention and thank mr metin whom i believe to be the station manger at stansted airport for going out of his way helping my old mother carrying one of our bags down the stairs as the escalator was inoperable even we did not ask for help
4672,asiana airlines,8,inflight service was decent,los angeles to hong kong via seoul los angeles to seoul incheon was a solid experience since it was an redeye flight the catering was below average everything was oily however the tea selections after the meal was a delight cas need to learn how to behave in the galley when passengers are sleeping i sat three rows in front of the galley and i literally thought there was a mariachi band behind me overall the inflight service was decent
18401,sky express airlines,1,dont recommend it at all,i booked a flight and went to the airport an hour before the flight the gate opened 30 minutes before the flight for only 5 minutes i lost the flight as the queue for the check in at skyexpress was huge ive already waited 30 minutes at the queue i asked for a manager to find a solution and there was no one at the airport representing sky express i was forced to book another flight as it was the only solution and lost 75 ill never again book a flight with sky express and i definitely dont recommend it at all
601,aeromexico,2,kept the money from a canceled flight,they kept the money from a canceled flight in 2020 and said they wont refund it nor issue a voucher or anything no matter how many times i contacted them also its very very hard to get a hold of someone and they never reply the email requests
11271,iberia express,6,a pleasant experience,madrid to gatwick flight was on time at first it looks like the seat pitch is fine this has been achieved by removing the seat pocket one normally finds below the tray table however once person in front declined their seat it became very unpleasant the tray table came close to my stomach and it would have been very difficult to use the table fortunately there was an empty row across and one was able to move seats the wifi worked but it only allows you to watch information and movies on iberia express page and you are unable to surf the net or send emails go on facebook etc the movie and tv selection was quite good but as there is no seat charger i didnt want to lose my charge so did not use it in the end the crew were largely absent but drinks and food menu all charged was very adequate for short haul budget flight all in all a pleasant experience bar the ridiculous seats
17322,ryanair,8,very friendly and professional,i was told not to fly this airline for many reasons but i have and i flown this route many times the past year as a route from tlv to paphos there is nothing to complain about beside one flight they all left on time and arrived punctually the delayed flight was a short technical delay of 1 hour staff very friendly and professional prices are the cheapest in the industry food and beverage on board for acceptable prices and i will fly them again beginning of march
16840,rossiya airlines,3,rossiya airlines customer review,online checkin did not exist so i had to use the desk even without bags onboard experience was ok the planes were very old b737500 with nonexistent legroom and an148 where legroom was ok the crews were mature but welcoming their english skills are very basic and announcements were just incomprehensible overall ok but very much postsoviet style all flights on schedule for the price paid i could expect more civilised experience i have never been able to accrue my aeroflot bonus miles on their flights despite them being a daughter business of aeroflot overall very mediocre
9440,finnair,3,worst customer service,the worst customer service i have ever dealt with they lost my bag but the worst part started after that no news about where is my bag 30 days have passed no one helps no one read emails no one picks up the phone no one responds to the reports filed 3 filed so far
18740,southwest airlines,2,why would i ever fly with them again,the day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from houston to san diego we noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict we arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time so i stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the overworked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didnt see anything that was better this phrase came up a lot but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they dont have control of the weather etc regarding delays the only flights from southwest that were delayed were those to san diego it was not weather related as the flights to and from san diego were also on schedule except ours after waiting until we could check luggage 45hrs we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended 5 minute layover agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to boise but she could only see houston connections so i called their 800 number 3rd agent was an explanation followed by holdhangup 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option but because we checked baggage 4 the only person willing to help us had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from san diego to boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us i asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection but that would be unfair to everyone else so we sat in the back i knew i was being lied to but at this point i figured id just wait to see what would happen we fly to san diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a 100 voucher for a later flight yay i looked at my pass and it was an a position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food terminal was super crowded due to construction so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit i mentioned how it was nice that we didnt get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was c30 and his girlfriend was c15 i took our passes to the 7th agent 6 was for new passes and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together she immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers i stated that my original tickets were in the a group for that leg of the flight in an irritated voice but she stuck to her argument at this point i was done with their service so i expressed to her that i had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored she threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor the supervisor 8 and i had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness but she would allow us to board together she mentioned the 100 vouchers but why would i ever fly with them again id pay not to and told her so she also asked why i didnt ask for a supervisor isnt that their job when they cant help a customer flying with southwest is just not worth the trouble they get a 2 rating because their flight staff is actually amazing
6679,cayman airways,1,dont fly cayman airways,dont fly cayman airways 12 hour delay communicated to us every few hours because the flight crew had to rest been in the airport 12 hours now with no reliable takeoff time and no offer of compensation for a full day missed of vacation the customer service is atrocious upon further research i have learned that this is a normal course of business for this airline they do not honor their flight times and fly upon the crews whims save yourself the aggravation and fly jetblue instead
21279,turkmenistan airlines,6,turkmenistan airlines customer review,heathrow to and from ashgabat and have no major complaints the crew struggle with english but we managed to communicate without too much difficulty aircrafts were clean and tidy and legroom good there is no inflight entertainment aboard however the inflight catering was rather good washed down with a generous supply of soft drinks what spoilt the experience was the behaviour of a minority of amritsar bound passengers who chose to openly smoke during the flight when approached by the crew those passengers screamed and shouted that they could not understand the crew requests for cigarettes to be extinguished these passengers chose to play very loud music to the annoyance of those nearby refusing to turn it off fellow amritsarbound passengers were powerless to stop them
7917,cubana airlines,2,cubana airlines customer review,after defunct mexicana left us high and dry in havana the staff at cubana was helpful they had the next flight to cancun 5 hours after our canceled mexicana flight and told us while it was booked there would probably be room for us come back in 2 hours one and half hours later they tracked us down in another part of the airport and practically held our hand taking us from purchase to checkin however then the bad news the flight was delayed about 45 minutes before takeoff for unknown reasons forcing us to miss our united flight in cancun to denver and stranding us for two days due to a labor day crush in cancun and when i saw a wooden floor the first thing when i walked onto the plane and then the exit sign in russian i was skeptical and ive seen better overhead bins on city buses at times i thought it would be my last flight ever but the rubber bands held together and somehow the plane made it
12789,kenya airways,2,its my worst experience,i recently had a trip to dubai on the 10th of july 2022 it was a linking flight from cameroon passing through bangui to nairobi kenya then to dubai honestly speaking its my worst experience so far its been almost two weeks since i arrived dubai but am yet to receive my luggage before leaving the airport on arrival i placed a complain with dnata baggage services regarding my baggage and i was assured that i would get my luggage in less than 48 hours which have turn into two weeks have finished every penny i had on me for mobile top up and when i even call no 1 picks no get back to me have sent emails and gotten no reply maybe next time you inform customers in advance that their luggage arent safe or secured so they would know what to do with their luggage would never recommend this airline to anyone unless they wish to have a similar experience what a waste of my money
2489,air new zealand,6,seats very cramped,seats very cramped except for our original flight to auckland where we had bulkhead seats food and food service satisfactory but we had an outstanding cabin service director excellent with passengers and very good at his jobbest we have seen fight nz 6 from auckland to lax on june 5 2023
12486,jetstar asia,5,didnt get any drink,kuala lumpur to singapore in the beginning i thought the cabin crew were doing a good job because they persisted to get passengers attention during safety instructions however i called the crew 3 times to get a mineral bottle and didnt get any drink because it was too late they said that the plane was going to land soon it was just a short trip and the cabin crew just couldnt act faster i was thirsty and ready to pay 4 for a dasani bottle
5632,blue air,8,extremely satisfied for the price,extremely satisfied for the price considering i managed to pay under 20for the roughly 2h flight i couldnt be happier with the airline the flight was over punctual boarding was easy and uncomplicated and the cabin crew has been really nice and professional the aircraft was new and had the industry standard slim seats which led to a reasonable amount of legroom they even had a recline functionality which is quite unusual for low cost carriers even the infight services have been perfect a big 05l water for only 2 and food for similar competitive prices all in all very satisfied and definitely a better experience than on ryanair flights for a similar price
15548,onur air,7,a good deal for the price i paid,i flew istanbulberlinistanbul for a business trip with onur air the airline was providing a free checked baggage allowance so it was a good deal for the price i paid the online checkin was confusing and i had the impression that it was paid service with this airline in ataturk ist airport there was an onur air common checkin counter which was very efficient and i did not wait more than 5 minutes to check in however on the way back in berlintegel onur air had a terrible checkin line where i waited for 1 hour it was horrible and i assume that those who have cabin baggage really waste their time they cannot checkin online to speed up the process we flew a pegasus airlines plane for both flights there was not enough leg space and there was catering available for a fee
22976,xiamen airlines,9,recommend for the budgetwary traveller,amsterdam to taipei via xiamen with xiamen airlines after reading many reviews here about the transfer service in xiamen i was a bit worried but it turned out ok yes you still need to check yourself and your baggage in at xiamen again but ground staff seem to be used to the procedure by now in amsterdam and in taipei they understood they could only tag our bags to xiamen in xiamen when arriving at customs its best to have printed proof youre transferring but they have a list of transferring passengers theres a counter for free hotel if your wait is longer than 6 hours dont confuse this counter with the transfer service counter thats right next to it thats only for domestic transfers i mistakingly waited in that line for some time the hotel is 20 minutes by taxi but its nice one awkward thing is that they put 2 solo passengers into one room luckily i didnt have any roommate on the long flight both ways they ran out of coconut juice halfway on xiamen to taipei they gave drinks only after the food so you had to eat either thirsty or with cold food on taipei to xiamen they didnt give any drinks at all but maybe that was because i had ordered a special meal when booking china has some strict rules about mobile phones and power banks on the site it says you can do online checkin if you fly from amsterdam but i got an error when i tried maybe that only works if youre not transferring all in all its very cheap and the annoyances are not dealbreakers if youre prepared for them so i recommend it for the budgetwary traveller
4360,ana all nippon airways,5,business class product is superior,the ana business class product is superior and in particular the room the food served in business class is topnotch and the service is impeccable i have absolutely no problem with the inflight experience with ana however their customer service is a joke you cannot get a human being on the phone without an amount of delay every time i call the customer service number of which there is only one i am told the waiting time will exceed 60 minutes and to try again later today i made four calls to ana each time waiting between 45 minutes and one hour before either getting cut off or getting impatient and concluding the call attempt
9363,fiji airways,6,inconsistency of service,los angeles to nadi there is still a lot of work to be done by this airline but dont get me wrong it is my favorite airline and will always be my choice of airline i am still disappointed with the inconsistency of service and on this flight some cabin crew just do not live up to the mark when boarding started one of the cabin crew was standing at the entrance barking at passengers to have their boarding pass ready to show the other cabin crew welcomed everyone on board with a smile during the flight the same cabin crew woke me up rudely to serve my dinner i asked for a vegetarian meal on this flight from los angeles which was just steamed veggies with rice apart from two crew all the rest were wonderful smiling and making their rounds of the cabin the ground staff at la were more friendly and efficient compared to the staff at nadi
13323,lan airlines,4,plane dirty from previous flight,new aircraft but there ends the positives lan airlines website is very poor and online checkin clunky i would suggest that lan scraps its poor website and keeps up with the rest of the oneworld alliance at present it is a poor relative bag drop was not a pleasant experience rude staff who were not interested boarding was shambolic also plane dirty with food from previous flight on tray table food and drinks service was also pretty hit and miss getting off the plane also took an age
16778,rex airlines,9,staff are helpful and courteous,i was supposed to be on a flight at 830am on 6th december but my daughter mixed up the times and i arrived too late joe at the checkin was so helpful and made a phone call and was able to get me on the next flight at no expense i travel frequently between coffs and sydney and the staff are helpful and courteous
11991,jet airways,1,worst airline ever,london to kochi via mumbai worst airline ever never choose this airline even if you had to pay a few more extra for a decent one the connection flight to kochi was found cancelled on reaching mumbai and was offered the next days flight due in 24 hours reduced to provide accommodationlounge access they kept sending messages every week that flight number and times from london changed until the day of travel but i never expected this treatment
21778,virgin america,6,not very service oriented,austin to san francisco the flight from to sfo was uneventful and i had a pretty good experience the return flight not so much in the end the flight was 25 hours late into austin there was no issue with weather it is still unclear why we had such a delay virgin did a very poor job of explaining it and really provided no information about the delay until after our flight was to have departed once we pushed back from the gate it took about 1 hour before we took off then about 20 minutes after takeoff some people started to get up to use the rest room they were quickly scolded since the fasten seat belt sign was still on once the pilot finally turned off the sign about a dozen people jumped out of their seats and formed a long line for the restrooms at the back of the plane i waited a while and once the rest room in the front was unoccupied for a couple of minutes i went up and used it i was in row 5 so very near the front as i returned to my seat the flight attended reminded me that the rest room in the front was for first class i said i understood that but there was a long line in the back and they had already had us on the plane for a couple of hours so i had to do what i had to do she scolded me some more and made me promise that i would not use the first class restroom for the remainder of the flight then another person from row 4 went to use the front rest room she refused to let him and insisted that he join the long line in the back on other flights we have been told that it is also against the rules to form a long line for the rest rooms when the crew came through for drinks they gave mostly ice and only about 23 of a cup of soda i felt that the flight crew was rude and not very understanding given the situation that they created for their customers and not very service oriented the entertainment system was good and the seats were not bad relative to other airlines
13163,kuwait airways,1,they were fantastic,london to manila via kuwait i was very nervous after reading the reviews on here however i have to say they were fantastic the other passengers were a nightmare and i can see why the staff get the hump the way they were treated was criminal
752,air arabia,1,worst airline for everything,worst airline for everything boarding late for more than 1 hour with no information for bus very bad attitude from the staff not recommended to anyone
17089,royal jordanian airlines,2,no luggage shipped for us,not recommended we are three persons flew from istanbul to amman with rj with first class when we arrived amman there was no luggage shipped for us on the return flight at the same class no water or juice served
18102,silkair,8,enjoyable experience,short trip from kuching to singapore but enjoyable experience with silkair check in via the singapore air app on my iphone the day before i fly when i arrived at kuching airport my checkin process was easy the cabin crew friendly and warm egg sandwich served the a319 is quite old and it would be great to see silkair with more new boeing 737 aircraft that come with a usb port silkair studio worked on my ios devices and watched some short tv shows overall it was a joy to fly with silkair
3973,alitalia,5,looked like they would rather have been elsewhere,this was my second time flying with alitalia to johannesburg and i have to say that the first time was better than this the aircraft were all clean and the crew from lhr to fco were pleasant enough however the all male crew to johannesburg although not rude tried very hard not to interact with the passengers i saw one flight attendant smile the whole flight it is sad that the crew all looked like they would rather have been elsewhere during the night there was not a sign of them and compared to other airlines that really lets them down
12563,jetstar pacific,7,overall cant complain,flew hong kong to da nang with jetstar pacific first off its a no frills airline people need to always remember that if you only pay a little bit for your flight youre only going to get a little bit of service if you want to be fanned with palm leaves pay more for a full service carrier the aircraft was newer very clean comfortable although paid a bit extra for the exit row and both to and from da nang were on time at both ends of the journey the staff were pretty good more smiles and attentiveness in da nang than hong kong but i am not taking issue with that at all safe and ontime is all that matters with a low cost carrier we didnt order any food so cant comment first hand on that but the couple in front of us did and they finished it all so it must not have been too bad overall cant complain and further advice would be to read the tc instead of just clicking accept
4785,austrian airlines,2,very bad experience,very bad experience i lost business meetings because of the delays and the bad service they caused me a big lost of money it took more then 12 hours and 3 flights to arrive from tlv to malaga should take max 5 hours of flight first flight from tel aviv to vienna they lost the slot of departure then instead of flying directly to malaga they sent me in a lufthansa flight to frankfort and then another flight from frankfurt to malaga i went out at 200 am and arrive to destination at 1800

19115,srilankan airlines,5,worst experience ever,colombo to dubai i encountered the worst experience ever if youre travelling with kids please do not book this airline when i requested a bassinet for my 8 month old they refused it initially telling me that the bassinet will be too small but in reality it fit my baby perfectly the staff have a major attitude and they are thinking its giving from their hand or pocket
20938,tui airways,5,fly with ryanair next time,tui app was down so i couldnt check in online a member of staff said the app isnt compatible with google flight home was delayed by 4 hours i rang the taxi driver who was picking me up from the airport he said hed check the flight arrival time online but the tui flight tracker wasnt working so he couldnt check the poor taxi driver was waiting for 2 hours at the airport many people ive spoken to have had similar experiences over the last 2 years ryanair are far more competent ill definitely fly with ryanair next time
21696,vietnam airlines,9,we were proud of our airline,the trip was good we were proud of our airline the crews were friendly they served us food and talked to us calmly hope i will have an better experience with business class and an better aircraft on the same airline
6492,caribbean airlines,6,caribbean airlines customer review,postabpos disappointed with the service aircraft is ok but crew seem to be on a rush and wanting to get out of the plane as soon as possible delays are the norm and no excuses its cheap though but service nonexistent on short flights will fly them again as a last option or if they come up with very good price they say they want to be back in the european market good luck for them
18336,sky airline,1,unpleasant flying experiences,sao paulo to santiago one of the most unpleasant flying experiences it seems like the airline staff has no concept of customer service unusually long checkin at the counters took every passenger more than 10 mins to checkin did not accept the online boarding pass so had to stand in a queue on a 4 hour flight they do not even offer water for free 3 for a bottle which is inhumane no inflight entertainment and very uncomfortable seats that do not recline when the flight landed and parked the gates did not open for 30 mins and no explanation was offered which was pathetic
4742,aurigny air,1,aurigny air customer review,flight cancelled out of guernsey due to fog put on a flight 28 hours later which was 30 mins late taking off staff totally disinterested no offer of practical or financial help just told to claim on travel insurance to cap it all we were placed right in the middle of a noisy football team when we finally got away
2658,air nostrum,7,leg room was adequate,alicante to madrid short flight to connect to a long haul flight ground staff were efficient at iberia desk as usual you have to leave larger carry on bags on the ground next to the plane and then pick them up on arrival next to the plane seats are leather and on a 2 by 2 basis in both business and economy service was adequate leg room was adequate even for two over six footers
14074,lucky air,5,lucky air customer review,nanjing to kunming on a new b737 as i was sitting in in seat 1f had a lot of legroom cabin crew was excellent i was served a tasty dish on the 3 hour flight for the return flight the ground staff ticketing desk in kunming was outstanding
10936,hawaiian airlines,7,what deceptive business practices,so utterly disappointed i booked my ticket under the airlines websites promise of no change fee after calling to change my travel dates due to work turns out there is a change fee furthermore the fare differential to make the travel date change is higher than if i were to rebook a new ticket thats just great ai driven pricing software what deceptive business practices hawaiian airlines has one of the very best cabin service in my opinion yet their ticketing and customer service which is farmed out to a 3rd world call center staffed by 5th world personnel seems substandard compared to other airlines emptor caveat buyer beware behind that warm aloha spirit they are still a money making machine first and foremost customer service be damned
1566,air europa,4,very bad organization,what a hectic flight late already and while starting to roll the pilot says that we have a engine problem and must return to the stand 30 minutes in the plane stranded and we told to leave because of tests to the plane 45 minutes in the gate and they change the gate and dont say a thing and boarding as fast as we could and no control no food no nothing just board and up we go very bad organization
7449,conviasa,8,conviasa customer review,three trips between ccs and bla i found conviasa to be clean modern friendly and welcoming my spanish is functional but quite basic and when i struggled there was usually multilingual staff even on the short hop from caracas to barcelona and back luggage allowance on this flight is a generous 30kg and a free drink is provided despite the flight time being only 3040 minutes seats comfortable with more room than i was expecting all in all conviasa offer a superior albeit slightly more expensive service on this short route than do their competitors avior
22992,xiamen airlines,3,premium price for no class airline,kuala lumpur to fuzhou with xiamen airlines and paid premium price for no class airline delays on outward and return flight food was quite poor and served in paper boxes same menu there and back and same lack of taste inflight entertainment was nonexistant and the cabin crew were rushed and at times sounded like giving orders seats were not comfortable and not much different from many low cost carriers departure at fuzhou was a mess and almost every bag needed to be manually checked you would imagine that the counter staff could speed things up by giving advice on chinas special baggage rules note do not pack your powerbank and certain electrical items in your luggage
15972,philippine airlines,4,wasnt like a full service airline,i just had bad flight because there was no ac no entertainment during 4 hours flight its wasnt like a full service airline also they moved gate suddenly in bali and manila overall 4 star based on my experience
3417,airasia x,3,separated our group,our family of five 2 adults 3 kids aged 12 11 7 recently flew air asia from kuala lumpur to melbourne air asia auto assigned seats at online checkin that separated our group which placed our 7 year old seven rows behind the rest of the family even though there were plenty of seats of 5 together on the flight leaving us no option but to purchase seats also we hired their tablets for entertainment but one didnt work the cabin crew advised us to contact their customer support who werent interested

17024,royal brunei airlines,8,really cheap and not that bad,melbourne to kota kinabalu via bander seri begawan on royal brunei the boeing 787 business class was superior than i thought it was going to be yes they dont serve any kind of alcohol however its possible to buy a small bottle in duty free after security and bring it on the plane with you the crew will not serve it to you however ask for a mixer and ice and do it yourself the seats laid down to a flat bed and at 6ft 4inches roughly it was just a little short to lie on my back im 6ft 7 however with a bit of adjustment i was able to get comfortable and sleep the only negative thing about the seat was the headrest its not moveable in any direction this makes relaxing in a z shape almost impossible food was good on the flight from australia they served a variety of australian inspired dishes and on the return more arabic influenced fare crew were quick to respond to drink requests etc decent sized portions as well you dont get a decent amenity kit and it resembles something from economy class with an eye mask ear plugs and thats about it no pjs either however it is really cheap and not that bad for the money spent
18683,south african airways,9,great crew and great food,port elizabeth to london via johannesburg another excellent journey both flights on time both planes almost new with bright cabins great crew and great food saa are a revelation compared to ba
21282,turkmenistan airlines,7,turkmenistan airlines customer review,birmingham to amritsar via ashgabat checkin smooth and flight left on time plane clean and staff could speak enough english to make themselves understood the drinks trolley came around every hour or so but no alcoholic drinks there was no entertainment onboard apart from a map showing where we were landed on time at ashgabat airport the transfer lounge was adequate we waited approx 90 minutes before we continued onto amritsar we sat in the same seats so no new boarding passes were required we arrived on time at amritsar the things i didnt like about this airline were that it was no longer cheap in the uk they have put their prices up by 50 from last year also they dont have life jackets something that petrifies me as i panic when flying one other moan i have is that whenever we hit turbulence and we did quite often there was no announcement telling passengers to return to their seats and put their seat belts on children were playing in the aisles as we went up and down
387,aeroflot russian airlines,1,could not put through their cage,lisbon to hanoi via moscow a ridiculous scene in moscow with a group of staff trying to measure and weigh luggage of passengers i am on business class and have only one backpack and a roller bag only bought two pieces of duty free so the roller bag was expanded and could not put through their cage they refused my boarding and rudely responded to my request to speak to someone i have flown them 6 times over the last 12 months and their cabin services are decent unfortunately their action today was so bad that i would avoid them from now on
5978,breeze airways,1,awful lack of communication,our 5pm flight was delayed due to mechanical issues for a couple of hours the captain gave somewhat frequent updates that a spare plane was coming but delayed due to weather all understandable 34 hours later we get a final update that the spare plane had launched and the crew was going to get some food in the meantime then they all left with their luggage at 930pm we get an email that the flight is delayed until the next day the lone service rep at the desk would either tell you to check the appemails or just walk away they refused to communicate anything over the loudspeaker so fellow passengers were having to yell out updates to each other about new flight times where to find luggage etc we will never fly breeze again due to this awful lack of communication while leaving us stranded and scrambling 6 hours after our flight time
11151,iberia,3,seats were comfortable,iberia is somewhere between average and budget airline seats were comfortable in economy entertainment was great with movies and games there was plenty of overhead space for carry on luggage i saw the crew come through the cabin twice once for each meal the airline cancelled seat assignments at some point but did not refund my 120 i requested kid meals at check in but they did not provide them
21852,virgin australia,8,staff were friendly and helpful,a very enjoyable flight check in was easy there was a slight departure delay staff were friendly and helpful the food served was quite good but it could have been a bit more substantial they also seem to offer the same dishes on their flights desert was a tiny chocolate however the wine served was excellent overall a good flight
7042,china southern airlines,9,professional ground staff,i booked flight tickets from guangzhou to london 4 times with different airlines and all of them were canceled for different reasons its not easy to travel everywhere you want from china in the current situation this was the fifth time i had bought a ticket to london and i was looking forward to my trip but on the morning of the day of the flight i received a call that i would not be able to board the flight due to capacity restrictions at london airport during the following ten hours i was told to wait for the phone call and someone would help me with this problem i was really desperate until my friend suggested i go to the airport directly and ask the ground staff to see if there is a better solution so i arrived at the airport 6 hours before my flight left i talked to the checkin desk manager who talked to me so warm and very kind and my hope was relighted by him after he knew my situation he did not make me wait and just try to help me to find a way to get on the flight he told me that if any other passenger cancel the trip i could take place the seat of the flight as a standby passenger and he kept my phone number and told me he would contact me as long as he get any news half an hour later i went back to his counter and he told me that i was very lucky that a passenger canceled the ticket and i was able to get on the plane then he have done my boarding pass very soon and showed me where to go for security just within 5 minutes i was so appreciative that everything this manager did now i have arrived in london and i am very grateful met such a professional ground staff with his help i saved time and plenty of money to rebook flight tickets
16012,philippine airlines,9,nothing but flawless service,i got onboard this airlines for the first time with very low expectations due to significantly more negative than positive online reviews in the end this turned out to be a pleasant surprise since my experience has shown nothing but flawless service from pr onboard crew service was efficient and fast on both legs pom mnl and mnl cgk sometimes a bit too eager to get rid of your empty plates crew attitude has always been courteous and sincere a321neo with the new business suite configuration pommnl provides a great space and comfort for resting although im not so sure about the blue cloth material choice for the seating that in my opinion only makes the ambiance look more tired than it should have been however the same compliment can not be given to the a321ceo serving mnlcgk with the business class seats that would send you straight back to year 1995 there is only one adjustment button for reclining and zero ife for more than 4hrs flight last time i checked i was not boarding a low cost airlines meals and drinks are great and sufficient options were given for the distance of flight boarding was fast and efficient on both legs with business class priority lane properly executed mabuhay lounge in t2 manila provides great choice for foods service is equally excellent could do with more lazy chairs for long layovers there is a dedicated bartender manning the cocktail bar room for improvement is the rather chaotic check in at pom without any clear priority lane given to business class having said that a local supervisor noticed that i was travelling without checked luggage and immediately sent me to the front of the queue for immediate boarding pass issuance good proactive attitude with so many negative criticisms written about pr i was mentally ready to look for mistakes however i can safely report that it looks like serious improvements have been made by the management to significantly up their game flights on both legs actually arrived earlier than scheduled however this advantage was nullified at naia t2 when the aircraft was forced to wait 1015 minutes prior to parking at the gate only because the aircraft marshal on the ground was not ready to guide the plane to its final parking position
18078,silkair,9,good in flight service,singapore to yogyakarta very comfortable seats only 31 inch pitch but seats are not thick so space between seats seems more than normal good in flight service meal and drinks beer and soft drinks etc but no wine staff are professional and readily assist when needed overall good value and efficient airline
8539,egyptair,6,challenging to get adequate information,i was booked to fly from london to douala via cairo and egyptair did an excellent job to contact me fours days before my flight to inform me the flight was cancelled i was directed to get to the ticketing agent to initiate a process to get a refund it was been challenging to get adequate information from the agent that issued the ticket to me i have made several attempts to to know the next steps to get this sorted out without success i need to get a refund
17693,scoot,9,clean comfortable flight,knowing that the flight was full scoot assigned me and my family seats for free when i was supposed to pay upon checkin i was met by a stern and unfriendly ground staff member and that unfriendliness continued with the ground staff handling the boarding gate they looked depressed pressured and tired as if they hated their job however once on board the team of flight attendants changed the mood of the flight they ensured everyone was well looked after with their positive attitude throughout the flight the seats gave me extra few inches of legroom and were surprisingly comfortable that combined with the a320neos new cabin feel was a perfect recipe for a clean comfortable and awesome flight the inflight entertainment was rich in content and easy to use however being a wifibased entertainment used by many people on the flight the signal strength was incredibly weak that and the lessthangood ground staff team at yogyakarta were the only two things preventing this flight from getting a solid 1010 the landing was around 10 minutes ahead of schedule and the ground staff team in singapore quickly arranged our bags at a special spot thanks to the long immigration queue in singapore lowcost flying can be identic with nofrills yet dismaying service lousy products and paytonsofbucksforeverything on scoot this wasnt the case for me and they truly deserve the awards theyve just obtained
9299,fiji airways,1,has been over 300 days now,i booked my fights in dec 2019 for travel in nov 2020 flights were cancelled in sep 2020 i filled out the fiji online form for my refund of 4350 initially i got a response that it would take 90 days i tried contacting again with the response that i was in the queue and it would be 120 days contacted again no response filled out the online form for status update no response initiated dispute with credit card company and they could do nothing because of the amount of time that had passed it has been over 300 days now
9175,eva air,6,entertainment is not what it used to be,eva airs slogan striving for perfection is a strong strap line yet standards have fallen since covid i have used eva on the london to bangkok route since they started flying from gatwick in 1994 unfortunately my first post covid flight there are a number of issues which need to be addressed the inflight entertainment is not what it used to be with limited choice and a really difficult navigation issue where one has to select ones mood before a small choice appears food was mediocre and the vegetarian bread roll is served cold yet standard fayre comes with a hot roll the evening meal was excellent with fresh salmon and potatoes but my breakfast hash was disgusting
21365,united airlines,3,an epic disappointment,to start off this was my husbands and is first time flying united and it was an epic disappointment we arrive 2 hours early here in birmingham to be told your flight here has been delayed and you will miss your connecting flight in houston to los angeles you have the choice to stay here in birmingham or fly to houston and we will provide a hotel room okay we chose to fly to houston because who knows what could happen we end up in a storm in houston no fault to united airlines but the issue is we lost a day in honolulu and our room there was already paid for no refund issued so we fly 7 12 hours straight to honolulu on a crowded flight having to sit in the middle when our seats were originally by the window so i didnt get the beautiful view of what i wanted to see the food was terrible because we received a salad no dressing and i was thankful we ate dinner the flight back wasnt even better we got delayed in los angeles because the flight attendant was late in honolulu then we go to customer service and they did accommodate us at another hotel with food vouchers however the experience was horrible because most of the staff was rude and disingenuous on how to handle customers things could have been worse but paying for baggage being reseated on every flight was all too much and even with them putting us up in hotels we still lost money and a day in honolulu i say this to say we stayed humble through the experience but it was still not enough to repay for our losses also on the flight home from houston there was no wifi service so that sucked yall ask if i would refer you all to others as a last resort but no
5177,ba cityflyer,8,crew were friendly and efficient,london city to glasgow and a excellent flight overall on time easily dispatched from lcy so much better than lhr plane was clean and comfortable and seemed pretty new crew were friendly and efficient we arrived 10 minutes early and bags available quickly at glasgow all in an excellent experience
21680,vietnam airlines,3,change your flight to the following day,if you are looking for an airlines that will change your flight to the following day without an explanation look no further from other reviews i am seeing online it also looks like it is a common practice for this company i booked a flight tokyo hanoi paris for my return paris hanoi tokyo 18hours they changed the hanoi tokyo flight to 24 hours later it appears normal for vietnam airlines to let me wait at the airport for that time no explanations were made nor any efforts to provide accommodation or any commercial gesture when i reached out to them their response dear mr we regret to inform you that due to vietnam airlines has informed you about schedule change before departure date so we wont compensate in this case when asking if they can assign me a seat with more legroom in the new flight they assigned me we regret to inform that the extra legroom seat applies the fee so we cant support to assign for you via the email please kindly access our website manager booking add ancillaries seat selection to buy the seat when i tried to actually pay to upgrade to premium economy on my longer flight from paris to hanoi because your itinerary has a combination of prices between the 2 itineraries so you cannot upgrade for only flight paris to hanoi if you want to upgrade you need to upgrade all flights paris ha noi narita to business class due to flight ha noi narita dont have premium eco at the bare minimum they did not even offer to pay for a hotel room to avoid me spending one full day waiting at the airport when trying to find another flight for this connection hanoitokyo they suggested to take another flight to ho chi minh and then to tokyo which would save about 6 hours what they did not mention or check is that there was a flight from hanoi to tokyo which arrived in tokyo at the exact same time than what they were suggesting thus saving this unnecessary additional flight in short if you use vietnam airlines be prepared to be left figuring things out on your own when they unilaterally change things their best response will be that they covered themselves because they warned you enough time in advance and if you need to make adjustments pay for it yourself
7023,china southern airlines,9,i had a positive experience,i was impressed with their flight service the flight attendants were friendly and attentive the meals were delicious and there was a good variety of options to choose from the entertainment system was also topnotch with a great selection of movies and tv shows i had a positive experience flying with china southern airlines and would recommend them to others
9913,flysafair,3,shame on you safair for poor service,my mother in law who is 88 years old was booked to go to durban as an assisted passenger at or tambo airport a safair staff member escorted her to the boarding area of the plane when she got to durban she and an elderly couple who were also as assisted passengers waited on board to be helped out the plane this service was not forthcoming by the cabin crew they decided to then disembark by themselves because they were not attended to when my mother in law went to collect her luggage which was supposed to be on carousel 4 it was nowhere to be found she was given the run around on the collection area eventually it was found on carousel 1 imagine a frail 88 year old person trying to take her luggage of the carousel by herself she could have fallen and injured herself she was traumatized and disrespected in this process this could have been prevented if safair cabin crew had done their jobs and escorted her and the other elderly couple of the plane shame on you safair for poor service and disrespecting elderly people wheres your sense of ubunyi
2501,air new zealand,3,not a great experience at all,first time flew with air new zealand on international route not a great experience at all firstly we got tiny earplugs on 12 hours long flight on our way to la couldnt fit at all when asked for the head phones we were told that they were for premium economy which was very surprising as we have been travelled with different airlines too but never had to face this thing before secondly i requested for vegetarian meal and to my surprise half of the container was broken and had a big hole in it with food all exposed and i was served the food in the same condition by staff when i notified staff about it there was no other vegetarian food left on board the flight was late both ways we travelled with our 1 year old baby and other child with this flight but we still have to wait in long queues with others waiting to board whereas other airlines show more courtesy to the families with young kids and ask them to board first that was very disappointing as being national airline but not up to the mark
22293,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,lcybru on fokker 50 very good legroom attentive crew sandwich a beer and a coffee on this short flight i had over 20kg in excess baggage for which vlm decided not to charge their call centre staff are pleasant and efficient and changed the departure date of my flight with minimum fuss and at a reasonable cost

21686,vietnam airlines,9,a nice hot meal for dinner,on this short flight we had a nice hot meal for dinner water and coffee or tea seat pitch was good and friendly crew a terrific job on a fully booked 787
187,aegean airlines,5,aegean did not use to be like that,accurate departure and arrival excellent check in process via the mobile app clean plane the new baggage policy has turned aegean into what i would consider a lowcost carrier booking a flex ticket in order to carry your luggage along with a laptop bag or a purse onboard is unacceptable aegean did not use to be like that it was always a bit more expensive but the passenger was treated well with good cabin service and with the ability to have a carryon and a personal item onboard without having to pay anything extra
18695,south african airways,8,a very pleasant flight,munich to johannesburghaving read some recent reviews about saa on skytrax i was a bit apprehensive about flying saa i booked economy but put in a bid for an upgrade to business and the offer was accepted business class configuration on the older a330200 aircraft looks a bit dated compared to the product on other airlines and newer aircraft but the seat reclined to a 180 degrees flat seat the bedding was comfortable lavatories were cleanthe cabin crew was very attentive four meals options were available with dessert and cheese selections wine selection from selection of south african vinyardsall meals served on porcellan breakfast is a choice of continental full english or fruit salad and cereals cabin lights were dimmed immediately after meal service so that seats could be reclined for sleeping those who wanted breakfast were woken an hour before landing on schedule arrival in jnb all in all a very pleasant flight even if the aircraft used was beginning to feel its age a bit
740,air arabia,5,disappointing experience,you have a great pilots thats the only point where i may put 5 lets start the crews are extremely poorly trained turbulence doesnt give you an excuse to not serve ordered and prepaid lunch or at least to get that poor bottle of water at least do it once landed connected flightdeparting delay for almost an hour crews are chatting laughing no one bothered to explain passengers whats happening unless you ask next the passengers walking standing for almost over an hour and talking loudly to friends or whatever why are the crews quiet again lets go back to prepaid food allowance why the sandwich was served frozen cold and the bottle of water 200ml only oh these delays last year had the same experience plane arriving late for an hour then definitely will depart with delay spoiling passengers mood can you think of those who has short time connecting flight later why cannot you follow the time schedule why shj bus driver giving passengers instruction to leave hand luggage outside the plane under rain my hand luggage bag suiting all the parameters and allowances what was the bus drivers problem with it other luggage i received after a long wait same sharjah flight was full of water inside and arrived unwrapped cant imagine how did they kept throwing it as all new bottled stuff has been opened absolutely every single tube opened and leaked out all the liquids that wifi even didnt work 500 ticket disappointing experience
22836,wow air,4,a horrible first impression,on december 29th 2018 a friend and i were flying from newark to keflavk we didnt hear the calls to board and lost track of time while we were eating we admit fault to this when we realized our flight was boarding we ran to the gate they representatives at the gate were the nastiest ive ever seen they were talking to us like we were stupid for an honest mistake they were making us feel so bad telling us how everyone was waiting for us which clearly we felt bad about enough and how selfish we were even threatening to not let us get on the flight when i snapped back at one of them first of all we knew we messed up but as a customer service representative it isnt your job to scold us like were children it was a horrible first impression of the airline
10951,hawaiian airlines,3,destroyed its customer service credibility,while staff are generally friendly on board hawaiian airlines flights customer service for anything not in person is unforgivingly terrible you will spend hours to get the most basic support like rescheduling a ticket there call center lines occasionally out source to some foreign countries with people who barely speak english and its very disappointing hawaiian for then last decade used to be my preferred airlines but with the death of island air and corporate greed caused by covid youre better off flying delta or southwest very disappointed with how this company has destroyed its customer service credibility over a few thousand dollars corporate greed at its finest
21871,virgin australia,7,service was friendly and very helpful,an enjoyable flight easy and friendly check in the plane left on time service was friendly and very helpful the food was limited just tea coffee and water with snacks to purchase but that is no problem given that it was a short flight
5357,bangkok airways,9,efficient friendly and professional,travelling with bangkok airways for an hours flight from yangon to bangkok seemed to be a short time for the crew to prepare the plane for their passengers but consistently they have managed to keep the plane clean freshsmelling and for such a short flight they served a hot meal which is good enough to keep one satiated until the plane arrives in suvarnabhumi airport the fas are efficient friendly and professional just a slight comment on food served both on outbound and inbound flights as i have an allergy to seafood i was surprised that i was served shrimp with noodles then on the way back shrimp with rice i would have appreciated if they had served chicken instead which is a safer option in case certain passengers have dietary restrictions i know i had the choice to refuse the meal being served but i was hungry as i came straight from the office to make my 3pm flight ground staff both in yangon and bangkok are all pleasant helpful and smiled as they carried on with their work the way they treated their passengers before boarding somehow translated to how they all behaved orderly fashion during the boarding process all in all another good service from bangkok airways both on the ground on in flight
6454,caribbean airlines,2,the worst experience i have had,i have been flying to jamaica for years and this flight has been the worst experience i have had my flight from kingston back to new york was supposed to take off at 730pm on september 02 i checked in around 5pm and i was told the flight was delayed i sat in my seat for another two hours only to hear from a vendor in airport that my flight was canceled it was not announced to us and i sat there thinking i was going home that night i went to the information desk and then they finally told me that the flight was canceled and i have a choice of going to a hotel or going back to where i was staying they didnt have any information about when the next flight would be or what was the cause for it to be canceled around after one the next morning i received a call letting me know that they have a flight at 630am i checked in around 5am and once again my flight was delayed i board the plane after 7am and my plane did not take off till 9am that morning my overall experience with caribbean airlines was a disgrace this is not an experience that i would like to deal with again
8317,easyjet,7,good transport to get from point a to point b,it is a low cost company and the review must me written according to the services they offer very bad support on the ground team was afraid my suitcase did not arrive a bit confusing boarding lots of time stranded in the access to the plane overall a good transport to get from point a to point b
11435,insel air,1,delays were not communicated,curacao to bonaire with insel air original flight time 910 am 930 am we chose it so we could get enough sleep and still be at our destination early enough to go scuba diving that day 2 days prior to departure we were informed by email that our departure time was changed to an earlier hour ie to 715 am since insel air asks you to be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure we got up at 430 am in the morning there was no request to confirm that you had received said email as soon as we arrived at the gate in the airport we were informed that the flight was delayed from 715 am to 845 am we were quite annoyed because that meant we could have just as well slept long enough after waiting for an hour we were informed that the new departure time was now 0940 am we were also informed that the 0715 flight was cancelled and everybody was simply booked onto the next regular flight everybody got an 8 snack voucher until then the communication at the gate had been relatively professional every delay was displayed on the gate monitor from now on however no more communication departure gate was changed from gate 2 to 6 but until departure it was never shown on the gate monitors we had to follow the crowd to find our new gate all additional delays were not communicated in any way at 0945 am still no boarding when we asked at the gate we were informed that there was an additional delay and departure time was now scheduled for 1015 am at 1015 am we were not boarded boarding finally started at 1020 am departure around 1040 am arrival around 1100 am on the plane we were told that all seat reservations were cancelled and that everybody should just sit down wherever they wanted we were lucky to be early so we could still find 2 adjacent seats after arrival at bonaire airport we were shocked to learn that there had been no luggage at all loaded into the plane insel air somehow managed to fly about 100 passengers but left all of their luggage in curacao there was now a long queue in front of the lost baggage counter when we were up our boarding pass number was written down on a piece of paper nothing more when we asked about the further proceedings we were informed that the luggage could not be brought to our hotel instead we would have to come back to the airport and pick it up they could not tell us at what time that would be possible and only after repeatedly asking they wrote down our phone number and promised to call us when the luggage was there to pick up they never called after not hearing anything from insel air we drove to the airport at 1500 pm and luckily it was there
12990,korean air,5,overall poor customer service,hong kong to shenyang via seoul korean air has recently introduced a ridiculous policy of not allowing online or appbased seat changes even for biz class unless you are a member of their program their response is it is a security issue but it seems they just want to collect even more information than they already have and discourage your use of your other program membership i am an elite skyteam member via delta and all i want to do is change my seat this is both pre and during online checkin really doesnt make sense thousands paid for the ticket and i cant even choose the seat i want very disappointing but inline with the overall poor customer service performance i am accustomed to receiving on korean air i am not sure if they truly understand the concept of alliances and the purpose of sticking with an alliance like skyteam they really need to consider this poor service with their customers
15718,pal express,4,pal express customer review,manilacaticlan did web checkin and when we got to the airline counter we were informed that the flight was delayed 2 hours while checking the departures screen i noticed that our original flight number was different from the flight no in our boarding pass but the time remained the same confusion when asked for an explanation we realised that not only was our flight delayed we were bumped off for a later flight also delayed therefore the times in our boarding pass were all wrong no explanation was given only that they tried to contact us which was not true i had my cell phone with me and i checked my email often all in all a miserable experience makes you want to just stay home
10235,garuda indonesia,8,the crew welcomed us warmly,flying garuda indonesia on a shorthaul flight along with my wife and 8months old son in economy class it was a busy sunday afternoon in adi sucipto airport but the ground staff processed our check in with genuine hospitality on board the crew welcomed us warmly engaged with my son and consistently demonstrated helpfulness and friendliness despite the flight being full both in business and economy class the snack served in economy class was two breads a pack of nuts and a bottle of mineral water garuda has added to capacity in some of its economy class planes making the seat pitch and leg room less narrower and for me personally less comfortable the flight could also have been more enjoyable if garuda added more movie selection in its inflight entertainment system the flight departed and landed on time we appreciated garuda for bringing us back to jakarta safely
2191,air malta,4,air malta customer review,flew amsterdam to malta i always try to avoid air malta if possible unfortunately sometimes i do not succeed i prefer an indirect flight instead of a direct air malta flight air malta is not cheap but has bad service unfriendly staff bad spread of seats very expensive additional luggage fee poor food legspace very limited and no internet check in try to avoid if possible

2465,air namibia,8,air namibia customer review,frawdhjhb return the main reason for choosing air namibia was their low price and for us convenient flight dates online check in worked pretty good and we could choose our seat for the intercontinental flights planes were in good condition seats a bit old and not too comfortable entertainment was pretty bad just a few screens for all passengers with horrible quality and uninteresting videos cabin crew was okay some of them more friendly and helpful than others same with the food nothing special but nothing wrong with it either overall my experience was quite good you get what you pay for they dont excel at anything but nothing is very bad either

18348,sky airline,6,seat pitch better than expected,buenos aires to lima via santiago de chile their web page is not fully functional in english and booking does not go smooth all the time as some reviewers already wrote i was booking two separate tickets for two different flights and one payment was not accepted but i got confirmation number to avoid being charged multiple times i used both contact form and provided email contact to ask about payment but never got an answer after checking with card provider that card was not charged i bought ticket for the other flight few days later payment was accepted and confirmation mail sent with the new booking number online check in is available 2 days and 3h in advance and boarding passes need to be printed and presented during baggage drop off luggage drop off was done at normal check in counter 23kg hold luggage is included in ticket price planes are boarded from the last row and it was well organised both flights were full planes are in fine condition and clean there are ads in the cabin but not too many seat pitch was better than expected and i had enough space even on longer flight to lima which is 3h30m long buy on board have few options and is affordably priced pesos and u are only accepted fas were well groomed and professional there was no selling of lottery and similar things flight deck gave info about the flights and bridges were used all the time for boarding and disembarking both flights left and arrived on time few days after the first flight feedback survey was sent and it was in spanish no option to choose englis messy web page problematic booking and lack of communication after pushed down the airport and flight experience which could be described as good as any european short haul experience legacy or lcc
17033,royal brunei airlines,9,the best deal on the market,i have found royal brunei to be a very comfortable airline to fly with the food is of a good standard just as any other airline yes no alcohol but that is ok plenty of refreshments offered throughout the flight movies were good not much at brunei departure lounge but hopefully will improve with upgrades going on most of all the price offered by royal brunei is truly the best deal on the market flying from new zealand to london for 1630 return
10315,georgian airways,5,would also not recommend,service inconsistency flying two legs with georgian airways from prague to tbilisi and from tbilisi to moscow cabin crew was very efficient and pleasant we were served a very good food overall a very pleasant experience unfortunately flight from tbilisi to moscow on boeing 737700 was very different nowhere close to the previous flight i felt this must be a different company food was absolutely terrible cabin crew was mostly invisible the plane was also old and not very clean given the service inconsistency i would hesitate to use georgian airways again and would also not recommend
664,aigle azur,1,worst experience ever,beirut to paris worst experience ever i booked online a two way ticket for a very tight scheduled business flight and after taking the money from my bank account a few days later i received a notification that the return flight was rescheduled to two days later which does not suite me although tickets offerings for the same date were still available on many sites online a couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled i was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund upon choosing the full refund i got back less than 40 of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable the funniest thing is that the cancelled flight was charged much less than the outbound flight and this was the only amount subject to full refund i never recommend aigle azur i rate this act as a sort of phishing they lie to you about cheap available flights and then reschedule it based on their interest so you will be the only and major loser for cancelling if the rescheduling does not suite you
10352,germania airline,8,service was quite good,tel aviv to hamburg with germania for a low cost no frills airline service was quite good standard seats reasonably comfortable aircraft looked new in flight entertainment limited to 1 movie and you have to pay for earphones or bring your own my standard earphones were not compatible with the system same movie inbound and outbound from overhead screens a socalled meal was served which was a vegetarian pasta dish overloaded with basil not a real substitue for lunch but soft drinks were continuously offered overall a pleasant flight they have a 6kg weight limit for carryon baggage which wasnt checked outbound from tlv but was checked at hamburg where only one checkin counter was operating seats do not recline

14119,lufthansa,8,service onboard was friendly,european short haul business class can not be compared with international the seating is very different normal standard class seats with a spare seat in the centre however for this short flight it was adequate service onboard was friendly if a little mechanical food served was pretty nice with very tender beef with mashed celeriac and a chocolate pudding and delicious bread roll and butter a wide choice of drinks were offered wine beer soft drinks tea coffee etc the flight attendant came around several times on this short flight offering further drinks and tidying up we also received the very tasty lufthansa branded chocolate
15764,peach aviation,9,extremely short flight and worth the money,weekend getaway to osaka extremely short flight and worth the money with cabin cleanliness and excellent crews our 840 pm flight departed late usually does as it did in the past so a front row seat prebooking is recommended the airport is empty at this time upon arrival but a front seat ensures no queue we landed at 1045 and made it to our bus at 11 with time to go to the bathroom use the atm and get some water any further behind and you wait another hour for the bus on our return flight to incheon complimentary exit row seats were orovided at the check in counter kiosk didnt complete check in without even asking
7366,condor airlines,8,plane fresh and clean,plane is new seats are comfortable and i rode premium economy i would say the window seat there is a gap between seat and bulkhead like a bottomless pit do things do fall into it condor made clear that upgrades only apply to their airline and not other feeder airline plane fresh and clean service adequate money was 500 less than delta the having to get the follow up boarding pass is confusing i was chosen for additional screening along with 4 other male passengers i thought that was a bit odd
19878,tap portugal,4,a total lack of transparency,will not fly with tap portugal again the problem was with hidden or added costs and a total lack of transparency when checking in we were not given the option to choose our seats at all there were seats already assigned to us and of course those were most uncomfortable and the option to upgrade them for 55 was there with the almost whole plane empty and available as it seemed which was ridiculous i have never happened upon the situation when one has preassigned seats and no option to choose from what is available a nice way to add a cost of 50 for a completely regular seat then came the baggage apparently we had to pay another 105 to check in one single notoverweight in any way bag never ever happened to me before every airline includes one bag in its ticket price every single one i flew with ever and those were regular tickets not discounted or last minute deals or any deals at all just regular tickets purchased 3 months ahead at a full price so in the end a flight a round trip from tel aviv to cancun cost not 940 each ticket as paid while ordering the flight but with 55 to choose a seat each way and 105 for a baggage each way it came to 1240 1240 instead 940 let it sink in if i knew this was the actual cost i of course would not have ordered the tickets through this particular airline at all and of course i will not order any tickets through them again
17848,shandong airlines,7,shandong airlines customer review,pektna return first time flying shandong codeshare with air china i found it an efficient airline offering good value for the money plane was a new 737800 cabin was clean seat pitch was ok 34 inches or so flight attendants were polite and attentive and the flights left and arrived on time shandongs onboard service is fairly basic bottle of water and foil wrapped sandwich but not out of the ordinary for a one hour flight
16117,play,5,the seats are not comfortable,the trip was okay and the flight on time they need to service food or at least soda or water in the plane the seats are not comfortable
23034,xl airways france,7,pay for extra legroom seat,flew new york jfk to paris cdg in may 2015 i would fly them again but take my advice and pay the extra 50 for an extra legroom seat for the amount of money you save by flying xl airways over the competitors the 50 is a worthy splurge both flights were on time fare was a steal at 700 i havent seen anything this cheap in years staff was extremely professional both in flight and gate staff plane was in good condition tiny seats i am 53 and didnt have too much problem however my boyfriend is 60 and was miserable the passenger in front reclined his seat and was basically sitting in my boyfriends lap for 7 hours their website is horrible after the first leg of my trip i wised up and was trying to reserve extra legroom seats on the website but kept getting error messages and ultimately was not able to this was absolutely infuriating after all those errors on the website i tried to call their customer service for help but only got voicemail absolutely infuriating good luck if you need any help after you book no inflight entertainment the power outlet at our seats worked only intermittently make every effort to charge your devices before boarding the plane
20947,tui airways,4,not impressed with tui,to be fair i dont know whether this is partly an airport fault we were booked on a flight due for take off at 250pm the airport board said check in opened 1220 we joined the queue at 1215 check in did not start until 1230 and then only one desk not two for another few minutes at the departure lounge the board said gate displayed 215 at 215 we went to gate 1 which we had been advised of by special assistance i have a problem with steps so required the lift to the plane when the flight was announced we were taken to the lift which has comfy seats fortunately we could see the other passengers queuing in the cold wind and gathering clouds at 230 the fueller was still operating the special assistance guy looked in the cabin through the window tried the emergency door but there was no response at first we could see the cockpit crew in the plane all i can assume is that cleaning took longer than usual given that the flight was supposed to take off at 250 the delay in boarding seems odd but then so does fuelling when the plane had been standing for about an hour and the airport was anything but busy eventually about 240 the cabin crew opened the door and we were allowed entry the plane was beautifully clean the cabin crew were smiley and friendly but how those poor people with toddlers and babies who had been standing in the cold were feeling i have no idea incidentally the stance tui uses is quite a walk from the terminal and only part of it is under cover given the inclement weather conditions in aberdeen generally its unfortunate to say the least ba has covered airbridges from the terminal for its flights maybe its a cost thing for tui the pilot announced something about possibly missing our slot worst case scenario half hour wait we either were allowed to go late or stole another flights slot but took off fairly quickly however both hubby and myself noticed excessive air pressure change on take off and landing of this flight its not something weve noticed before i cant say it was a different aircraft it looked like any other just not impressed with tui this time around it has always been my flight provider of choice but i maybe need to think again
7595,corendon airlines,2,corendon airlines customer review,amsercanams flights to ecn do not fly direct but via antalya aty due to international flying regulations to n cyprus old b738 cabin full of young holiday makers chaotic boarding and dismemberment no clear instructions to passengers on landing at aty halfhour after landing crew announces passengers to disembark and change to a sister plane on return at around 1am captain announces problems with wheel during landing at aty passengers ferried to transit lounge waiting for plane to be repaired resume journey 90 min later no announcements made in english except some dutch and local language not even at aty airport fa totally unprofessional and rude especially on the return flight aircrafts old cramped soiled seating cabin lights blinking badly maintained aircrafts no ife food expensive and of low quality not recommended will never fly corendon

10340,germania airline,7,crew was very friendly,dusseldorf to sharm el sheikh i checked in at 615 in the morning and the line was already very long there were two check in counters for the flight but only one was open it took nearly half an hour until the second staff member came and opened the second counter when i got to the counter to check myself in the check in staff informed me that the aircraft type had changed and that the seat that i had paid extra for was not available anymore as it did not exist on this aircraft type an a319 was the original planned aircraft but a a321 was actually being used for this flight so i told the staff member to provide me with a similar seat somewhere else on the aircraft according to her she gave me a seat with extra legroom as i am over 2 meters tall that is what i always need and that is what i had paid for when i got onto the aircraft she had assigned me a normal seat not an extra legroom seat luckily the plane was only half full and therefore the crew changed me on a extra legroom seat straight away as i could proof that that is what i already had paid for the crew was very friendly and caring the plane arrived on time and i received my luggage very quickly as well
7286,cobalt,2,after 2 months nothing had been changed,tel aviv to larnaca i made a mistake with my wife first name when i did my order through ticket broker site i called cobalt representative to correct my mistake the worker told me that it corrected and i need to call the agency that i did through them the reservation because they need to draw revised data from cobalt i called my ticket broker site and they told me that they didnt see any email from cobalt i called again to cobalt representative that told me again that now the name is correct and i need to call again the agency this circle has been done at least 6 times and still after 2 months nothing had been changed

23042,xl airways france,9,seats standard size and comfortable,we were apprehensive having looked at unfavourable xl airways france reviews this was a roundtrip flight new yorkparis both flights were on time we are not small people the seats which we paid extra for were standard size and comfortable the food was airline food but above average for its class and they offered seconds of rolls the downsides you cant check in online and they dont offer accommodations for handicapped or seniors until youve checked in so if thats your situation be warned we got to the airport the customary 253 hrs ahead of boarding and had no problems though you have to email for the seat upgrade its not possible online the video entertainment on central screens looked really awful but it didnt matter to us
11356,icelandair,2,one of my worst airline experiences,this was one of my worst airline experiences after delaying my flight out of lgw by 4 hours and being promised by customer service agents that it would not be a problem and they would figure out an easy solution for me when i arrived in kef they delayed my connection but not enough for me to make my flight there were only a couple other flights going to the us the rest of the night that were already overbooked because they had done the same thing to another flight that day my only option was to be put in a hotel and take a flight 24 hours later after finally arriving to the hotel i was supposed to stay in the hotel informed us that they had run out of rooms and would transport us to a separate hotel not one icelandair employee apologized or admitted that maybe they should not have reassured me many times that everything would be fine and i would be able to continue on to my final destination
9196,eva air,5,no hot beverage service,taipei to seoul disappointing flight not busy but plane is old hello kitty plane no hot beverage service or drinks just given a bag with cake and water inside not really sure why cabin crew average poor business class offering on this flight
905,air astana,5,good service and great tasting food,almaty to kuala lumpur my final destination was jakarta but air astana could only check in my luggage until kuala lumpur as there was no facility to check in to another airline the flight was delayed more than 3 hours from almaty original departure time was 1130pm it was not until 250am we boarded and left for kul during this time the flight time was changed at least 3 times from 1130pm 2am 230am and 240am there was no apology or information provided other than for technical reasons due to the delay i missed my connecting flight to jakarta the product flat bed is only 140 degree at the best it is an old style low bed where you almost sleep on the floor a 10 inch ipad was provided as an alternate to ptv the movie selections are limited and nothing to rave about the positive no crowd in business class great duvet and blankets good service and great tasting food
9392,finnair,9,perfect flying experience,perfect flying experience after horrible years of budget airlines loved the plane from helsinki to london nice staff and made whole day less stressful will definitely fly again also no problem with connecting flight easy transfer in helsinki
8657,ellinair,1,immaculate and smiling crew,very pleasant flight from athens to thessaloniki with ellinair easy process of booking and echeck in the boarding pass is sent to the mobile so no app or printer is needed athens airport was a breeze the fee included checked baggage so i chose to check in my hand luggage also for free the company did it with a smile departure and arrival on time flight about 60 full good legspace service included very small snack and drinks immaculate and smiling crew quick retrieval of baggage in thessaloniki excellent experience
18703,south african airways,4,there are no snacks on board,cape town to london via johannesburg i will start with a few positives about the experience the staff are personable and the meal service is conducted quickly to allow the maximum sleep time on the jnblhr route access is provided to an arrivals lounge which is essential as the airlines serves only powdered coffee now for the many negatives these relate primarily to the seat and to the airlines schedule instability the aircraft was the advertised a330200 these are widely marketed as lieflats by the airline and independent websites however they are angled at about 170 deg and uncomfortable for sleeping saa is rare in having a different business class seating product on each longhaul aircraft type and also unusual to go from the extremely comfortable and 2metre long long lieflats on the a340600 back to an angled version the schedule is unstable i was booked on sa354 at 1705 saa did not inform either my travel agent or me of the change in flight plans it was only by chance that i had wifi access and attempted an online checkin to notice we had been rebooked on sa346 at 1500 this flight operates 2 hours earlier than our original booking for much of our trip we were in the bush and off grid so would have missed the flight if we had been coming from elsewhere this lack of communication of a significant flight change is terrible as we would have missed the flight had we turned up for a 1705 departure on checkin it became apparent that the sa352 at 1605 was cancelled and passengers being moved from sa352 to sa354 however a 5hour wait at jnb was not expected or particularly welcome and no attempt was made to move us to the earlier sa234 from jnb to lhr staff professionalism staff chatted in the galleys throughout the night on both lhr flights which disrupted sleep despite ear plugs furthermore my request if a snack might be available before the breakfast service commenced only to be told there are no snacks on board other airlines on similar flight lengths would at the very least be able to offer a pack of nuts or crackers
3232,airasia india,6,most congested seating configuration i found in india,another lcc in india subsidiary of airasia service was ok on time boarding and departure and so was arrival cabin crew were courteous but with respect to any other airline in india it has the least legroom most congested seating configuration i found in india this is one reason which makes me rethink before booking next flight with them
1724,air france,7,i would fly air france again,the plane was nice ife was pretty good the main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag the staff in the plane from chicago to paris was not very friendly the staff in the way back from paris to chicago was very kind and helpful big difference lastly my checked bag didnt make it to chicago the staff at chicago didnt really want to help me one spent a few moments trying to register a claim gave up handed me a card with instructions and walked away i tried someone else about 15 minutes later while she was not happy to help she did complete the claim for me which i appreciated the bag was delivered to my door 200 miles from the airport the next day was was great i would fly air france again
6144,brussels airlines,9,crew was very friendly,when i saw the airplane with the painting on the plane i was surprised and i love it brussels airlines have a few aircraft painted in a different theme the boarding was on time also we landed on time the plane was really clean seats comfortable the crew was very friendly only i was a negative surprise that for this 2 hours flight we have to buy even water but ok that a lot of airlines do that overall i was a positive surprise with a friendly crew and a nice flight
7193,cityjet,8,attendants were professional,i flew cityjet from amsterdam schiphol to london city the flight was fully booked and the ground crew suggested at the gate to have our carry on luggages loaded into the baggage compartments because the overhead bin wouldnt be able to accommodate all luggages of the passengers very well solved by the crew the flight was pretty much an uneventful meaning no delay and smooth the flight attendants were professional distributed the refreshments and snacks within the short flight time and did the clean up afterwards 45 minutes of air time leg room is more than decent and very comfortable seats this aircraft is still equipped with the old style seats almost like a sofa very soft and comfortable
23169,zipair,6,it was immaculately clean,zipair is jals budget airline they dont have classes of travel you just pick your seat flat bed emergency exit etc and pay accordingly we usually travel ba or jal business class this trip was last minute and jal business was going to cost 8k instead we paid just over 25k to fly with zipair in their fully flat seats your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage and they do weigh rucksackshandbags etc a bottle of water and the seat you booked check in process was not good of course we arent used to queuing for check in but here everyone queues there is no advanced passenger information loaded so with covid added the check in process was long also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold you can pay to add a bag to the hold but you cant pay for additional cabin baggage they are strict on weight to the gram we were also asked if we had a return ticket which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2 in fact i was sat behind and to the right of my husband this was pointed out to us at checkin but we werent allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin seats must be booked at least 24 hours before checkin and again this is enforced strictly we couldnt even change seats on board although the seat on my husbands left was free the fully flat bed was nearly as good as jalba business class not quite so much storage includes reading light table and some storage space you can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for takeoff and landing an improvement on the new ba business class seats its quite hard but otherwise good it was immaculately clean again better than ba cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe there is no entertainment screen wifi is included free of charge and a very small selection of films is available the fully flat seat has a usb charging point fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and qi code the onboard shop opens about an hour after takeoff and closes about an hour before landing otherwise meals must be booked in advance prebooked meals are served before the onboard shop is open so you cant buy a drink until after your meal cushions and blankets are not included but can be bought from the online shop in deciding whether to use zipair you need to compare cost to convenience if you have time to download movies book seats in advance there is no app to make this easy preorder meals and to bring your own pre and withmeal drinks that will help also to bring your own cushionblanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board for me some of the joy was missing there wasnt enough mealentertainmentshopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping is that worth 55k only you can answer that
22583,vueling airlines,3,compensation was declined,ive flown with vueling twice as long as there are no issues theyre fine but once the plane was over 4h late and i tried to get in touch with the airline to get compensation as i missed my train and had to pay for a hotel night in paris it was impossible to get a hold of anybody and my request for compensation was declined so as long as you dont have to get in touch with them its fine but if something goes wrong youre screwed
9461,finnair,1,worst airline service,vberlin to delhi via helsinki 10 hours before 9pm my journey i test positive for covid 19 so like any reasonable human being i contact all my close contacts about the same since finnair customer care is anyway not open post 8pm in germany the next day i contacted finnair about my situation and that i have missed my flight due to covid requesting a reschedule of my onward journey the quote they propose for the new onward journey seemed a bit high as there were better options that flew directly to my desired destination thus i suggested them to just keep my return journey from delhi to berlin they do not reply to my email for a day and the next day informed me that since i missed my onward journey now my return journey is also cancelled a journey which i had paid to upgrade from economy to business the customer service is extremely rude and has no sense of empathy the entire airline operates without a sense of caring about their guests and is just looking to scam the customer in its operating methods i would highly suggest anyone to not fly this airline you will be better off with the middle eastern carriers always because they always at least care about their guests the customer service at finnair is coldhearted with no empathy towards their guests health if you book your ticket from an agent then this is probably the worst airline service that i have encountered to date as they simply tend to pass the buck on the agent a behaviour that i have never seen with other flag carriers like af sq ey or qt
11958,jeju air,2,try and avoid this company,macau to seoul as a long holiday trip around asia i dont make airline reviews a lot but i must do it for jeju air because of its terrible customer service ever seen starting from a long check in with only some jeju air customer representative are visible at macau airport our flight was delay with no explanation from the airport which was making itself a 2 hour delay as jeju air is a budget airline you must pay for everything including changing seat but then we boarded an old plane for an uncomfortable 3 hours and 30 minutes flight to south korea overall for this flight include seat was broken legroom uncomfortable no free food and drinks and nothing the only positive thing was their onboard staff which was friendly but please try and avoid this company to avoid disappointment and fly an alternative airline if possible
5038,avianca,2,the service is very bad,avianca is a low cost airline with normal carrier ticket prices the service is very bad not even water in 5 hour flight they change class of ticket without reimbursement
19817,tap portugal,8,a very chaotic boarding,plane left late we had to take the bus to a very remote stand we were closed in a bus filled with people before entering the plane for more then 10 minutes boarding was very long and people were not well managed in all a very chaotic boarding developed in a smooth flight experience
18566,smartwings,8,crew professional and efficient,marsa alam to prague aircraft was clean and looked new despite age departed on time a small hot meal and drinks service was provided cabin crew professional and efficient seats proved hard after 3 or 4 hours but were bearable we were warned in advance of a rough approach to prague due to very strong winds in reality this was the worst i have experienced in many flights but the flight crew handled it brilliantly
21428,ural airlines,3,ural airlines customer review,dmesvx check in quick at moscow although i did arrive early and was surprised to find the checkin already open pleasantly surprised to find we were flying on a boeing 737 rather than an old russian aircraft service and aircrew nothing out of the ordinary but polite and courteous cold meal provided even though the flight is only 2 hours again a typical eastern european meal not to everybodys liking but filled a hole when arriving late at night
19966,thai airasia,1,excellent experience,bangkok to siem reap quick on time and served an excellent curry meal the flight was barely 50ish minutes i was in conversation with a fellow passenger and surprised that i got a meal very tasty btw and that we were actually landing excellent experience with checking an extra bag arrived quickly and in good order absolutely nothing to complain about and recommended
15359,olympic air,2,not recommend this airline,i had my flight booked in the evening at 2300 from chania to athens due to unforseen circumstances my partner had to leave earlier in the morning to a different destination i was at chania airport from 11am for that reason and i asked at the olympic air desk about availability of earlier flights instead of waiting alone till 11pm at the airport i found the staff very unhelpful reporting that there are seats left at the 1800 flight but i have to pay 60 euros extra fee for the change of flight i was expecting a little bit more understanding especially since they saw me standing there all day in front of them until 5pm i value kindness and morality above money but clearly this is not the case for this company i would not recommend this airline for that reason
16558,qatar airways,9,will keep flying qatar,i flew with qatar to hkt via doh return via bkkdohams using economy class on the ams to doh segment and business class on the doh to hkt segment new interior with plenty of legroom in economy and good service on the ground and in the air old business class on the doha to phuket segment but still very good with a very nice amenity kit and pyamas provided return via bkk all segments in economy was also good with a seamless transfer process in doha will keep flying qatar
16629,qatar airways,5,extremely old a330300,the planes from athens to doha and back were extremely old a330300 seat space is limited if you take a window seat there is a metal box in front of you no wifi no usb lcd screen has limited brightness contrast entertainment full of 2nd class movies and series doha airport lounge access is extremely expensive and restricted which offered only 2 different dishes impossible to find a proper place to relax only good option was the shower available i tried to add the cheaper lounge before my flight but was not allowed because you have to do that 48 hours before the flight toilets are quite limited i had to wait in line for 10 min for a toilet booth boarding was organized chaos in all 4 flights especially the last one from doha to athens where we had to had to use buses wait in line for a bus to arrive and delayed departure because of that check in was ok in athens very slow in bangkok had to wait 40 min in line food and service was fine in all flights but nothing spectacular for example no sparkling water wifi was advertised in the flight from doha to bangkok but it worked only from bangkok to doha in all a pretty average to poor experience
18226,singapore airlines,9,really nice for a sub 2hour flight,the silver kris lounge at sin t3 was big and nice however finding good seating during peak time was still challenging the lounge offered good selection of food including western chinese and local options the flight was on sq regional a350900 which has similar flatbed seats as other premium airlines longhaul equipment that was really nice for a sub 2hour flight inflight food service was very nice for such a short flight

3849,alaska airlines,2,worst airline ive ever experienced,the absolute worst airline ive ever flown with first our flight leaving cleveland left an hour late for the pilot not showing up then as we were about to land and go to our connecting flight they cancelled we then waited 6 hours on seattle airport to reschedule my 4 year had to sleep on the cold floor no water or food and drink places open at that hour a news crews even talked to us after seeing him shivering sleeping on the floor the airline then rescheduled us for the following night and that flight is now delayed 3 hours and climbing from having no crew very unreliable worst airline ive ever experienced i will never fly or recommend this airline to anyone ever again almost 3000 people stranded in seattle solely for this airline due to their own fault on christmas day
11036,hong kong airlines,4,brought my wife and i one blanket,i caught a redeye flight from bali to taipei via hong kong i had to ask four flight attendants over a period of 10 to 15 minutes before i received a blanket one flight attendant brought my wife and i one blanket but we clearly asked for two we held up two fingers when we requested the blankets she later gave two blankets to a couple several rows in front of us i had to ask another flight attendant the fourth to get a blanket most people use a blanket on redeye flights so i cant see why they were not stowed in the seat pockets as i have experienced with other airlines
15001,niki,5,nikis service is not that good,niki is no low cost airline anymore if it ever was one flights between large european cities cost up to 100 and more also my flight from vie to fco was not cheap but nikis service is not that good the only thing niki offers you compared to other airlines is a cold and ugly sandwich plus a soft drink but it is not worth the price however the ground staff which in fact were staff from the airport were experienced and friendly despite that the cabin crew was unkind and sloppy and their englishskills had been disastrous the ife was made up of a safety video and a map not more
20831,transavia,5,wouldnt let us do priority boarding,we always get priority boarding in airports we have been no matter what we book because we travel with a baby under 2 years old but at rotterdam airport they wouldnt let us do priority boarding and we were pushed away also no help on board with the baby either

23082,xl airways france,6,xl airways france customer review,xl airways france flies twice a week between paris and las vegas the flights are cheap a bit over 1800 for galaxie class 700 for economy both roundtrip separate lines for galaxie class made checkin a breeze boarding was quick in las vegas a mess in paris seats in the small galaxie class section 27 of them on a330 were about what one would expect on a domestic aa or ua flight meals were decent and beverages were available throughout the flights cabin crew were friendly and helpful
12704,karthago airlines,8,karthago airlines customer review,opomir return cabin crew friendly breakfast served it was nothing special but not bad for plane food there was no entertainment onboard but the planes were clean
6093,british airways,5,premium price for very average service,regarding the aircraft and seat the business class seats on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple its quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging ports the seat is pretty comfortable as someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights this was one of the only times ive been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and dont provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wifi in business class is not acceptable another example of bas penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast wasnt much better summary ba has become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other options available i would choose them over ba these days
1095,air botswana,8,air botswana customer review,francistown johannesburg 16 september good short flight efficiently run with good crew on time and no problems
22877,wow air,7,a competitive price,keflavik to baltimore long flight with comfortable seats and basic services no entertainment system easy short transit in kef wish it were longer since there were lots of food and shopping outlets that looked good i did manage to have a quick meal because i didnt preorder an inflight meal and purchased local chocolate highly recommend flight attendants should make more effort to smile i thought this was a competitive price for a last minute purchase
10722,gulf air,3,system showed all seats were reserved,gulf airs online checkin system showed all seats were reserved except those that a passenger needs to pay for i paid 20 to reserve a seat but when i boarded the plane it was almost empty gulf air staff told me to contact customer services if i wanted a refund i did and they keep sending me a automated reference number and a message saying we will contact you soon it has been over a month now and i have had no explanation the flight experience was poor too
2944,air tahiti nui,4,air tahiti nui customer review,flew lax to ppt and back for an oceania cruise going to ppt things were just ok after all you are heading to paradise so its easier to overlook less than friendly service uncomfortable seats and marginal food our return flight was a charter arranged by the cruise line and things were much worse they had little or no ice limited beverage options and the food was awful the flight attendants just dont have any spark to them some of that may be a cultural thing because i find customer service in fp to be less warm and inviting than in europe or the us this airline needs to really punch up their customer service
14529,malindo air,1,over a year later no refund,my flight was cancelled i was offered a voucher but declined they dont fly enough routes id want to use eventually they agreed to a refund after many emails since then ive chased every month i keep being told its being passed to another department for payment but over a year later no refund
18424,sky express airlines,2,baggage had to be 15kg,athens to santorini terrible airline disorganized check in took an hour not advised that baggage had to be 15kg we were 23kg over and charged 56 euros i have checked their website which says 5 euro per kg not 8 euro sat on the tarmac for 1 hr in the heat just as hot for the trip poor aircon on the plane
10982,hi fly,2,terrible experience never again,los angeles to london gatwick terrible experience never again originally booked with norwegian but received text message stating our flight was being operated by hi fly we had the economy plus allowing us to check bags seats were pre assigned and meals included no overhead air vents and the flight was extremely warm the seats are small in flight entertainment was the movie titanic the meals were served late to everyone which is good for them but why did we pay extra the beverages are warm ice not available if you would like to purchase additional snacks or beverages they dont offer this service the staff is not friendly were speaking portuguese the whole time i would have never booked this airline dont do it i give them two stars because the pilot did a great job of us arriving safely
15299,norwegian,7,satisfied with the airline,new york to copenhagen after some reviews i was a little nervous about flying with them but it was fine the boeing 787 is nice the mood lighting is definitely a trip and the seats were nothing special but ok i will note that i am plus sized and the seatbelt didnt fit on this particular aircraft it did fit on the flight i took from cphjfk a few days ago so apparently it was the luck of the draw anyway flight attendant was very nice about getting a seat belt extender for me i could just barely get the armrests down but luckily no one was sitting next to me so i just left the armrest up for the flight i also have mobility issues and walk with a cane and i was supposed to have priority boarding but the plane arrived late so we boarded nearly an hour late and they just did a general cattle call and everyone swarmed up to the gate in spite of the late takeoff though the flight should get to oslo nearly on time the free wifi is pretty terrible and they dont give you free water but knowing these things in advance you can bring your own food and drinks flight attendants on this flight were friendly and nice overall despite a few glitches i am satisfied with the airline and would fly them again
17020,royal brunei airlines,8,cabin attendants polite and welcoming,flew bangkok to melbourne via brunei with royal brunei both flights departed and arrived on time the check in in bangkok was efficient and polite and was able to use the priority lane for security check and immigration i boarded both flights at leisure and given priority in boarding bangkok to brunei the cabin was lightly loaded and i was given an ipad with some films on it i was reading a book so did not see what was available the seat recline was adequate and was comfortable from brunei to melbourne the cabin was completely full and the seat fully reclined to a flat bed and was very comfortable the inflight entertainment was adequate but film selection was a bit limited on both flights the quality and quantity of the food was excellent although on the melbourne to bangkok i did not get the main i wanted and decided to use the soup would have been better if it were a bit hotter royal brunei is a dry flight so no alcohol this was a problem on the flight so drink selection is a little limited the cabin attendants on both sectors were courteous friendly and provide excellent service my luggage was one of the first of the flight in melbourne i usually fly twice a year to bangkok with royal brunei and the service quality tends not to vary flights usually depart and arrive on time and the cabin attendants are always polite and welcoming
7081,china southern airlines,9,good protective barrier measures,great punctuality very good protective barrier measures make the passenger feel safe good comfort level arrival process in guangzhou managed very efficiently
4210,american airlines,1,customer service was horrible,american airlines canceled the flight my wife and i were scheduled on we sat at the orf airport for five plus hours waiting for it delay after delay we were informed it was canceled due to the incoming flight crew from new york being unable to continue on with our fight due to the delays it incurred while there getting the bad news with everyone else we overheard a lady mention that this was the third day in a row the same american airlines flight had been canceled on her due to american airlines inability to plan ahead and swap flight crews to enable us to fly later that evening when the plane did arrive it caused us to have to cancel our vacation entirely when we called american airlines directly after we were told the flight was canceled a representative told us they could not get us on another flight to our destination within the next few days the customer service rep did slip up and say there was another flight with seats on it the next day but the seats were marked up to 4k each and he told us he could not put us on that fight due to american airlines inability to plan ahead or get us on the next flight i was not able to see my daughter who flew out of houston to see us my brother and his children or my mom and stepdad all of whom i have not seen for over a year i am in the military and nothing is more disappointing than not getting to see my family the few times a year i can especially when its due to an airline company failing to uphold their end of a ticket purchase also due to the lastminute flight cancelation the nonrefundable costs we incurred include twa hotel jfk our portion of the destination accommodations and airport parking for the day we waisted sitting there my brother also flew american weeks before and had his flight canceled on him two times before he finally made it to his destination the customer service was horrible when we were on the phone they did nothing to assist us and were not able to answer most of the questions we had pertaining to our cancelled flight my advice is dont fly american unless you are prepared to have a week of delays in getting to your destination it appears this is quickly becoming their standard operating procedure
37,adria airways,7,what happened in last few months,14 flights with adria airways this year flights usually on time new aircraft clean and bright cabins cabin crew members can be nice and professional or just fine i do not know what happened in last few months according to the last flight experience this is not the right direction on a flight to moscow i experienced cabin crew getting from gloomy on a flight to svo to even gloomier on a flight back to lju no smiles just robotic and not interested in passengers and their comfort well at the end of the day the real difference is the crew attitude
19267,sun country airlines,2,never again sun country,terrible always being delayed twice within a month apart our flight was delayed we are currently sitting on the plane before take off weve been sitting here for over an hour because of weather if the flight wouldnt have been delayed we would have beaten the storm and taken off on time never again sun country
12176,jetairfly,4,last flight with jetairfly,jetairfly from brussels to boavista capeverde and return via sal boeing 767 not the newest one with zero legroom and minimal seat reclining the sixhours flight was all but pleasant i arrived with all bones aching and im just average height no decent ife either unless they consider the small screens showing nonstop your flight route to be an entertainment in the end the 6 hrs felt like they were 10hrs one warm meal basic standard you feel the charter company cutting corners everywhere jetairfly may be okay for the short range charter destinations in southern europe but i could not recommend flying it for mid to longrange for me it definitely was the last flight with jetairfly
9877,flynas,6,flynas customer review,ruhjed check in at riyadh airport was ok staff helpful boarding pass says a certain gate however the screen stated another gate flight delayed almost 45 minutes but were not informed screen was still showing on time plane was ok looked a bit tired crew seemed helpful seats looked old i dont like the leather seats but it seems a saudi way of expressing luxury it is a pay for service airline so didnt expect much space between rows is narrow and i felt the seat itself is smaller than regular airlines was not really comfortable but for a short flight was ok upon arriving in jeddah couldnt find the belt for luggage however we finally found it but with a different airline logo and different destination
11878,japan airlines,4,2 major flight delays,vancouver to bangkok via tokyo 2 weeks ago first sign of trouble began when we started circling narita and crew warned us there would be a delay in landing this made me nervous as my connecting flight to bangkok was in 15 hours we circled for nearly an hour before the captain came on the intercom and said we were being redirected to haneda airport no reason given only apology for inconvenience we landed and refueled waited another 15 hours and took off again landing at narita 45 minutes later no explanation given just sorry for inconvenience i ran into the airport hoping that my connecting flight had waited for me but it was to no avail my connecting flight had already left i had to wait in another line for 25 hours to get booked on the first morning flight to bkk and jal put me up in a narita hotel i found out that the delay was caused because an earlier aircraft had run off the runway causing the airport delay anyway bad enough get on with life a week later i show up at the airport in bangkok and jal ticket counter informs me my flight has been delayed by 3 hours oh hell not again which of course means i cannot catch my connecting flight in narita again i ask the reason for the delay they tell me its maintenance issue wait for over an hour and to jals credit they do book me a flight on eva air in business class thumbs up for that but to have 2 major flight delays by the same airline on same itinerary is pretty sad
12782,kenya airways,4,i had a very bad experience,i was connecting from lusaka to new york from kenya i got off the plane i checked the board it said gate 16 for jfk new york so i sat there waiting for the boarding call the flight for new york was supposed to departure at 1135 i sat there for almost an hour with no boarding call i asked one of the employees there what time the flight for new york was leaving she gave a vague answer than around 1140 or so they was a last boarding call the gate was charged to gate 19 i almost missed my flight and than i had to run to the gate i had a very bad experience and i dont think i will fly kenya airways again very disappointed
7121,citilink,9,arguably the best lcc in indonesia to date,yogyakarta yia to jakarta cgk onboard qg9779 the light load of this flight means that the check in was done in a very fast manner and the checkin staff dealt with our tickets and bags fairly quickly the applaudable part of it was that the checkin staff was very conscientious knowing that our seats were assigned randomly she willingly and proactively offered us to get a seat in the same row that was very nice of her boarding commenced on time and i was welcomed by the crew once again the light load of this flight meant that social distancing was possible the cabin crews started moving several passengers who have asked for a seat change to seats a and f only so that a very safe distance was created seat was comfortable well sanitized and so did the cabin there were not much to do in this short hop as we took off and landed relatively ontime overall i can see why citilink is rated as a 4star airline and a 5star airline for covid19 handling special praise goes to the crews and the ground staff of this airline for being conscientious friendly proactive and smart arguably the best lcc in indonesia to date
18053,silkair,4,nothing has changed in 5 months,flew with silk air to colombo from singapore for the second time this year and nothing has changed in 5 months the food is palatable but insufficient and nothing exceptional aircraft mainainance is practically non existent there is no inflight entertainment except that you can purchase the silk air studio app and watch a limited range of a fairly pathetic selection of movies the flight crew however are very friendly and can be chatted with easily in short silk air should not charge its premium fare because it is practically a budget airline with free meals and marginally better legroom in conclusion a dissapointing experience and forgettable to say the least
21207,turkish airlines,5,not one smile or welcome,never book and pay for emergencyextra legroom seats in row 7 on the airbus 321 aircraft the seats have no extra legroom and they do not recline so you pay 50 usd for an inferior seat to the normal free seats warning the so called flagship lounge in istanbul is like a cheap market foodhall and they only serve wine self service in hidden areas it feels like they intentionally hide the wine service onboard the plane is fine but at airport ist you feel like you are a nuisance to the surly and moody staff not one smile or welcome in two hours connecting there
20356,thomas cook airlines,3,no explanation was given,we flew through a thomas cook booking with condor airlines the flight was over four hours late leaving los angeles no explanation was given and no refreshments or food vouchers offered they tried to scam us into checking our carryons for a fee at the baggage drop and if we hadnt known our rights they might have succeeded the departure board had departure times that came and went and when we asked at the desk no explanation was given
15935,peruvian airlines,1,peruvian airlines customer review,my flight from lima to cuzco was first delayed and later cancelled because of bad weather they kept us waiting in the airport for over 5 hours all we got was a horrible little sandwich with a glass of soda we collected our luggage and were told to come back the next morning all other airline companies were flying to cuzco lanstar peru we were treated like dogs and thrown on the streets nobody even took the time to properly inform us
16169,play,6,checkin at both airports was very bad,everything excellent except the attention at the counters checkin at both airports was very bad in madrid the flight was delayed and they made us stand in line for almost an hour among the people who circulated through the airport in reykjavk we arrived 65 minutes before the departure time and in a very bad way they told us that they had closed the checkin and they did not want to check our suitcase finally they did it reluctantly todo excelente menos la atencin en mostradores en ambos aeropuertos el check in fue muy malo en madrid se demor el vuelo y nos hicieron hacer una cola de casi una hora entre medio de la gente que circulaba por el aeropuerto en reykjavk llegamos 65 minutos antes del horario de salida y de muy mal modo nos dijeron que haban cerrado el check in y no nos queran despachar la maleta finalmente lo hicieron a desgano

17482,salam air,5,as expected for a budget airline,muscat to tbilisi salam air is a fairly new budget airline operating out of muscat oman checkin in mct was extremely slow with only some 10 people in front of me i needed more than one hour to get my boarding pass at the gate at the time of boarding a 30min delay was announced which half an hour later was extended by a further 30 min this went on in increments until we finally left at 3 am instead of the scheduled 11 pm since there were hardly 30 pax on the a320 everybody had a full row for a short sleep at last return was spot on time checkin in tbilissi swift plane now packed to the last seat these are reasonably comfortable but tight as is to be expected for a budget airline there is no ife and no free food water was distributed though
10414,germanwings,5,germanwings customer review,first time i have used germanwings for connecting flights via hamburg the app does not work properly they are unable to issue both boarding cards on check in causing unnecessary inconvenience their live twitter response averages 24 hours to reply cabin crew spend most time behind front galley curtains also fail to do proper cabin secure checks prior to landing seats new ultra thin models ok for short flights seat pitch ok on the extra space seats smart fare snack boring and repetitive they have taken over a lot of lufthansa routes and to be honest they are not really geared up for it poor ground handling and communications

18253,singapore airlines,8,revitalise the quality of inflight meals,22 april flight from sg to seattle in all my experience flying with singapore airlines this was the first time i saw more stewards than stewardesses on board while the cabin crew service was excellent as usual i would like to give a special shout out and thanks to cheryl jessica and crystal for their top notch service that is befitting of the singapore girl name on the contrary the inflight meal was a disappointment from the menu selection and food quality to the presentation they are not fit to be served on board an airline as prestigious as singapore airlines the pandemic is over its time to revitalise the quality of your inflight meals
7333,comair,6,comair customer review,comair business vfa victoria falls to jnb johannesburg easy check in provided you were only travelling to jnb other pax transferring with through tickets to londonusaaustralia were unable to check bags all the way through or get boarding cards for subsequent flights this meant they had to go through customs and immigration at jnb collect bags and recheck rather than just going through transit gave them a very poor experience of bacomair in zimbabwe this is an airport used by many international pax and should be able to do this as a matter of course no lounge at vfa airport it is being rebuilt so maybe will be better in future years comfortable seats on an old b737 pleasant lunch and helpful staff

17151,royal jordanian airlines,2,fight broke out during the flight,amman to new york jfk violence on aircraft during flight aircraft was not in the greatest condition seat was uncomfortable it would have been better if not for the fact that a big fight broke out during the flight and crew did not really deal with it properly would not be my first choice
21799,virgin america,3,a disappointing experience,flew virgin america from los angeles to sydney i have to say i was extremely disappointed with the food on both flights especially breakfast and yes i know we only flew economy class but the breakfast focaccia was so tough we would have been better off eating the box it came in the noise the cabin crew made on our flight home made it hard to sleep they werent helping customers they were just sitting talking amongst themselves about what theyd been up to in the last few days our seats were at the back of the plane picked on purpose and never before have i had to ask the staff to please quieten down so we could sleep all in all a disappointing experience
4907,avelo airlines,2,staff seemed like they somewhat cared,this airline is trying but they could be a lot better the staff is mostly friendly but there are some really rude people that will kick you out of open seats if you move etc which makes zero sense since the plane is in the air this happened to me and my niece on separate flights i get that it is their business model but ultimately you are just going to just annoy people and lose business that way see oneandahalfstar review they only offer water which is fine but no one handed it out or even checked on you the two female flight attendants on my flight just sat in the back and gossiped the entire flight the pilot seemed kind and the rest of the staff seemed like they somewhat cared but most look tired and were pretty cold a smile goes a long way in this business
4762,aurigny air,4,aurigny air customer review,flew to guernsey from gatwick a great start to the new year with no security queues at gatwick wish it was always like that and a great flight on aurigny you get a choice of free soft drinks on board including tea and coffee but this excludes hot chocolate so i stumped up a 1 and had a hot chocolate and a free orange juice smooth flight on board the atr72 though i thought the aircraft looked a little tired chatting to the cabin crew i learned that aurigny is getting two new atr72 aircraft in march so that should improve matters much the same experience coming home again that evening all in all a good short trip to a wintry guernsey and great value for money
2861,air seychelles,8,air seychelles customer review,lhrsezlhr its true that there arent personal tvs like on virgin or ba but this wasnt particularly important to me id rather read a book the food was tasty and drinks are free my only niggle is that it wasnt that clear that we would be stopping
10031,french bee,8,recommend and fly with them again,i feel bad that french bee has so many negative reviews so i figured i would leave one to balance out the negative reviews and give a more accurate representation of this airline i overall thought the airline was great and i would definitely fly again considering the price my only two complaints are the seats are so tight that if my hips were any wider i wouldnt fit the seat type i was in wouldnt allow you to lift the arm rest for more room if you weigh more than like 220 pounds ouch the boarding process is also a bit chaotic i appreciate that they board the plane back to front but everyone gathers and crowds to get there to hear them call out the rows to board then its a mad rush of everyone rushing to get on board other than that i found the flight attendants friendly the plane is very clean and has a small but decent amount of entertainment options bathrooms are clean and for that price i would absolutely fly them again i feel that the people complaining about not being able to check in an hour and a half early are most likely those who are arriving last minute so thats their own fault international flights tell you three hours early so to me that doesnt sound like a french bee problem but a personal problem so cant ding them there as my flight wasnt cancelled i cant comment on the refund process but i wouldnt shy away from booking with them i was freaking myself out reading the reviews prior to my flight but my actual experience was much better than i would expect i would recommend and fly with them again
16788,rex airlines,8,by and large a good flight,i had to purchase this flight at the very last minute when jetstar cancelled my flight i enjoyed the flight service was friendly and efficient and the flight left on time the meal was ok although the taste was a bit dry the wine served was both delicious and generous by and large a good flight
9167,eva air,4,dropped in standards,i am disabled and had first class care at both airports however the flights were dreadful on the outward flight to bangkok we had paid extra both ways for an aisle seat for me as i cant climb over due to my disabilities we were 2 rows back from the exit row seats and just before take off i noticed they were free i ask one of the crew politely if due to my disability we may move she said yes but it will be 150 each and you have to pay in cash i thought she was joking and then she repeated 300 cash during the flight i went to use the toilet closest to us and again due to my disability found it difficult due to the size when i came out i stood to stretch my legs and a fellow passenger told me that at the rear of the plane they had a disabled toilet so next time i went to the rear and there it was it was occupied so i waited a few minutes until a crew member came and said the normal toilet is free across the other side she saw i had my walking stick and i said i will wait until this one is free she said it is not occupied but locked for staff use only i asked if due to my disability i could use it and she just said no crew only i was amazed i have to say on both these issues plus the general attitude of all the crew on the outward flight the food had also dropped in standards as well

12981,korean air,2,made me dislike this airline,seoul to tokyo unprofessional and disappointing check in boarding and the beginning of the flight went smooth the seats was comfortable with plenty of leg space that was when things went downhill my friends entertainment system wasnt working and flight attendants ignore us despite us trying to get their attention food was bland and mushy the head flight attendant was rushing to get food out as she kept sighing and was rude especially to the non koreans however things started to go bad at the end of the flight the plane had already landed and was slowly making its way to the terminal when a little girl about 3 years old suddenly had to use the bathroom the mum asked one of the flight attendant if her daughter could use the bathroom the flight attendant went to ask her supervisor who was the rude head flight attendant to which she told the mum to tell her daughter to hold it the daughter was crying and kept saying how much it hurts my friend who isnt korean but understands the language translated the mum resorted to using a plastic bag for her daughter to uninate in the middle of the plane of course the little kid didnt want to so the mum desperate just took her daughter to the bathroom by this point its been 15 minutes since weve landed and was nowhere near the terminal while i understand the importance of being in your seats while the plane is moving for our safety certain protocol should be broken if there is a situation that arises the head flight attendant on this flight or at least in charge of my section made me dislike this airline which is disappointing as ive enjoyed this airline when i flew with them 10 days ago
12645,jin air,1,very poor service,seoul to manila clark i am traveling with my disabled husband and the front desk who print our boarding pass was terrible she gave us a terrible bad service she didnt care about all my request for my husband like wheelchair and seat assignment in short they dont care about those disabled passenger they just gonna do what they want very poor service
446,aerolineas argentinas,7,a reasonable experience,all four legs were right on time the seating was fine the a330 out of jfk has angled lie flat seats which are obviously not the latest and best but which i always find perfectly adequate the domestic flights were on brand new embraers with 1x2 seating and ample pitch based on this experience the airline seems to have the basics really pulled together the only disappointment was the catering dinner on the way down was served sloppily congealed olive oil no sp cling wrap on the dishes and really unappetizing and whats with the generic and generically tasting red or white wine service shouldnt the flagship airline of this wonderful wine country take some pride and feature the best of their production but i dont fly to eat and i didnt on the way back there is predeparture sustenance in the lounge though not in ars own lounge at eze and the fares are good so overall a reasonable experience
4469,anadolujet,2,always at least 1 hour delay,i fly by anadolujet 810 times in a year there is always at least 1 hour delay also dont trust their website because on their website it shows as no delay but at the airport there are delays the seabus from yenikapiistanbul to bandirma will be much quicker comfortable and cheaper than anadolujet
13037,korean air,8,would fly korean air again,business class from singapore to seoul we checkedin from terminal 4 there is an exclusive area in the lounge for first class passengers food was below average flight service and smile was good ife was acceptable camera onboard was acceptable and the seat was extremely comfortable on this 6 hour flight i was disappointed though that no amenity kit was provided on this redeye flight we arrived at terminal 2 in incheon airport where the experience was extremely positive for us compared to terminal 1 i would definitely fly korean air again however unfortunately they do not have routes to the middle east
5405,bangkok airways,7,everything went fine,yangon to bangkok everything went fine flight on time special meal accommodated soft and semisoft drinks provided got an extra hot meal fas professional disembarking in bangkok a total humiliation as we had to go several kilometers by bus no ife luggage included not cheap
2230,air malta,4,air malta customer review,manchester to malta a319 22nd december 2014 checkin was slow which was a bad start and it got worse our economy seats had minimal legroom and when the passenger in front put his seat back just after takeoff i was trapped there was no entertainment system other than a map showing the planes location and the meal of chicken curry with a bread roll and tiny mince pie was embarrassingly poor for a scheduled flight it was pretty bad and the best bit was leaving the plane on arrival at luqa
13069,kulula,8,nice airline on time,johannesburg to cape town nice airline and on time my only gripe is the horrible cloth seats on the europcar aircraft reminds me of british rail seats of old time for a refurb me thinks
3319,airasia india,1,staff are inefficient,bengaluru to chennai we were made to wait for half an hour in the baggage drop line line was short staff were inefficient our eboarding pass expired before our flight and we had to get a new one with different seats we had to wait for the bus again for 10 minutes in the hot sun before we could board the flight we took airasia from chennai to bangalore as well similar experience staff are inefficient ground crew and processes terrible not recommended at all
13109,kulula,4,kulula customer review,jnb to durban on time and crew were great loved the comedy in the announcements aircraft clean and not too tired recommend them to anyone looking for well priced flights in south africa
17537,sata air azores,4,not ignore the mistreatment,on 26th december i took a flight from toronto with connecting flights in porta del gado and lisbon and a final destination of seville spain unfortunately the azores flight from ponta del gado to lisbon was delayed due to operational technicalities within the lisbon airport backing up the airport for most of the day as a result i arrived in lisbon minutes before the initial scheduled boarding for my next tap flight was set to take place fearful that i would miss it i received a text message to my phone from azores airlines stating that my next flight had been delayed itself over one hour however given the timing i was still cutting it close upon arriving at my tap boarding gate i was made aware that the flight i was set to take next was indeed delayed two hours itself meaning that i had made it in time and would be able to fly out shortly after getting to the front of the line awaiting to board the tap attendant told me quite matter of factly that my ticket had been sold due to my past flights delay and that my next flight would not be for another 10 hours naturally i was shocked and disappointed not only to spend 10 additional hours in the airport but for the fact that my plans made in spain would not take place losing an entire day of travel upon pleading with the attendee she told me that it wasnt her dilemma offering no consolation and asking me to take it up with the azores officials as it was not a tap issue that my ticket was given away i then tracked down the azores customer service department they told me they were sorry for what had happened however there was nothing they could do seemingly confused with the events that had taken place the representative told me all they could offer me at that moment was two 10 euro vouchers for lunch and dinner at the airport i found this an incredible lack of compensation given the loss of a day of travel 10 hours spent in an airport as well as no prior communication as to my ticket being sold after inquiring about my luggage it was only after my question that she explained to me they had no track on its whereabouts i was then forced with the task of lining up for nearly an hour to find my luggage from the lost and found and lining up again to check my bags for my next flight the next several hours were as one could expect not the ideal setting for the first day of ones holiday the lack of adequate customer service the lack of communication as well as the lack of compensation is astounding in my eyes the fact that i wasnt made aware of this decision the airline had made for me especially after receiving a text message previously with an update is astounding i cannot believe how i was treated between the two airlines on this day compensation in the form of two meal vouchers for a loss of a day of travel poor service and 10 additional hours in an airport is comical i have never voiced a formal complaint in this manner however given these circumstances i simply could not ignore the mistreatment i am a frequent flyer and often travel to europe this is a very deterring event when considering azores airlines in the future any sort of response given the situation would be appreciated
6834,china airlines,8,the seat is comfortable,the cabin is clean the seat is comfortable the ambience is quiet flight attendants are friendly and helpful the food is delectable and fresh the price is reasonable
3184,airasia,2,airasia customer review,i booked return flights bandung singapore on 5th september 2022 i subsequently received an email from airasia on 15 october telling me that my flights were cancelled due to operational reasons a promise is made for the refund to be made in 30 days now more than a month later the refund is still in progress and no further advisories to enlighten me the status except from what i see in my account on their website airasia has no customer service no customer service phone number not even an email address all they have is an online chatbot named ava which is worse than useless so you are on your own should any problems arise after you confirm your booking will definitely avoid flying airasia if i had a choice
8406,edelweiss air,1,terrible customer service,a couple of days before leaving for florida got an email from edelweiss offering an upgrade to business for cash less than an hour later i called and booked the upgrade for my wife and i a short while later got another email from them telling me there were no upgrades available terrible customer service
9335,fiji airways,8,i was not disappointed,nadi to los angeles this was my second time flying on fiji airways the first time being a few hours earlier when i flew from brisbane to nadi this was a relatively long flight nearly 11 hours so i expected a different level of service and comfort and i was not disappointed the flight crew including pilots were polite courteous and service oriented we were greeted with a warm bula hello and a smile the staff were great for business class i thought the cabin was a bit cramped 222 configuration but the seats were comfortable and i was quite comfortable while sleeping we were given a large pillow a duvet and a blanket more than adequate for comfort i found the food on the flight to be better than average but not outstanding but then again the price point of fiji airways is very reasonable and thus this was not unexpected the amenity kit offered was different in that it featured a hydrating mist in addition to the usual moisturizing cream ear plus socks eye mask etc i found that to be a really nice touch and i must say that the scent of the moisturizer was wonderful when given the chance i will fly fiji airways again
11948,jeju air,8,i will definitely recommend,clark to seoul smooth flight on jeju air and i am impressed i had to think twice on booking because jeju air has a bad review and most of its customers were left unhappy and unsatisfied on their flight so we took the risk and booked on the flight day we are expecting to pay for our baggage as the website says our ticket doesnt have a free baggage allowance usually lccs allow their passengers one check in baggage per person but in the airport we were three the check in agent checked our bags for free 5 pieces the flight was very smooth though the attendants were not always present on the cabin they just served the free water before landing i will definitely recommend
1851,air india,1,no inflight entertainment,no inflight entertainment when i asked the staff regarding this they clearly said that the airline knew about this and they have taken the aircraft from the hangar and deployed it the journey was 12 hours and with no in flight entertainment it was a nightmare the return journey from delhi to melbourne was the same if not worse no7 inflight entertainment again no reclining seats with my ticket purchase i paid to have the in flight entertainment as a part of what this airline advertised this is false advertising
6854,china airlines,6,mostly pleasantly surprised,bangkok to honolulu via taipei i fly regularly between honolulu and bangkok but ive never flown on china airlines however it emerged as the leastexpensive option for a recent trip and since the price and flight schedules were good i decided to give the airline a try despite some hesitation i was mostly pleasantly surprised by the airline though the staff seem to be unable to smile and service both on the ground and in the air is barebones the a350 is a fabulous aircraft the seats were mostly comfortable and the entertainment system was alright there were a few negative experiences for instance not one single flight arrived or departed on time the airlines pillows and blankets are pitiful and the catering is mostly inedible china airlines has the serving style favored by many asian airlines wherein a few drinks choices are offered on top of the meal service trolleys and if a passenger requests anything not on top of the trolley the flight attendants tend to lie and say they ran out its very very tedious to constantly have to ask and remind them for something as simple as a can of coke zero and for it to be brought with a scowl i arrived at taipei from honolulu in the middle typhoon mitag my onward flight to bangkok that evening was cancelled and i was expecting a chaotic uncomfortable evening in taipeis airport much to my surprise the situation had been rather expertly arranged before my arrival an agent met our flight and informed all of us going to bangkok that we had been rescheduled for a flight the following morning and that accommodation had been arranged for us for that evening i was impressed by the efficiency of china airlines and the taipei airport authorities and i commend them for their handling of a difficult situation in all i recommend china airlines because of the very low cost paid for this set of flights while china airlines certainly pales in comparison to ana jal eva air thai airways and singapore airlines it is at least as good as korean air
3815,alaska airlines,2,delayed arrival of airplane,an almost 2hr delay with super clear skies because of their own reasons delayed arrival of airplane and then waiting 50 min in the plain to get a lane to fly
3494,airasia x,4,not happy with this flight,i was on airasia x flight from seoul to kuala lumpur the flight duration was 6 hours plus and the cabin was warm i was seated at quiet zone window seat 8k and had to endure the warmth informed the air stewardess to check the air conditioner and she replied would check with captain but she never returned nor the condition had improved the seat and leg room are narrow and designed not for comfort food quality dropped too the pak nasser nasi lemak is not fresh and tasted salty not happy with this flight
15988,philippine airlines,4,flight attendants are very hospitable,we were served 2 meals for my 9 hour flight and the serving is i would say is complete flight attendants are very hospitable and willing to help for the negatives crowded leg space for economy class for their dxbmnl flights they are using the same crowded aircraft for many years and not one ounce of this have improved im stuck with the same airline over and over again because its my employer who chooses the flight and not me not only the leg spaces are crowded the inflight entertainment is inconvenient they have but you have to download an app for it on your mobile and connect to the aircraft wifi while thats not a bad idea this consumes battery and seats dont have charging slots it feels like they never considered improving their middle east flights since most passengers are filipino expatriates but of course their flights going to countries such asus canada uk australia are way better better leg space and actual screens for inflight entertainment not to mention all of my flights to dubai from manila are late 12 hours delayed
13297,lan airlines,8,crew extremely friendly,i flew auckland to sydney with lan airlines it was my first flight on a boeing 787 and i was impressed by the level of confort the bigger windows with electronic shadowing is a very good difference the entertainment is pretty good but they should increase the number of language versions for example a documentary in the business session was only in portuguese the breakfast was not the best but fine the cabin crew extremely friendly and with a positive mood i would not mind to fly with them on a longer flight to fully test their product
18221,singapore airlines,9,service was excellent as expected,sq silver kris lounge in changi t3 was as good as normal with excellent food choices and good seating the flight itself was uneventful despite a slight delay on departure the flight was quite bumpy for sometime over japan which was expected and announced by the captain though this had nothing to do with the airline i realized that american carriers tend to change route and altitude when encountering turbulence while asian carriers seem just to go through that and i experienced that quite consistently i ordered my meals through bookthecook and the boon tong kee chicken rice was underwhelming while the lobster thermidor was nice service was excellent as expected wifi was complementary for j passengers and it worked quite well
127,aegean airlines,5,told i was a standby passenger,at airport checkin 3 hours early i was told i was a standby passenger despite booking months in advance and receiving a confirmation i was told this was the policy of overbooking flights by 10
14413,malaysia airlines,8,onboard cabin crew were friendly,a short hop scheduled to be half an hour on a maswings malaysia airlines regional subsidiary serving rural borneo routes turboprop plane which was marred by an hours delay in taking off from miri the reason given was that the internet was down in the airport so certain data couldnt be downloaded to complete the documentation to permit the plane to fly and we had to wait in the aircraft till this was resolved onboard cabin crew were friendly and even on this short segment a drink nuts and biscuits were served for free which was a nice touch there was even a full airline magazine in the seat pocket in front which many airlines have done away with since covid and a plastic handfan in case of heat though the aircraft is fully airconditioned amazing views of the rain forest en route to mulu as the cruising altitude was quite low all staff encountered in the airports and onboard were very polite
1992,air juan,1,not received refund after 9 months,do not book with this airline it is a complete scam flights are regularly cancelled hours before the scheduled takeoff for maintenance and then a refund is never given my wife and i were left scrambling to arrange alternative flights and we have not received any refund after 9 months of waiting if you look online you will find hundreds of similar reviews
5843,bmi regional,2,never been on time except once,bristol to aberdeen i have flown with bmi regional like more than 12 times this year but the flight from aberdeen to bristol or back has never been on time except once the most unreliable airline even when they eventually have a plan ready to flight passengers after delay the process of getting passengers to plane is pedestrian
16351,qantas airways,2,ever increasing delays at qantas,despite the aircraft arriving from hong kong 5 hours before the flight to singapore boarding was delayed by 1 hour in sydney gate staff continuously blamed other factors such as cleaning staff taking longer than required or no gate available as reasons for the delay when questioned on boarding as to why the plane couldnt be cleaned in the preceding 5 hours i was simply told to email customer care which seems to be the go to response for most qantas ground staff these days when confronted with polite complaints about the ever increasing delays at qantas cabin crew were pleasant and helpful and the economy class supervisor was amazing as she singled my family out for special attention and care this had more to do with my frequent flyer status rather than just being a passenger receiving great service aircraft was 19 years old and showing its age broken fittings on the seats and in the toilets ripped seat covers and damaged wall panels the plane had clearly seen better days seats are narrow and leg room and recline are minimal compared to the likes of other major airlines food was inedible bland and prison canteen style qantas have dispensed with trays containing an assortment of items and metal cutlery is no longer you now just get a small portioned bowl with foil on top and a piece of bread slapped on the foil and some wooden cutlery in an envelope silver lining is that its easy to slip the bowl on the floor under your seat when you decide not to eat anything qantas is doing just enough so as not to be seen as a budget carrier while charging a premium price flight arrived 30 minutes late and bags were out by the time we got to the carousel but that has more to do with the efficiency of singapore changi international airport than qantas
11875,japan airlines,3,not a good experience,seattle to tokyo narita not a good experience cabin crew were fantastic and graceful but the seat one of the newer lay flat suites was clostrophobic with the divider up hate the boeing 787 electronic window blinds because they do not get completely dark on a flight heading west they do not stop the sun shining into the cabin and heating it up ife was ok but not outstanding although the crew were great the food japanese set was not fresh the drink service was slow as well which for a flight that is not too long delayed food service and resulted in little time for sleep lounge in seattle was really poor the club and not up to biz class standards sakura lounge in nrt was not much better all in all will not fly jal again to asia from west coast
14403,malawian airlines,8,flight was surprisingly good,dar es salaam to lilongwe via blantyre both legs on a dash 8 q400 the seats still have the same colors as ethiopian and information is displayed both in english and amharic booking and online checkin both go through the website of ethiopian and are smooth as long as the standard android browser is not used baggage drop off at dar airport is also handeled well and staff is friendly turns out to be the crew of the flight the flight leaves dar at 745 in the morning and takes 2 hours to blantyre during which a hot breakfast is served my preordered vegetarian option included hashbrowns beans greens and a grilled tomato surprisingly tasty the aircraft is as noisy as a turboprop is but in a good condition and clean the crew is friendly and welcoming but i could feel that malawian is a small airline and not so experienced as ethiopian for example would be flight to blantyre was on time stopover quick 40 minutes onward passengers can stay in the aircraft and the short hop to lilongwe also on time putting the flight in a nutshell as malawian is a small airline with only 2 aircraft dash 8 and 737700 and only a handful of destinations in east africa the flight was surprisingly good and i would fly them again
2964,air tahiti nui,8,air tahiti nui customer review,paris cdg to los angeles good food crew entertainment and leg space i enjoyed the whole island theme that was experienced onboard a plus about the entire experience was the level of visibility and attention the crew provided with frequent water runs and prompt responses to call bell another feature was the snack bar set up at the galley for passengers flight departed and arrived on time
8420,edelweiss air,5,edelweiss air customer review,zrhlaszrh for business reasons as it was a direct flight never again in economy the plane had a delay for 10 hours due to technical reasons that could happen i prefer to fly safely but after these 10 hours waiting no extra drink onboard all we got was a piece of paper explaining the problem im 188 cm tall and i cant recommend economy class for people who need some legroom and have to sit there for 12 hours the crew was very friendly but could not change anything as the flight was fully booked next time i will fly via sfo
1059,air berlin,2,inconvenience and rudeness,stockholm to chicago air berlin is the worst airline ive had an experience with i landed in chicago after four months of studying abroad in sweden only to see that myself and my friend didnt have any of our luggage arrive this was on december 22nd so this clearly affected how our holidays were going to be spent after calling and calling and emailing they had lost my bag found it again lost it in copenhagen found it again finally 6 days later on the 28th i received my bags i missed a trip for christmas giving presents all of my personal items etc air berlin was rude about the process and i would never recommend flying with them if you have baggage air berlin get a solid two thumbs down for inconvenience and rudeness
2603,air niugini,6,a very pleasant surprise,singapore to port moresby given the limited choice available on the market to reach port moresby only qantas and air philippines travel there i was forced to take air niugini it was a very pleasant surprise plane was not too old cabin was very decent clean entertainment somewhat limited but of reasonable quality food was ok plane is almost always empty which means lots of space also in economy board personnel is not as shiny as you could see on emirates or qatar but kind gentle and professional a surprise
6350,canadian north,6,canadian north customer review,i fly this airline regularly between yellowknife and edmonton staff is generally friendly and the complimentary food service is a nice touch but generally inedible unfortunately they have the tendency to change your seats without notice and you will not find out until checkin time much of the reason for this change is that if they notice a flight is only half booked they use half of the plane for cargo which eliminates the first 6 rows of seats thus when booking on canadian north make sure you book the back row of seats between 1016 and you likely wont have to worry about your seat being changed prepare to be packed in like sardines on most canadian north flights though seat pitchwidth is standard
6842,china airlines,7,i was upgraded to premium economy,ho chi minh city to frankfurt via taipei a good experience overall i departed at 0545 pm and meals were served 3 times 1 dinner in the connecting flight from hcmc to taipei and 2 on the flight from taipei to frankfurt the food was good but there were not many options and the menu was the same for both departing and returning flights the crew were friendly and caring they noticed when i felt uncomfortable due to low temperature inside the cabin and offered hot drinks the seat was comfortable im a rather small girl 162cm in height so i had no problem with legroom but it might have been a bit cramped for some other passengers around me my returning date was a busy day for frankfurt airport so i had a delayed takeoff which made me miss my connecting flight from taipei to hcmc i had a long delay at taoyuan airport the airlines handled the situation well they offered me to stay in their lounge and took care of my baggage coupons for food and bevarage were also given the best part was i was upgraded to premium economy on my flight back to hcmc
20157,thai lion air,1,nothing is offered free,bangkok to chiang rai the gate closed 15 minutes pass the departure time to pack on more passengers slow boarding and unboarding system 30 minutes delay nothing is offered free water costs money
2328,air mauritius,6,air mauritius customer review,we recently travelled as a family of 5 from melbourne to paris and london return perth mauritius paris london mauritius perth on air mauritius we found the airline to be no frills and got us from a to b efficiently my complaints are the economy class seats on the older airbus a340300s operating from london and paris to mauritius were worn uncomfortable and had a terrible entertainment system i struggled to sleep the whole 12 hours the newer airbus a330200s operating the mauritius to perth route was more comfortable and had a better newer entertainment system though the particular flight we were on was packed full and quite uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight the cabin crew did their job but did not go out of their way to offer any additional service the food service onboard depended on which route you fly on the parisian route we got a decent curry dinner and a refreshing french breakfast but on the perth flight we only received a bland meal at about midnight and a horrible hot vegetable substance in a bread roll for arrival when all we felt like having something refreshing i noticed a large majority of people did not eat it in the end it was an ok airline and would recommend it if you are stopping over in mauritius
7697,croatia airlines,8,croatia airlines customer review,flew rome to dubrovnik off peak which involved 2 stops last year and i thought they provided great service we had 3 flights romezagrebsplitdubrovnik and they were all on time which made everything perfect they provided good assistance when we had to go through customs in zagreb giving us priority as we needed to take off soon crew even fought a bit with airport staff to get our passports reviewed faster also were very attentive with us as airport staff barely spoke english planes were modern and very clean they provided some snacks but all flights were really short will fly them again if i have the chance
12870,klm royal dutch airlines,2,this was a first and not in a good way,this was a first and not in a good way i book my flights well in advance to get the seat i want like for a lot of people this is very important to me i especially wouldnt fly in a window seat long haul as it would be like being in prison so i booked the seat i wanted i looked a couple of days before the flight and it was still ok and checked in as soon as i could at the airport bangkok i checked in my luggage at the desk about 25 hours before the flight and was given a boarding pass still showing my choice of seat when they announced boarding about 40 mins before takeoff my boarding pass was refused and the klm staff said i had been kicked out of my seat for a family when the business section was full i had a look and there were no children so they must have called a family just a couple who couldnt be bothered to book their seats in advance this is the only time in doing this route for 33 years with various airlines that this has happened and even as a platinum member i will not put myself at risk of it happening again as it ruined the entire flight bye bye klm
954,air austral,6,air austral customer review,sydney to noumea business class fast check in at sydney airport they use the qantas club which was nice boarding delayed for 45minutes due to late arriving aircraft business class roomy and seats comfortable not lie flat but very angled crew spoke mainly french and some broken english but they are a french airline food good service attentive and friendly didnt use the inflight entertainment overall not a bad product
4407,ana all nippon airways,7,staff welcoming and friendly,haneda to kuala lumpur with ana all nippon airways the flight into japan was wonderful staff were welcoming and friendly however i was a little disappointed with the check in process on my outgoing flight once i was told of the weight limit for each baggage i was given an extra box to move items into which is greatly appreciated it would be even better if the weighing scales were pointed out to passengers with the same fate as i in the future quite a few of their staff could not understand simple english this also should be improved in the future thanks for your service during this flight
6498,caribbean airlines,3,caribbean airlines customer review,jfkposgeo return cabin was okay staff unfriendly and no entertainment not allowed to exit piarco despite a 6 hour wait and they changed the gate number 10 mins before departure time meaning everyone had to go through security check again
5699,blue air,7,awesome cabin staff service,lisbon to torino the flight was delayed 20 minutes but the ground staff kept us informed of updates the seats were ok and sandwiches drinks provided were good what made this trip awesome was the cabin staff service one staff even made some coffee just for my family when we asked for some if other staff are half as good the human touch will easily make up for other sometimes systemic low cost carrier shortcomings
1255,air canada rouge,4,take you to where you need,they will take you to where you need nevertheless in the months before the flights we had a few time changes at the airport we had to show vaccination records four times despite the fact that we uploaded it to their app the boarding zone system is confusing and separating family members on the way back there was an hour delay from narita and a gate change in montreal now there is another delay in the transit to newark i paid for wifi from japan to canada and it didnt work
16928,royal air maroc,7,a quality service,casablanca to paris orly a quality service a competitive price friendly staff clean cabins and a superb ram boarding area in casablanca not to mention a very good application for phones fr un service qualit un prix comptitif du personnel aimable des cabines propres et une superbe zone dembarquement ram casablanca sans oublier une trs bonne application pour les tlphones
1533,air dolomiti,7,air dolomiti customer review,flew from pisa to munich on an atr 72 never flew on that model before and was amazed nice aircraft service was ok and the flight arrived on time seating was ok little narrow but then again its only a regional airline the whole operation had an italian charm all in all a nice small charismatic airline
8801,estonian air,2,estonian air customer review,tallinnkievtallinn using estonian air is like using a scheduled bus service in best case they will get you from a to b without any amenities estonian uses b 737500 seat pitch is average both flights were on time luggage arrived as well on board service has to be paid extra for a flight of about 2 hours this is not much i use them because it is the only direct link between tallinn and kiev but if there was any quality airline i would prefer them
22732,wizz air,1,have been consistently terrible,wizz air from start to finish have been consistently terrible from numerously changing our flying times to trying to check in to charging us for seat then splitting us all up then unable to claim that money back the whole process at the airport and on the plane was rushed and complete chaos then to rub salt in the wound we were asked to take our rubbish with us because they did not have time to clean the plane the state of the toilets verified this also just a warning if you book through an agent the wizz air totally wash their hands of you so all i can say is travel with wizz air at your peril they have lost 6 future customers here and by the comments of many on the plane they have lost even more i have put na for inflight entertainment but the cabin staff certainly looked like a cabaret act
14642,mauritania airlines,4,never been on such dirty planes,freetown to dakar via conakry my second time flying this airline and both times a similar experience filthy planes terrible food but very punctual departures i have never been on such dirty planes it would appear that they are rarely cleaned even when flying from their homebase seats generally dont recline most of the buttons no longer work the food generally consists of a variety of dry breadlike items and are best avoided i think it is the only airline where crew dont have a uniform rather they seem to purchase their own similarcoloured clothing however all flights depart and land on time a rarity in west africa

9160,eva air,3,so bad and customer unfriendly,my wife and i we are really outraged by the way we have been treated by the eva air br75 team the flight times have been moved up to 5 times due to technical issues finally it was the next day in the meantime we received 2 food vouchers which could be used at a limited number of shops the route from the gate to the shops was a long walk and then back we are an elderly couple and not very mobile by the time we got to a snack shop there was already a queue of 50 people reason many of those kind of shops were closed due to renovations so we had to walk even further at the end of the day we had to go to another gate we had to wait again without further information finally we followed the whole group of people to the immigration gate we had to hand over our passports it is therefore forbidden according to the dutch government to hand over your passport only if there is legal approval for this a copy of our passports was not accepted if we refuse they wouldnt help us any further so we had to do this after a 30 minute bus ride we arrived at a hotel waiting endlessly again we got a very basic room no hot water no luggage we got a meal went to bed exhausted at 11 pm got up at 3 am because we had to take the bus to the airport at 4 am waiting again no one from eva air was there to explain anything 500 passengers in small groups were searching for information or help the flight was not listed and only around 0730 the staff arrived and boarding could begin we had to wait a long time for our passports because a pile of numbered passports had been dropped we are regular customers of eva air but we dont recognize the service anymore this was so bad and customer unfriendly this brings down the reputation of the company way down we have submitted a complaint but unfortunately have not received any response
11448,insel air,1,unfriendly with customers,insel air from miami to aruba on 11212015 was delayed for 6 hours scheduled dep time was 1500 actual dep was 2100 reason given was maintenance issues with plane i had a connecting flight from aruba to bonaire flight431 which had left already at the time of arrival in aruba we the passengers were told that flight 431 would wait for us in aruba for the flight to bonaire which was not the case we were told that there is another flight at 900 to bring us to bonaire which was not the case either we eventually were flown out from aruba to bonaire at 430 on 1122 and arrived a whole day late i booked hotel and scuba diving excursions which were lost to me the return flight from bonaire to curacao flight 302 on 11242015 which was scheduled to depart at 700 actually departed at 0900 the flight from curacao to miami on 11242015 was scheduled to depart at 1000 but was delayed again to 2200 which was a 12 hour delay reason again maintenance issues with the plane i purchased a ticket on aa from curacao to miami which departed on time at 1620 i paid 219 for the aa flight back to miami i asked inselair repeatedly to issue either a partial refund or voucher andor pay for my return ticket form curacao to miami on 1124 with aa in the amount of 219 the airline declined to offer any reimbursement for these extensive delays on both outbound and return flights in my opinion this airline is also extremely unfriendly with customers the passengers were repeatedly lied to by the ground personnel and station managers in miami and curacao we were repeatedly told that the plane from aruba to bonaire flight 431 would wait for us in aruba which as not the case

23041,xl airways france,1,i highly recommend this airline,after flying the 1155 pm xl airways france flight from new york jfk to paris and returning a week later i have to say this was the best airline i have flown it was a new plane seats were tight like all economy flights but i was fairly comfortable staff was very friendly and the flight took off and landed on time both trips the meal was pretty good and they walked around constantly offering free water throughout the flight they had drinks but i was okay with water the movies were in french but i slept so it didnt matter i spent half what i would have on any other flight and it would have been a waste the flight was perfect and i highly recommend this airline
4259,american eagle,5,try to avoid american in the future,booked this round trip around 3 weeks in advance was rather expensive and i felt tricked into paying to reserve my seat at the time of booking i found out subsequently that reserving was free within 24hrs of the flight i felt it was mean of the airline to charge for 1 checked bag i have flown many times with various european asian and us airlines in the past 40 years and this is the first time i have incurred these charges on top of what i believe to have been an expensive flight in the first place the staff encountered as well as the flights themselves were no better or worse than the competition i will try to avoid american in the future
12992,korean air,6,experience onboard korean was underwhelming,the experience onboard korean was underwhelming flew from dlcicnlax the first leg was a quick hour flight onboard a 777 with good entertainment and was served a small lunch consisting of a chicken sandwich pineapple and a beverage the second leg was delayed for 15 hours after boarding due to technical issues leg space and seating on a380 was great however i found the inflight entertainment and meals subpar the movie offerings were limited with a few new releases and between 1520 old movies moreover meals left a lot to be desired as the portions were small and snack options were limited to asian shrimp crackers plain crackers and banana bread cabin stewardess did a fine job going through the motions of carrying on their duties but there wasnt any personal touch or personality to their interactions id fly korean air again if the price is less than better competitors
6665,cathay pacific airways,6,cathay is now in the middle of the pack,my how things have changed we flew cathay 5 years ago when our son went to school in hong kong cathay rivaled the best airlines just completed a flight flight attendants still wonderful facilities very good as always very nicely designed business class seats food way worse did not even serve a dinner on our flight just a lunch and breakfast and it really was nothing special no more pajamas either on a 15 hour flight amenity kit also got a downgrade cathay is now in the middle of the pack as far as im concerned no longer a top airline i would imagine the slowdown in hong kong has really hurt them and they decided to cheapen the product too bad
6619,cathay pacific airways,1,worst customer service ever,every aspect of my first and last experience with cathay pacific has been a nightmare firstly they cancelled and automatically rebooked me on flights which didnt match up the connecting flight leaving before the inbound one landing and it took a whole month of emails to rectify i was asked to register details for priority check in 48 hours before boarding and this automatically triggered a move for the booking from my ba account to their asiamiles account which i am still trying to rectify with zero replies from cathay despite me meticulously adding my ba number to the booking they then lost my luggage and what was going to be a 24 hour delay turned into a four day wait my bags went on a grand tour amsterdamistanbulhong kongmelbourne the au150 given to me initially provided essentials for the first day in melbourne and i was assured id by someone managing baggage loss that id be reimbursed for any other essentials which came to just over 200 on providing receipts i was offered au50 because the items bought will have residual value i mean they can have these items sent to them if they like i just wanted my baggage through all of the above i have tried to use the whatsapp customer service they advertise which is utterly utterly pointless it takes 24 hours for someone to reply with you must be busy now please contact us again if you need help as if youre monitoring your whatsapp 247 i have an archive of around 150 curtailed whatsapp chats worst customer service ever
6062,british airways,3,most uncomfortable flight,most uncomfortable flight i have ever experienced its a long time since i have flown longhaul the cramped conditions were awful the rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my tv was so close i couldnt focus on it ba seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade this has not worked on me i will avoid flying ba in future my onward flight was with latam same 787 aircraft but more room between rows far more comfortable on the return flight from santiago the lights were turned down at 8pm i feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service they just disappear behind the curtains
15163,norse atlantic airways,5,wont be rushing back to fly with norse,i wont be rushing back to fly with norse air again the meals are very small the meals are tasty but quite pricey i had chicken mash the snack before we landed was sorrentina tomato and mozzarella tasty hot but tiny they give you wooden knife fork spoon very hard to cut with their flimsy wooden knife if you dont order a meal you have to pay for tea and coffee normal coffee is 350 usd on the plane they only served drinks twice in 11 hours on the flight from london to los angeles first cup of tea was barely lukewarm coffee was hotter but not hot exit row was empty many passengers asked could they move to the exit row after we got into the flight but they were told only if you pay usd 50 for an upgrade so three seats in the exit row stayed empty the whole 11 hours i thought it was a bit mean movie selection was the best thing about norse i paid extra for an aisle seat in economy not much room got up on my feet every hour to stretch will definitely chose the competition instead of going with norse again they had a big launch for their july london to usa flights but the passengers dont get treated to any luxury also checkin at gatwick was very strange you had to wait to get into the queue for the checkin i overheard passengers being told by checkin staff monitoring the queue to get off their mobile phones when they are in the norse queue very strange indeed you have to preorder pay for the hot food online before you fly you have to pay for a blanket and you have to pay for earphones
4535,arkefly,8,arkefly customer review,amsauaams i regularly fly arkefly between europe and the antilles and what a huge difference between the old and worn 767300 with barely enough space to breathe and the new 787800 with more spacious seats ptv and a so much better experience furthermore the crew seems to enjoy the dreamliner much more and even smiles are being made also the time of always being delayed also seems to be over arkefly improved a lot with the dreamliner and i even prefer arkefly above klm now as long as they fly the dreamliner
17857,shanghai airlines,9,was a very positive surprise,hong hong to budapest via shanghai flew on a320 on hkg to shanghai while in a newer b7879 on the long haul to budapest china eastern marketed flights the long haul leg was flown by their daughter company shanghai airlines to budapest amazing experience pure adventure bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to europe as a huge bargain for 347 usd including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near xmas it costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which i volunteered as i needed the extra miles for my elite status however i was notified 2 months before travel by my online travel agent travelgenio that the return flight from budapest was preponed by 1 hour then i was forced to change as i would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure i then decided to change plans completely and celebrate new year in budapest instead of vietnam thus i postponed my return travel from budapest by 3 days this was done by emails to the travel agent no response and then phone calls to ch eastern in brisbane and shanghai eventually it went smoothly and i was changed to my wish without added costs apart from changing onward flights beyond hong kong with another airline that even allowed me to do another cheap detour to hanoi on my way back to hue the homepages of china eastern and shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from unless one has a chinese telephone number however 10 days before departure i could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat however one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with ces flyer program in which i am not interested apart from that it was a good adventure a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong but all went smooth arrived in hongkong early and was able to checkin 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily no queues at the checkin and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking english two bps issued immediately flying hkgpvg is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic that give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving hkg and passing pvg first flight was on an aged a320 extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers onboard newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered bring own headset shared monitors showed some educational movies food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits drinks were unlimited water tea coffee beers but only for 1 hour out of the 2 hour long flight during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 minutes after kickoff and again 40 minutes before landing that leaves passengers with very limited time of service fas were fine the second flight were by shanghai airlines boeing 787 it was a very positive surprise and was faultless modern aircraft good food and service 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast frequent drink rounds button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly individual ife on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of western and english translated movies toilets clean both flights took off earlier than scheduled

4776,austrian airlines,9,the meal was very good,boarding in venice started with a short delay flight to vienna was a short however pleasant experience a decent snack was served accompanied by austrian wines fas were very friendly only minor point was the fact that once again the plane was not at a gate in vienna despite the bus transfers were ok flight to brussels was very good despite the delay on this flight a hot meal was served with a cake as dessert the meal was very good good austrian wines as well the purser and her assistant on this flight were exceptional a more than decent business experience in europe for sure my best european flight so far during this year
12562,jetstar pacific,7,fine for the money,my flight was the last one on this day at phu quoc airport because online checkin wasnt available for this flight i had to use the checkin at the airport no problem there they even gave me a seat near the emergency exit without asking for it the boarding was a bit of a problem at the estimated boarding time the gate was closed and i didnt got informed about any delays there were some announcements but only on vietnamese after like half an hour after the estimated boarding time the boarding suddenly started and the plane take off with a threequarter hour delay on board every thing was fine the cabine staff was kindly and could speak an understandable english all in all the flight was totally fine for the money i reached my destination and the delay wasnt big of a problem for me
2924,air tahiti nui,4,economy seat comfort was more domestic,budget is a word that comes to mind for air tahiti nui the bora bora a340 plane is in need of an update asap on board entertainment unit was small and quite a few were very fuzzy choice is okay but not like bigger players provide and the interface unit is via wii style hand held unit it is not an on demand service so when the movies start you need to be ready because of this it takes some of the gloss flying with them take a tablet mac laptop when flying air tahiti nui to avoid disappointment also have a device that can last 9 hours as there are no charging ports the other plane we flew in their fleet had a larger tablet screen and usb port for charging the crew did what they needed to do but nothing more unless you buzzed them or fly business class seat comfort in economy was more domestic than international quality and at 3 hour mark it becomes noticeable the armrests dont fold right up out of the way either food fussy eaters and kids take snacks as meals make par but thats it and bread rolls need a chainsaw to cut them open
18732,south african airways,8,positives offset the negatives,new york to johannesburg with south african airways the legroom on our 15 hour flight was excellent the crew were the friendliest i have experienced the flight left and arrived on time on the southbound flight the audio was not working the window had so much condensation i was unable to enjoy the views and the window shade was filthy however the route map kept me entertained we were well fed a generous lunch stroganoff pasta salad cheese cheesecake and a snickers bar excellent halfway a smoked chicken sandwich and a prelanding cheese pancake breakfast with fruit yoghurt and a croissant the positives offset the negatives and the time passed by i was able to sleep a little overall i enjoyed the flight and the fact that we flew nonstop we saved over 10 hours by doing so on our return flight the entertainment worked on my row but not in the row behind me where my friend was sitting also a wonderful friendly crew we left on time and arrived 40 minutes early i enjoyed both flights and was impressed by the legroom the food and the crews however flying out of johannesburg they are fussy with luggage weight we were 25 kilos overweight on one suitcase and the check in agent made a fuss about it asking me why i had so much stuff when i told her i would pay for the excess luggage she told me she did not know how to calculate the extra fee she told me i would be excused this time
4669,asiana airlines,3,selection of movies meagre,food wise it was bleah to meh but palatable the fa were quite fast to attend to general request the ife screen was small and the selection of movies was meagre but with the small screen with poor resolution my handphone samsung note 3 provided better entertainment if i wanted to use it i preordered an item for duty free purchase for my wife on the prior flight and supposed to collect it on this flight however they said there was a mistake made by the fa on the prior flight who helped make our preorder the response that i got was please call us when you reach your destination and we will sort it out what call i told them they should try to rectify it on their end and when we disembark why arent the fa trained properly it could have been better managed

5147,ba cityflyer,7,onboard service was laughable,cabin crew were friendly and polite delayed 2hrs due to chaos at edi on the outbound however the onboard service was laughable 86ml of water and a miniature packet of crisps described as light snack very light had the audacity to announce it was complimentary i know there are supply issues as well detailed in the media but that was a joke
12133,jet2com,8,very comfortable flight,stansted to antalya very comfortable flight food is very good and cabin crew were very friendly boarding started on time and our flight was on time however for a 34 hour flight there was no entertainment
19824,tap portugal,1,an absolute nightmare,an absolute nightmare from the beginning till the end 8 hours delay on the inbound 7 hours on the outbound missed connecting flights due to sheer incompetence of crew and rude ground staff in lisbon had to pay for hotel room due to very late arrival in newark and a new ticket for the domestic flight that i had missed whats more business class food is horrible and seats are anything but comfortable i should have trusted the overwhelmingly negative reviews of previous customers and for sure will never ever again this airline
22939,xiamen airlines,3,no personal tv,cebu to xiamen return economy food ok service okay but no personal tv business class food ok service good but still no personal tv i was given an ipad to watch movies
2308,air mauritius,6,business class seat does not lie flat,return flight from london to mauritius in business class friendly welcoming staff on the whole and good service good food and excellent champagne and wine offerings the main issue is the business class seat which does not lie flat and leads to interrupted sleep business customers have access to the skyteam lounge at heathrow which is excellent the lounge at mauritius is reasonable but the food offerings there are poor
3968,alitalia,2,worst flight i have had,rome to athens this must be the worst flight i have ever had one of the most uncomfortable planes i have ever been on rude air hostesses which where talking down to passengers and giggling all through the flight at the back of the plane i am surprised they are still allowed to fly with such service and state of aircraft only positive in the whole trip was the ground staff service at transfer desk
3860,alaska airlines,3,used to genuinely care about its customers,alaska airlines used to be my go to airline i have been a loyal customer since 2009 i would fly other airlines only when i had to anymore ak air could be compared with spirit airline but more expensive i never used to worry about delays cancellations lost baggage or rude staff however now i can honestly say expect all of those things with every trip ak air used to genuinely care about its customers but that is no longer the case
14312,lynx air,2,what an inexcusable delay,first time flying today and what an inexcusable delay they were understaffed and waiting for crew member this was a poor coordination on the airline original departure delayed less than 3 hours which could have been a basis for compensation if more than 3 hours yet there were no offer of food or drinks 2 hours of lost time just sitting in the airport
5504,batik air,6,it is such a hassle,first time flying with batik air from kuala lumpur to jakarta and it is such a hassle you have to check in at the counter since online check in is unavailable during checkin at the counter the queue is unorganized which caused confusion i needed at least 30 minutes to just to get checkedin during the flight the seat was okay and looked dull the seat incline is the same as other lowcost airlines seat during meal time there are no options and i received pizza like bread and a muffin with a cup of mineral water it is terrible
5175,ba cityflyer,9,impressed with the meal service,madrid to amsterdam via london city airport very good flights with ba cityflyer legroom and comfort on the embraer were good and i was impressed with the meal service from madrid to london a choice of meal tray with cold salad and desert was offered and on every flight a second drink was offered crew was young but very professional and polite transfer at lcy was not great we had to leave the airport and reenter in just 45 minutes

8229,eastern airways,7,eastern airways customer review,leedsbradford to southampton plane was about halffull which seems fairly typical from the other reviews price was higher than flybe but my employer paid everyone else also looked to be travelling on business ie noone else would have been paying the fare themselves either i suspect eastern should be ok with the financial numbers if they can charge high amounts and halffill the plane this would be equivalent to quite a high loading 80 at flybe prices flight itself was good helpful stewardess a very professional outfit excellent that they offer free fasttrack at lba ideal for an early morning flight speaking of which they fly to southampton earlier in the morning than flybe which again is useful its also a really handy route leeds to the south coast

6608,cathay pacific airways,5,a very disappointing experience,cathay pacifics premium economy left much to be desired cabin crew were not attentive to passengers needs after serving the first meal cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 or so hours of the long flight from vancouver to hong kong no special drinks were offered to premium economy passengers and only standard snacks chocolate bars granola bars peanuts etc were offered upon request the boeing 777300 er cabin is particularly noisy seems it is due to noisy ceiling fans it was a fully booked flight and cabin crew were clearly overwhelmed by the number of passengers on board the aisles are very narrow on the boeing 777 aircraft since cathay is now cramming 10 across seating in economy so passengers can easily be run over and injured by meal and beverage carts overall it was a very disappointing experience with cathay it is not the premium airline it used to be and from what ive experienced it may never be
5202,ba cityflyer,8,ba cityflyer customer review,lcyedilcy operated by ba cityflyer excellent flights on the embraer e170 out e190 back on time departure and early arrivals on both legs complimentary hot breakfast on outbound leg passable at best bar service with a sweet or salty snack on the return more than enough for the 1 hour 10 minute flight friendly crew nice modern jets lcy was busy on the outbound but the airport had opened the overflow ie former screening haul and it took all of 10 minutes from dlr to airside edinburgh busy on the return but queues well managed accessed ba terraces lounge in edinburgh courtesy of my gold card with cathay pacific which was uncrowded with a reasonable selection of food and drink all in all very good
6227,buddha air,8,buddha air did a good job,the airport in kathmandu is chaotic but buddha air did a good job if you dont want to do hiking in the himalayas you should definitely take the flight our flight was delayed due to weather reasons but once we took off the flight crew did an amazing job the only two concerns with the airline i have are the safety and the reliability as i am not certain if the international standards apply here
18051,silkair,7,friendly and efficient,singapore to kota kinabalu my first experience of the silkair b737800 product boarding was by zone number and uncomplicated i had the luxury of an empty seat next to me so that made a difference when i took my seat first impression was of fairly simple but cleanlooking cabin environment seat backs were sculpted plastic and very basic with only the tray table and a deep plastic pocket to lose your belongings in the b737 always strikes me as a rather more cramped cabin than the a320 and so it turned out when checking seatguru with 1 inch less pitch and seat width than the a320 we were given cool towelettes and offered newspapers before takeoff and a hot meal appeared chicken spaghetti which proved a bit difficult to eat for obvious reasons entertainment is available by the silkair studio and the choice of music proved disappointingly poor although more movies appeared available service was generally friendly and efficient and we landed feeling at least half human
20483,thomson airways,5,legroom was extremely tight,recently flew thomson as part of a package from manchester to las palmas and must say the flight was the most uncomfortable i have been on the plane looked lovely from the outside but was filthy and visibly old inside with bits of trim missing along with tears in seats etc the legroom was extremely tight must worse than say thomas cook and ryanair crew where there to sell sell sell having made 6 announcements each lasting 46 minutes of hard selling and special one time offers that were also available on the way home but has a different offer airline also charges credit card fee for onboard purchases so if you are planning on purchasing items onboard instead of at the airport you would need to factor this in
23073,xl airways france,8,xl airways france customer review,xl airways france is a charter airline that has recently entered the us market i flew sfo to cdg nonstop and paid 500 less per person than i would have on air france thats considerable savings i read you get what you pay for well i happen to have flown air france also and they are no different than xl airways france the economy in xlf is very similar to air france with the exception of ife individual screens you get two meals on a 10 hour flight a warm meal after take off and a cold meal before landing one my first leg i upgraded to premium economy for a measly 39 the only difference is a few extra inches of leg room barely noticeable and leather seats you still dont get individual screens only in galaxie class or first class crew is extremely friendly and bilingual
20908,transavia,5,not always low on cost,amsterdam to thessaloniki i travel frequently to greece to visit my family and i use transavia since its the only direct flight to my hometown out of amsterdam i am generally happy with the service since i do know what to expect although for the record it is not always low on cost
20746,titan airways,1,staff friendly and professional,rhodes to birmingham we would just like to say a big thank you to all the crew on our aircraft from rhodes to birmingham that brought us back on the 29th september due to thomas cook not trading anymore the staff was so friendly and professional thank you once again
6114,british airways,4,downright rude and abusive,obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really dont need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldnt want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious
10355,germania airline,3,i will never fly germania again,the flight from gatwick to skiathos was 1 hour late taking off which was irritating but not a disasterthe return journey was of a 6 hour duration which was as shown on the ticket except that having taken off from skiathos we travelled to thessaloniki for refuelling then announced there was a delay at gatwick which meant a 30 minute further delay after 30 minutes a further 25 minute delay we were left without a drink for 5 hours the crew citing equipment breakdown etc all of the time the captain was appologising for the delays but on the approach and landing announced that we had arrived on time is this because it costs more to deplane people rather them keeping them in the refuelling area i will never fly with germania again
4878,avelo airlines,1,horrible customer service,this airline has horrible customer service they made me pay for a carry on with a backpack that was not even questioned on the way down to fort myers do not fly this airline they do not care about their customers and charge unnecessary fees not worth saving money on a ticketbecause you dont terrible experience
11032,hong kong airlines,6,surprisingly nice and attentive,auckland to hong kong flight was quite expensive but i had to book it last minute and no other options were available as this was the christmasnew year period i arrived well intime for checkin at auckland airport scheduled departure was 1015 am and i arrived just before 8 am online checkin was not available for this flight no reason given only two counters opened for checkin at the airport for hong kong airlines there was already a long queue for what it looked like was a very full flight and the line was getting longer behind me as well checkin process took awfully long the three ground staff were slow rude and unapologetic i was still waiting for my turn at the scheduled boarding time of 930 am they had to rush the last 20 or so passengers for checkin and rudely told us to run to the gate or well miss the flight no priority was given at security and no airport carts were used to transport us to the gate i doublechecked both at checkin and at boardinggate with staff to ensure both my checkin bags were on the flight considering the checkin was hectic i was assured both times that my bags were on the plane we finally made it onto the aircraft and departed almost 30 minutes late plane and seats were old but nevertheless comfortable i had a window seat at the back of the plane curtains and interior were a warm red colour cabincrew were surprisingly nice and attentive leg room was sufficient and i managed to get an empty seat next to me food was delicious toilets clean and the helpyourselfminibar at the back of the plane made the difference ife was mediocre not a lot of choice but sufficient arrived in hong kong 20 minutes ahead of schedule i went to the transfer desk in hong kong airport to make my jet airways connecting flight here they advised me and some of my fellow passengers that due to late checkin at auckland out bags werent loaded onto the aircraft and they will be coming on the next flight after i arrived at mumbai it took 5 days for them to deliver the bag to my mumbai address after countless calls and emails overall not a bad flight but they need a more efficient checkin process to ensure all passengers that arrived on time are checkedin on time by the ground staff and ready to board at least before the schedule boarding time
7175,citilink,6,low cost airline buy onboard,citilink low cost airline flight from jakarta to denpasar it was delayed 30 minutes and the flight to denpsasar took about 1h 30 min they didnt offer anything complimentary being a low cost airline it is buy onboard
6537,cathay dragon,7,i was very impressed,chiang mai to hong kong this was the first time choosing this company and it was just great everything was efficient since i entered the airport staff was warm welcoming and helpful the seat was not the best but still comfy enough food was great bearing in mind it was a short haul nice presentation of the food on the way from hong kong our plane broke so we had to wait for another one however the staff took care of us very efficiently i was very impressed and will fly with them again if possible
4673,asiana airlines,8,overall experience is good,manila to seattle via seoul incheon on a350 and b777 a350 is quite new and their boeing 777 seems old food services are really excellent they are constantly offering drinks during the entire flight wide variety of drink options leg room are very decent for an economy class however avod is limited and they should have more options overall experience is good will definitely choose asiana again when flying long haul to usa
14881,montenegro airlines,8,montenegro airlines customer review,initgdlgw flight from ni to podgorica by fokker 100 in fairly good condition although leather seats had seen better days plenty of leg room flight attendants friendly and came round with a drinks run podgorica to lgw also a fokker 100 less leg room and some seats were broken a drinks run and sandwich offered about 40 minutes into the flight the captain explained that there was a problem and would have to refuel in ljubljana on the ground for 45 minutes and then onto lgw another drink run after leaving ljubljana crew were attentive and friendly
14490,malaysia airlines,7,a reasonable flight,kullhr on 20 october in economy plus which means extra legroom in front of the economy cabin boarding in kl was well managed and the aircraft left on time the cabin crew were pretty much absent on boarding but the purser of the flight was very amiable and friendly and went out of his way to greet passengers and chat to them a shout to rufus the purser who even lent me his personal charging cord and plug when mine failed he went out of his way to assist cabin service was efficient but staff didnt really interact with the passengers but remained pleasant and cheerful the ife was poor big screens good resolution but disappointing content the seat was comfortable and there was plenty of legroom the food was awful very small portions and not tasty their signature nasi lemak was very disappointing but they did serve two full meals and one minuscule tuna roll midflight the fas kept is well watered but alcohol choices were poor and not made clear to passengers overall this was a reasonable flight and everything went smoothly apart from the food which could be much better
15810,pegasus airlines,3,abysmal start of a vacation,worst flight ive ever been on abysmal start of a vacation i dont think the point of a budget airline is to absolutely humiliate and treat passengers like animals to start off our flight was delayed an unacceptable 4 hours at the gate without any explanation and it is still not clear why it got delayed to top things off when they let us into the plane they told us to expect an additional hour of delay in the plane seated in the most uncomfortable seats and now one hour has passed with no news as to why all the delaying
20230,thai smile airways,8,cabin crew is very nice,cabin crew is very nice comfortable seat domestic flight take about 12 hrs they provided snack during flight seat section no additional charge and free 20kg load
21088,tunisair,2,avoid if possible,after more than three flights both internally and internationally that have been delayed significantly with tunis air i warn about the perils of flying with this airline unfortunately there is very little accountability or care to the needs of customers and it has become normal to experience delays without receiving any or very little information i have had flights delayed between 2 to 8 hours and have come to expect delays all the time its painful and frustrating each time i dont understand how this airline remains in business with such poor punctuality record and customer service sadly theres very little competition thus it continues to trap customers if you have no choice but to take tunis air just plan for delays and dont plan connecting flights without a significant amount of time previewed for delays avoid if possible
10192,garuda indonesia,9,impressed with the level of service,overall i was impressed with the level of service and attention to detail the seats were comfortable and the cabin was clean additionally the inflight entertainment system was easy to use from the checkin counter to the cabin crew everyone was courteous and helpful i felt that the safety of passengers was a top priority however during first service the snack was disappointing potentially because i requested special meal hindu non vegetarian i only received an apple while the others received lukewarm bread roll with a meat filling fortunately the second service was delicious bonus points for offering real cutlery in economy class it was a pleasant experience they only have to elevate their food and beverage service by offering more frequent and bigger portionstray in addition offering snacks in between would be greatly appreciated
18064,silkair,5,ground staff were very helpful,colombo to singapore on the 737 was acceptable given the duration of the flight as a regional carrier however silkair fails to meet the mark aircraft had dirt on the seat catering was barely palatable but acceptable given the regional status service nothing special with some staff being nicer than the others ground staff at both ends were very helpful
6588,cathay pacific airways,6,overall a good experience,flight overall was not bad though the seats were cramped and legroom was tight the cabin crew told my mom there were water bottles in the back near the restrooms but there wasnt there were just snacks overall a good experience
11072,hong kong airlines,5,a pretty poor effort,flew hong kong airlines from hong kong to bangkok the exterior of the plane was very dirty the interior was very red and upon embarkation and disembarkation there was cheesy asian music playing out of the tannoy system the interior was rather old and there was no inflight entertainment on board this actual aircraft the food was pretty poor with just a sausage roll being offered every time the captain put on the seat belt sign the cabin crew would march down the aisle making sure that everyone was wearing their seatbelts they refused to serve any joy drinks during this time compared to cathy pacific this was a pretty poor effort
6808,central mountain air,9,central mountain air customer review,only four people on my flight so we sat where we liked checking in was therefore a formality as it was a small propeller plane it felt like getting on a private jet albeit quite worn inside and shared with others no cabin crew on board no need for a 45 min journey to edmonton its cheaper than its bigger rivals offering a more personal service as you would expect for a local airline and certainly a better option than taking the coach professional and efficient so would use again
17956,shenzhen airlines,7,shenzhen airlines customer review,wuh to ckg on an a320 flight on time even a little early clean cabin appearance seat pitch good foodsnack a little disappointment nothing salty just sweets fa in good mood and friendly
5742,blue islands,5,blue islands customer review,i have been impressed with the three blue islands flights i have been on in the last couple of years from guernsey to alderney and twice to jersey the lounge service in guernsey is excellent and all the staff very friendly and professional my passport which i accidentally left on the plane this week following a flight to jersey this week was retrieved quickly and given back to me in the arrivals hall which i was very pleased about
11330,icelandair,8,flight to zurich was uneventful,keflavk to zurich in saga class despite its uneven standards icelandair provides the most comfortable experience for travel between iceland and europe it is perhaps the only airline that provides something like a premium experience in business class for intereurope travel the saga lounge at keflavk airport is among the better lounges of its type checkin and boarding at keflavk went without any glitch priority boarding was honoured the new 737 max is noticeably quieter than its earlier versions the flight to zurich was uneventful we had requested an indianasian vegetarian meal but what was served had indianasian missing from it but for a 3 hours flight no big deal wifi is included in the saga class ticket on icelandair when it works it is the best internet connection in the sky
7275,cityjet,5,cityjet customer review,london city to dublin first time using cityjet and london city airport a great little airline booking the fare it was refreshing to see that the amount you first see is the amount you actually end up paying ie no extra charges not even a handling charge which is effectively a charge for nothing my trip to the airport did not go to plan and i ended up at the airport ten minutes before departure they advertise that you can check in up to ten minutes before departure at city and sure enough the staff got me on that flight although checkin had just closed the staff at the ticket counter were helpful i had already checked in online but needed to have my boarding card printed then one of them ran with me to the gate given the reduction in service levels across most airlines in recent years i couldnt believe this flight was fine pleasant crew complementary sandwich and bar service the crew came through the cabin several times offering drinks smaller aircraft made for easier boarding and disembarkation london city a great little airport with no distance between the checkin area and the train station overall this was a great experience compared to heathrow or gatwick and the actions of the staff that evening saved me a lot of money and stress in getting me on that flight i would have had to pay for a new flight and overnight at a hotel and missed half a days work otherwise
15503,oman air,1,not fair in such a crisis,i want to thank oman air for charging extra as per the ticket policy in such a situation all uae borders are closed my flight supposed to be on sunday 22nd march i called to extend my stay the contact center agent said i have to pay the change fees 13 omani rial this is totally ridiculous and not fair in such a crisis
12137,jet2com,9,plane was fairly new,birmingham to lanzarote the flight out and return were both excellent we were boarded 20 minutes early so we had an earlier slot the plane was fairly new and comfortable the staff were friendly and helpful we arrived half an hour early which was great the return flight was just as good
16123,play,9,planes are as clean as can be,brand new airbus planes that are as clean as can be friendly cabin crew and ground staff the departure time out of iceland is not the best but its understandable that they are given the worst timing slots as being the newcomer on the market
15417,olympic air,1,olympic air customer review,economy class lhrathefl a320 dash 8400 a huge improvement over the old olympic airlines lhrath on a new aircraft more than adequate legroom a decent hot meal served with complimentary beverages motivated hard working and smiling crew athefl was equally good with a snack and beverages on 45 minute flight
14142,lufthansa,3,basinet seat is overbooked,booking basinet seat has been the terrible experience we booked bassinet seat on february 2023 via their customer care and when we reached airport to board on april 2023 they told us that basinet seat is overbooked and we do not have the basinet seat same experience in the return flight too we had to fight at the counter for almost half an hour at the time of boarding to get us basinet seat at the end so it was never double booked but they lied to us also very bad experience with their coordination with partner airline their partner airline got cancelled and rescheduled but lufthansa did not update the itinerary i had to call them to update it but guess what on the day before flying they randomly cancelled our booking again with the partner airline overall i spent about 10 hours in one week fixing the airline reservation issue as well as basinet issue will never book with airline ever again
19213,sun country airlines,2,charge me for my computer 60,i was flying from msp to bwi i had my carryon and my computer sun country agent decided to charge me for my computer 60 since im traveling this is a first time i have an issue with my computer my wife was telling me that this company is the worst in the usa i realize this in fact
2623,air niugini,2,air niugini customer review,one of the worst airlines i have ever flown with of course you can not expect much in a country like papua new guinea overall i had six domestic flights all were delayed by at least one hour all planes were in a disappointing condition the cleanliness was poor the crew were rude incompetent and not very service oriented
14615,mandarin airlines,8,mandarin airlines customer review,decided to fly this route to mainland china instead of my usual hkg flew from tsaknh return on what seemed to be a new embraer e195 this airline is the domestic offshoot for china airlines and the english language version of their website is a simple cut and paste from the international airline however the baggage allowance for domestic taiwanese flights is only 10kg so i had to really point out that the english information states 20kg and after some trouble i was able to fly without having to pay extra despite that the actual flight to and from kinmen was quick comfortable and care free only a snack and water was served on the flight but it was only 50 minutes long so it was not an issue i was pleased to have been given the emergency exit row on both flights too handy being the taller westerner that i am except for the baggage allowance issue i can not find fault with them
16852,rossiya airlines,4,rossiya airlines customer review,helsinki to st petersburg short flight 2hrs or so seat pitch was fine plane was exceptionally old still had ash trays smelt of musky smoke must have been flying in the 1960s flight staff dont speak english only russian which was ok no need to talk to them flight was delayed by an hour or so due to snow actual flight was a bit scary never been scared on any flight before but rossiya air brings about a whole new flying experience i probably would fly them again if i was desperate or on a tight budget otherwise fly ba or finnair
4565,arkefly,1,arkefly customer review,flight to curacao in economy class i never had such a bad flight with unfriendly staff the one free meal was bad for the rest you have to pay seat was very narrow for menever again with arkefly
6572,cathay dragon,9,very spacious and good ife,phuket to hong kong new terminal in phuket and it is much better than before spacious and airy i missed the earlier thai airways flight and they directed me to the cathay dragon counter the staff was sympathetic but asked me to buy a ticket online instead of directly from them as it would be cheaper and it was indeed of very good value check in was done quickly as i was very early for that flight the ground staff also told me not to go inside too early as the lounge they use was not up to the usual standard as the proper one wasnt open yet very honest and good advice as i found out later it was merely a cordoned off area the flight was full but boarding was orderly with priorities well respected smiley flight attendants greeted all passengers and the economy class seats were the same as their bigger brother cathay pacific very spacious and good ife once level off the crew immediately served a hot dinner it consisted of a ham potato and cheese salad too creamy and a chicken curry rice which was served pipping hot and very delicious they came round with ice cream and tea later the whole meal service took less than 40 minutes very efficient call bells were answered promptly and the flight attendants were kept very busy on this full flight landing was on time but parked at the far end of the terminal despite that it took 25 minutes from disembarkation to collect bags to boarding the airport express train
14474,malaysia airlines,6,delayed at least 1hr,2 flights took from malaysia airlines today both delayed at least 1hr other than that their services are okay flight staff are friendly and helpful i hope they learn to value our time
22437,volotea,1,it is essentially impossible to speak with anybody,i am not complaining about the flight though the ticket was quite expensive my complaint is about the megavolotea programme i have never asked to joining such programme which is totaly useless for me however yesterday i received an email from volotea saying that i was now part of the programme and that volotea had taken the annual fee 5999 euro from my credit card all this without any previous communication or at least a request to confirm it i tried to contact volotea to clarify the matterit is essentially impossible to speak with anybody their sort of ai virtual assistant is a no go i tried to contact them over the phone very well hidden number but i found one and nobody replies i sent a few emails to all the volotea addresses i could find but no answer unspeakable behaviour my advice is to steer well away from such company and never give them your credit card number
8807,estonian air,2,estonian air customer review,cphtll return flights were delayed both ways no meals served and inflight service horrible due to staff fa onboard generally seem careless and are simply unable to smile
22355,volaris,2,charged my family over 600 dollars for the luggage,worst airline possible they are rude and dont care they charged my family over 600 dollars for the luggage that they already had paid for and not only that they charged my dads card 400 do not fly with them they dont care about anyone
8530,egyptair,4,refused to upgrade our seats,we were disappointed with the customer relations and handling of problems with our flight the plane was clean and comfortable and we received waters and hand sanitizer upon boarding however our flight to cairo from luxor was canceled two days before the flight while we were already on our trip in the case of our traveling companions they never received confirmation of their cancelation different flight a day later but same story the new flight they put us on would not work with our itinerary but after trying to get in touch with them at short notice none of their numbers worked we finally found a number that worked but they were unable to help us much they finally put us on an earlier flight the day before causing us to lose an entire day of our vacation but would not compensate us for a lost day of our itinerary after asking they refused to upgrade our seats they also would not let us check in online and so after arriving at the airport we found out the new flight they put us on is not even a direct flight and was a multistop flight back to cairo now we must find a hotel or place to stay in cairo for the night since we are getting in 25 hours earlier than our itinerary while this is obviously not the companys fault this demonstrates a lack of hospitality and willingness to help make a bad situation easier on us due to their cancelations this also shows that multiple people over multiple days were unwilling to help us in any way
10303,georgian airways,1,dont take this airline,gatwick to tbilisi hilariously poor and incompetent airline even though we were the only flight leaving gatwick past 11pm somehow they managed to delay the flight by 1 hour due to a busy airport which was obviously just an excuse as we saw that the pilots and staff hadnt made their way onboard until 5 mins after the flight was scheduled to leave even though it was a flight from london to georgia the staff didnt speak english beyond conversational during the delay we had no communication or offer of anything to keep us warm in the aircraft that had the air con on at midnight during the flight the staff seemed completely uncaring and incompetent of the people on board even though it is cheap dont take this airline
15449,oman air,1,left us in the airport in the middle of the night,airline moved the flight schedule and then promised overnight hotel due to the 1 day layover then they lied about providing accommodation and left us in the airport in the middle of the night the airline website does not allow you to get any refunds as it goes in a loop this is an airline with no customer service and has staff that do not care never going to fly them again
8913,ethiopian airlines,4,they informed me a pcr was required,i flew from cape town to dubai via ethiopia the dubai government website states a pcr test can be completed on arrival in dubai when i checked in at cape town airport ethiopian airport staff did not request a covid test to board my first leg to ethiopia however i was denied boarding in ethiopia as they informed me a pcr was required i was forced to spend 2 days in ethiopia waiting for a pcr test which was costly i understand requirements need to be met but im deeply dissatisfied that the pcr wasnt requested to board in cape town as the airline were well aware of my entire journey and end destination when i raised the matter with the airline their only response was that it was mentioned on their website
7086,china southern airlines,8,calmed me down with excellent service,first leg of the flight sha can was cancelled within 24 hours before the departure from shanghai to los angeles via guangzhou but somehow i made it in time from shanghai to guangzhou by taking an earlier flight to catch my long haul flight from guangzhou to los angeles on may 15 2021 though it was not a smooth trip due to the unexpected sudden flight cancellation but luckily i was impressed during this trip with the ground staff of china southern airlines at guangzhou international airport who checked in me and calmed me down with excellent service
8431,edelweiss air,9,edelweiss air customer review,round trip to canary islands on this swiss airline clean aircraft friendly and efficient fas good info from the flight deck deserves a 4 star ranking
3563,airbaltic,3,more attention to ground service,brussels to riga planes are mainly comfortable and crew onboard is nice and friendly food and beverages what you can buy onboard is also good flying is good and comfortable but checkin and boarding are below average i have been flying all over the world the last 10 years so i share my last experience with air baltic my flight from brussels to riga should depart 955 reallife we depart 1015 not so big deal we arrived on time i was 0730 in the airport to do checkin after my arrive checkin just opened before me was 9 persons to checkin then i was next in line and checkin lady was replaced the new lady lost her id card so she was unable to do any checkins so lady before and the new lady walked away and they only say somebody will be here so finally checkin was done they check in 10 persons with one hour then i go shopping and then boarding was announced and everyone told to be quick so we can depart on time never heard that kind of announcements before may by air baltic you change your boarding system it is unacceptable to say that kind off announcement in my opinion i have used air baltic before 4 times and every single time i had some issues in checkin it looks like that their checkin and ground service is really below average so also we wait for 1 hrs for our checkin luggage at riga airport so if you are ready to deal all that crap before the flight for lowcost flights i recommend air baltic i rate planes and comfort on flight 4 but ground service 1 so the total score is 2 if they but more attention to ground service i think they will be a much better airline air baltic first opinion is most important i hope that in future if i use your service again i get a better experience
16013,philippine airlines,5,long and messy check in process,disappointed with the flagship airlines of a country the aircraft is very small and seats are not comfortable food on the flights are also not very good long and messy check in process
238,aer lingus,6,fas were helpful but firm,nothing to write home about seats were a bit cramped food tasted bland no free alcoholic beverages on my flight which i had previously assumed was standard on trans atlantic flights but maybe i am mistaken fas were helpful but firm ife options left some to be desired we got these tickets for 400 less than the closest competitor however so i suppose we definitely got what we paid for dublin airport transfer was painless and second leg dublin to paris was a short breeze
11885,japan airlines,9,impressed with the improvement,helsinki to tokyo narita it is 10 years since i flew jal and i was very impressed with the improvement charming ground staff in helsinki and the crew have their mojo back and were faultless despite a full flight the meal was good and it was nice to get flavoured steamed spinach as the salad instead of the standard offering my only negative would be the ife choice the cabin temperature was perfect despite usual all comments about heat
1526,air dolomiti,7,air dolomiti customer review,flight lh9444 from munich to bergamo orio al serio seating 8c economy class the short trip was really good and inexpensive on board the seating was comfortable and the legroom was perfect also service on board was good but one hostess was impolite the only negative note

17237,rwandair,2,rwandair customer review,wb300 kgl to dbx 14 november 2012 my boarding time was at 1115 nothing had happened by 1215 so i started to get a bit nervous inquired with airport representatives who was sitting at the boarding gate they said they dont know what was happening and would check i found that to be quite unprofessional they should have known there were complications they came back 30 mins later to advise us that they apologize for the delay and will advise accordingly flight left after 300 that morning i really think rwandair team in kigali needs to be trained accordingly its just good manners to keep your passengers informed on things like this
16453,qantaslink,9,very pleasant flight,townsville to brisbane checkin was done with ease and boarding was completed in a easy and timely manner travelled on the 8pm service and departed on time as always a very pleasant flight on the qantaslink 717 smooth quiet and with entertainment supplied the food service was acceptable the serving could be larger but was not left starving cabin crew were polite and approachable arrived ahead of schedule as advised by the wonderful flight deck crew

2050,air koryo,2,air koryo customer review,not as lucky as the last writer here travelled on an ancient ilyushin aircraft and whilst happy to reach my destination this is not an airline i would use again no choice this time on my schedule to pyongyang this plane was not maintained well from the surface appearance in the cabin and many seat mechanisms also were broken cabin staff had a fixed smile on boarding and whilst they gave out a meal tray they could not speak or understand english and appeared to rather poorly trained food was as expected i guess but the quality was well below all asian airlines i have ever flown and think it was the cheapest meal ever sampled on a plane

16952,royal air maroc,1,ignore their customers,on my flight from marrakech to gatwick via casablanca the flight was consistently delayed and we were given no information the attendants at the gate either ran away from passengers who were asking what was happening were rude to them or ignored us they assured us we would not miss our connecting flight to london as soon as we arrived in casablanca we were met with zero help and told all flights to london had left for the day again desk agents were incredibly rude ignoring people begging for help i am 300 pounds out of pocket paying for their mistakes they refuse to get in touch with me via email or any other means they ignore their customers never fly them not a single apology was offered to me

22209,vivaaerobs,1,worst airline i have ever experienced,this is the worst airline i have ever experienced the customer service is atrocious i arrived in plenty of time to board my flight the online check in service wasnt working which staff admitted had been a problem all day and so i needed to obtain my boarding pass i waited in this ridiculously long line and arrived with more than an hour until my flight customer service told me i could not check in despite not having checked baggage they continued to tell me i was too late this is more than hour before my flight leaves we continued arguing until 50 mins before my plane would leave and they refused to help me told me i could not have a refund but i could purchase a new ticket to leave 2 days later i had more than enough time to board the plane still and they would not do anything for me i had to cover the costs of a hotel and a new flight with a different airline the next day costing me hundreds i emailed in to discuss this with the company and they again just refused to help me awful customer service and i will never use them again
6439,caribbean airlines,5,major room for improvement,quite a mediocre airline with a semigood landside operation and quite a good airside one the good counter service is good quick and efficient checkin with friendly enough agents tickets are easy to purchase online or at their offices the aircraft are in good condition seats are clean if basic pitch is more than other carriers free sealed airbuds attendants are accommodating well trained and efficient each seat has a free to take caribbean beat magazine imho the best caribbean publication the meals and drinks are still complimentary and of high quality for an airline safety is paramount the airline has a good compliment of flight officers and properly maintained aircraft the bad the website is very dated changes cannot be made leading to dont try to contact the airline responses to emails take well over 5 days sometimes months the call centre seems to be bogged down seat pitch could be better im 511 and its comfortable until the person in front decides to recline there is very little entertainment a complimentary movie on those tiny dropdown screens that even lifetime wont show and some audio channels the ugly its the only airline apart from aa where one gets grumpy fas again communication is horrible all in all not the worst but there is major room for improvement particularly landside operations
20700,tigerair australia,1,overall a nightmare experience,brisbane to sydney travelled with a 6 month old baby and this was the worst service ever experienced some of the young ladies employed at brisbane airport service desk demonstrated zero customer service on our trip to sydney they were sarcastic extremely rude and showed no understanding of what was helpful to a travelling family ive done 8 flights with my daughter on other airlines and this short flight with tigerair was by far the worst and left me in tears we also had white stains on the seats in the plane overall a nightmare experience tiger need to train their brisbane front of house staff in customer service
20927,transavia,5,no sandwiches available,faro to eindhoven left about half an hour late due to an oil spillage on the runway not a fault of the airline new aircraft with modern sky interior very tight and rockhard seating which led to an uncomfortable flight and back pain table was filthy completely covered in coffee stains on the front and back asked the steward for a wet cloth and cleaned it ourselves flight departed at 1830 no sandwiches whatsoever available the plane had already made a return flight that day and catering was apparently not replenished also warm cheese sandwiches were sold out so very little food items to choose from which is unexceptable crew advised the passengers to send a complaint to customer services perhaps transavia can also think of adding or changing their catering assortment onboard beacuse it has been more or less the same especially the sandwiches for at least the past 10 years a warm meal like other lccs or even tui offer for purchase could be an idea also considering transvia flies to far away destinations like dubai cabin crew were friendly and flight calm and uneventful but transavia could make some effort in providing a better onboard experience
5937,breeze airways,3,would not recommend,incredible kind staff but absolute garbage experience flight delayed initially two hours because plane stuck on east coast then when it arrived we had to deplane to reboot computer on plane now an additional 25 hrs late arrived at 115am providence and still waiting as of 215am for baggage to show up due to staffing issues would not recommend
21760,virgin america,8,the flight was very good,san francisco to san diego virgin seems not to have the super positive attitude that alaska has the passion and enthusiasm seems to be waning the airline is nonetheless leaps and bounds better than united or american or even southwest the aircraft was clean and comfortable the snacks and beverages were topnotch the staff however seemed to be distant and indifferent this is the opposite of alaska where the staff is so passionate and helpful the departure and arrival were prompt and punctual all in all the flight was very good i just wish the staff seemed to be more connected and not so apathetic
8440,edelweiss air,5,edelweiss air customer review,athzrh in economy class surprised to fly on a swiss flight operated by edelweiss but more surprised and charmed by the excellent quality of service friendly crew the hot food was exceptional
5807,blue1,5,blue1 customer review,helrvnhel md90 the plane was new clean and with large seats the crew was very professional and polite either in helsinki and rovaniemi we arrived ahead of scheduled i recommend this airline even if sometimes the fares are not really lowcost
6295,bulgaria air,7,bulgaria air customer review,i flew on 20 december 2014 on bulgaria air from vienna to sofia given other reviews about this airline i was concerned about flying bg air at first and was in the end decently surprised about the flight my flight was operated by an airbus a319 the flight attendants were extremely kind and helpful yet spoke below average english the food on board consisted of an extremely tasty sandwich accompanied by a chocolate as dessert which was also tasty two rounds of drinks were served on this flight the flight was full and uneventful the aircraft required better cleaning overall id fly bulgaria air again but they really need to improve their services on board as well as other minor products despite their cheap airfares
1077,air berlin,5,i wish they had been nicer,bought my ticket one day in advance for 122 from berlin tegel to dusseldorf which was a very good deal i got to the airport early to check my bag and the guy told me my fare didnt include a checked bag fair enough he gave me a paper slip and had me go to the ticket sales office to pay they in turn sent me somewhere that had no sign so they had to tell me again where to go after finally being able to complete the transaction i went and got my bag tag the agent wasnt friendly and welcoming only functional the line to get through security was long and the waiting area tiny but thats all about tegel airport not air berlin boarding was fairly haphazard but they got the job done in time for departure we took off and landed a bit early with the lights off most of the way to dus as it was an early morning flight the flight attendants literally ran the cart through the aisle and sold drinks to maybe 3 passengers got my bag at dus mission accomplished but i wish they had been nicer
7821,csa czech airlines,2,service below standard,moscow to prague service below standard flew csa business class from moscow to prague all aspects of the service was not in line with what is normally offered in business class and definitively much below what direct competitor is offering it is in terms of the overall customer care comfort of the seats selection of the meal in fact there was no selection etc i found csa business class only marginally better than lufthansa or austrian economy though significantly more expensive not a value for money
5796,blue1,6,blue1 customer review,short trip arlanda to helsinki very nice people working on board cold but nice meal nice experience
10434,germanwings,8,germanwings customer review,29th july 2013 london heathrow to cologne flight 4u461 i checked in online for the flight as instructed on their website and then went to the airport bag drop the queue was very long and only one lady was in charge of the entire queue she understandably looked stressed flight was on an a319 and the seats were comfortable enough for a short trip a snack was offered for sale as this airline is a budget airline but one which allows for through baggage i picked this airline for my trip down to italy partly based on price and partly based on the reputation of being the best of the lower price airlines the captain was informative and the crew seemed to be pleasant and very well turned out indeed during quite bad turbulence not enough was done to calm the fears of passengers arrival into cologne was a pleasure and the modern and friendly airport made for a good stop over on my way to italy i shall report my next flight in more detail in a separate report
21667,vietnam airlines,7,promising airline with dedicated staff,vietnam airlines is a promising airline with dedicated staff but there are a few operational and infrastructural issues that hold the airline back call center and website deficiencies need work however it redeems itself in the air my first interaction for this trip which was the website to manage my booking to select my seat and special meal request did not work as it was a delta ticket using miles so i did not get the best first impression subsequently i called the call center in vietnam to order my special meal and was informed that no meals were provided for both legs of my flight fast forward to the flight meals were served on both legs which left me vexed by the misinformation airport experience was standard but the employees didnt seem too well versed on the procedures as important ones such as making a boarding announcement and reassigning seats after ticket issuance seemed unfamiliar to the staff i also did not enjoy the double security i had to undergo since my itinerary had a connecting flight and needed to swap terminals when transiting in hanoi on the flipside the airline got some things right albeit being unable to order a special meal the standard ones served were fantastic there was even bubble tea sold for a modest 2 usd the inflight crew did a fine job not exceeding nor falling below expectations on this red eye flight and the entertainment had some good choices overall not a bad airline but they have some work to do with fine tuning staff training and fixing the poor website
1527,air dolomiti,9,air dolomiti customer review,psamuc in june 2014 in economy class flight left with 25mins delay due to a medical emergency on board spacious cabin in this nice embraer 195 aircraft refreshing towel for hands and face was offered before takeoff and after takeoff the meal service begun including a sandwich and drinks wine is offered in a real glass which is a bonus second time for me on this airline and truly to be recommended
10743,gulf air,9,lovely business class,bahrain to bangkok with gulf air lovely business class as soon as you find your seat they will greet you with a welcome drink chef will take the food order after amenity kit pjs available beds not that comfortable though overall kind staff roomy business class would fly with them again
7464,copa airlines,4,there was no one there,first we were rebooked for no known reason through a different country to get home so the travel time was going to be longer but that isnt the worst that happened the bigger problem was that coming back from our wedding my husband was asked if he could give up his extra seat as copa was overbooked he told them no because that is a comfort necessity for him after that conversation my husband started looking for other flights that we could take because he felt bad for the gate agent who was visibly distressed and he found flights that would work to get us back home earlier and to a better airport he went to the gate agent with that information and she was ecstatic that they could get a few more people on the flight while accommodating us the original flight took off and then they informed us they were unable to get us on the other flights as expected we were told that we would have a night in miami on copa so we accepted that not that we had any other choice at that point when we got to miami there was no one there to take us to a hotel as had been promised after calling we were told that all agents were gone for the day so we would have to submit a complaint to get reimbursed so here we are if you say you will do something make sure it happens
22130,vivaaerobs,1,the worst airline ever,the worst airline ever the airport employees are rude and have the worst attitude they do not try and help and above it being their fault they get an attitude towards you even if you paid for insurance and coverage they do not respect their policies
20496,thomson airways,6,i would recommend it,birmingham to bridgetown with thomson airways journey out very good comfortable seats we were in the 3rd row drinks were offered often and lunch and tea were fine cabin staff were attentive and cheerful films etc were fine and flight went smoothly and was on time journey back was not the same the cabin staff were ok but very scruffy uniform appearance there was spilt water or condensation on galley floor and no staff effort to mop it up the dinner meal was good but breakfast possibly the worst i have had with undercooked bacon and sausage i found the b787 pressurisation makes a difference and the mood lighting is good the cabin is light tall and airy overall i would recommend it but some cabin crew need extra customer care training and pride in the job
16662,regent airways,6,our seats were not good,dhaka to kolkata we were kept waiting for 15 mins due to their software problems even in the business class queue at last they checked us in under special service from another counter the flight was delayed by 25hrs due to heavy fog that day but for the business class ticket we were given a good lounge with premium food and wifi so wasnt much frustrated we were chauffeured to our aircraft in a 2006 toyota axio but we were a little disappointed as despite for paying for business class our seats were not good the galleys wall was in front of us so we were deprived of a lot of leg room but suddenly a passenger fell ill as the plane taxied to the runway for takeoff so the plane had to go back to its initial position drop off the sick passenger in an ambulance and then returned to the runway resulting in another 40 min delay at last the plane took off the food quality snacks was average was served a hot dog shwarma and cake but the seat itself was comfortable beside window there was no infotainment system at all let alone wifi so was a bit disappointed landed at kolkata after a short 30 min flight
19509,swoop,1,this company has the worst customer service,this company has the worst customer service i want to change a name on a flight simply remove a middle name so that the ticket matches the passport it has taken me 3 weeks of trying to contact customer service via their messenger platform the phone number provided simply states we cant take your call and visit xxxx online for bot assistance first attempt i provided flight info booking confirmation and the request the rude reply was unbelievable the cost of the flight after all the hidden fees turns out to be equal to or more than ac or air transat hire staff or truly make this a discount airline instead of roping customers in and then hidden fees seriously 1500 charge to speak to someone just remove the name so the ticket matches the passport btw the name was auto populated on their booking site from the previous name booked i have never written a negative review about anything in my 65 years this is unacceptable and i will never fly with this airline again
10373,germanwings,2,they have been unresponsive,we flew with germanwings or tried to on september 30th after two lengthy delays passengers were notified that the flight was cancelled and to return to the checkin counter for further information after waiting at the counter for another 30 minutes or so staff began issuing refunds or providing alternate travel options to passengers by this point it was quite late in the evening with limited options plus we were 5 hours after planned departure we managed to get a voucher with 3 other passenger to get a flight from stuttgart to zurich with an ongoing connection to amsterdam flights were with swiss we made the flight and the connector which was held back waiting for about 70 of us however luggage did not make it short of this is the airline was illprepared to manage this they offered little information or options to passengers since returning home i have been attempting to contact them via email and phone calls to discuss compensation per passenger rights brochure and they have been unresponsive not a good way to run a business
17582,sata air azores,2,lost its way in customer service,horta to london heathrow via lisbon a lack of customer care and support left us frustrated at lisbon technical issues with the horta to lisbon flight meant that we were just in time to board our scheduled connection to london our luggage was not it hadnt been deplaned from the horta flight we were given two choices board the connection now and the luggage might follow today or tomorrow and it was our responsibility to collect from london heathrow or wait for the next flight three hours later no choice then as no one wants to be separated from their luggage at heathrow i accept that flights can be delayed but the complete lack of ground support from sata for travelers with connecting flights even under code share is unforgiveable from other reviews it looks like a nice little airline has lost its way in customer service and support oh and dont get me started on the inflight catering possibly the driest sandwiches in recorded history
20948,tui airways,4,flight is worse than ryanair,this flight is worse than ryanair cheap seats paid premium for extra space seats and what a joke that was given that as they were filled for free by those that did not pay the premium as soon as we were ready to take off lucky them also premium for what seats were uncomfortable barely big enough for someone like me who is only 65kg and 52 service in flight was shabby if not woeful have a return ticket back to london with tui and will definitely not be travelling with this joke of an airline again after this people are not cattle stop treating them like farm animals and give them what they pay for
9151,eva air,8,staff is really attentive,first the app of eva air is quite good i am ana member but could use with no problem and register my ana card you can check all in app and choose your menu in advance the japanese menu from tokyo was quite good staff is really attentive food is great taipei to paris flight is older still full flat bed but food is good and staff is attentive maybe need more option between the 2 meal as it is a 15h flight for both flight wine was great i recommend this airline base on price and quality
1406,air china,6,flight departed and arrived ontime,air china canceled my flight which was the only nonstop flight between beijing and datong without any particular reason and rebooked me on the same flight the following day so i had to cut back my itinerary in datong i arrived at beijing capital airport very early in the morning much earlier than recommended by my beijing hotel concierge to find that the terminal checkin area was super crowded many customers looked very confused about selfcheckin as ones were required to print boarding passes at checkin kiosks and then to repeat the same process to print luggage tags at the bag drop area i was able to print my boarding pass but the luggage tag machine could not read my passport and no staff was found for help after roughly one hour running around i finally found a special checkin area tucked away on the other side of the terminal where i could check my luggage and rushed to make my flight inflight staff were nice but there was no ife despite all of the above i still recommend the airlines as my flight departed and arrived ontime also this was not the first time i use air china and my experience was that their pilots consistently executed very smooth takeoffs and landings
11723,ita airways,7,the food was simply awful,domestic flight was ok only slightly delayed international flight from rome to buenos aires was some 30 minutes late entertainment was working perfectly but only one recent movie was available the same of the flight i had taken more than 20 days earlier to rome staff was nice and generally willing to help however the food was simply awful i travelled with my wife who asked the lowsalt option so we had the opportunity to taste two different menus both were very poor clearly the worst we have ever tasted on a flight which is even more surprising given the quality of food in italy the country that this airlines is supposed to represent wifi did not work
1545,air dolomiti,9,air dolomiti customer review,vrn to fra return with atr 72 and embraer 195 the cabin crew was professional and kind legroom was excellent newspaper available onboard free the catering was excellent considering the flight time 100 h into the settimocielo box there were a salty snack a sweet and a small cup of water hot and cold beverages including wines offered by the cabin crew

11752,ita airways,2,a really disappointing flight,this was a really disappointing flight the plane was extremely old and not clean i am a huge clean freak but even this didnt disturb me as much as a remark made by one of the flight attendants i asked her to please retrieve my carry on which was in the overhead compartment i had my 3 year old toddler on my lap who i had been trying desperately to keep calm and sane for the duration of the flight which is why i requested assistance if youre the parent of a baby or toddler on an 8 hour flight youll understand how stressful that is anyway this flight attendant responded thats not my job how incredibly insensitive ive had travellers offer help just because they see me travelling alone with a young kid and it definitely wasnt their job it truly was the worst flight ive ever taken to the states from europe the staff overall was mediocre in their human contact and the food was not edible
17240,rwandair,7,rwandair customer review,kigalijohannesburg we were 45 mins late departing kigali with no explanation but arrived in joburg at the scheduled time clean aircraft very smooth flight professional and very friendly crew rwandan primus beer served on board with a tasty meal like most african continental airlines expensive compared to what we are used to in europe but otherwise very good recommended for convenient and safe travel throughout the region
14417,malaysia airlines,5,seats are narrow and cramped,was it two different airlines i ask myself suspect i wont be the only review on this route but travellers between akl and lhr should know that the a330200 aircraft on the aklkl section are ancient the business class is subpar and i have travelled in many seats are narrow and cramped hardly any storage space etc rubbish what concerned me more however after the near 60 minute departure delay and freeforall boarding scrum was the cabin food service signature chicken satay was what looked like a single dog chew and some greenery no peanut sauce or anything the rest of the food wasnt much better and a few courses they just didnt bother offering polar opposite is the a350 from kl to london great bc seating great service and definitely bc worthy eg 4 sticks chicken satay with salad and peanut sauce etc exemplary cabin crew i guess the problem is that they dont charge different prices for different legs of the journey 1 leg is worth it the other isnt and its selling under false pretences they dont market bc with pics of an a330200 getting on for 20yrs old now so beware next time i will go back to qatar or emirates even if it costs a bit more
5298,bamboo airways,1,no sign of the promised refund,at short notice bamboo airlines cancelled our flight and proposed an alternative schedule that got us into hanoi late at night as opposed to early afternoon as originally planned we rejected the alternative flight and were advised that we would be refunded our flights subject to sending confirmation that we did not want the alternative and card details to facilitate the refund which we duly did over a month on and six emails later we have still not had the courtesy of any communications from bamboo and no sign of the promised refund
22746,wizz air,2,do not use this airline,the flight was not comfortable at all i have to pay 180 euro on the airport because i have not check in online we were trying to do online check in a day before but it does not let me do it it say check in closed the person on the airport say you have to pay or you have to miss your flight it is all money making business i have never experience this in any other airline do not use this airline

13322,lan airlines,5,need to improve customer service,lan airlines onboard service may be great but counter service at santiago chile is simply awful the people at scl airport should be doing anything else but customer sevice online you cannot update your information it does not happen accessibility to customer service is poor if you manage to find their phone number you will be given assistance that goes nowhere even the reference number they give you on a request like updating your information on line disappears nobody knows anything reservations watch out they will change your assigned seat with no problem and when you check in you have a surprise when you show them your reservations counter people do not why you are left with whatever is available upgrades do not try it they will look at the purchase date of an economy ticket and then the price of a business on that date and give you an upgrade for the difference so even if they have empty seats on business they will not upgrade you for a reasonable fee as most airlines do they need to improve customer service
13902,lion air,3,experience was not pleasant,denpasar to jakarta i picked lion air because it was the cheapest of all budget airlines compared to air asia citilink etc the flight was delayed by 15 hour and another 30 minutes delay on flight apparently this is a regular thing to happen according to my other flight the onboard experience was not pleasant the seatbelt that i have was broken so it couldnt lock which is very dangerous the washroom is not well taken care of the toilet seat was broken and the soap container was extremely dirty the flight attendant are ok the seats are ok there werent any in flight entertainment only the security procedure pamphlet if you can find it entertaining thats good for the price difference of 20 dollar it was not worth the flight so i would rather choose other better budget airlines
7114,china united airlines,2,better not using toilets,beijing to hailaer what an airline its a low cost carrier youll get nothing aboard not even a water if you want one you need to pay cabin a bit worn and sticky better not using toilets not clean and a lack of soap cabin crews english could be improved a lot crew members dont care if passengers doing phone calls while starting or landing or passengers tsnad up whil taxi not well organised
17994,sichuan airlines,6,never being contacted,sydney to shenzhen via chongqing at an incredibly low price compared to qantas and cathay the business class checkin at sydney airport was fairly slow the skyteam lounge was basic no frequent flyer program available to accumulate miles into except their own i guess the cabin service with great crew business class seat was just an angled recline with no flat bed food was excellent but i tried the chinese menu only with special chilli sauce cannot judge on the english proficiency of the crew as i spoke mandarin chinese onboard after reading previous english speaking passengers reviews sichuan airlines cannot check the luggage through the final destination although within the same airline nor ground transport existed in chongqing airport at 4ish in the morning therefore i had to drag my bags from intl terminal to domestic for probably 500m on a 4lane airport highway against the traffic with no pedestrian path existed where the sichuan airline counters is located at the furthest end of the domestic terminal lucky there was not much traffic at 430am on another note we had to wait on board upon landing before being allowed to leave the aircraft because the custom officers had not started working encountered problems with domestic security check as my booking on their system showed internet booking instead of a chinese id card number trouble started when there was a thunderstorm in shenzhen with 200 flighted cancelled or delayed no notification from airline by phone or email they could not move me to an earlier flight on the same day that was still operating by sichuan airlines from shenzhen to chongqing only option offered was 3 days later with the same route back to sydney i therefore had to ferry to hong kong to catch a singapore airlines flight back to sydney on the same day i understand the airport chaos was beyond control of the airline due to bad weather but the weather condition in hong kong was absolutely the same as it is a just neighbouring city a few miles away sichuan airlines did offer me 50 refund for involuntary cancellation of the return journey the refund however has not come back for 2 months for now i chased them 3 times over the phone to china but was told each time theyd escalate and asked me to leave contact details never being contacted they did not have any record of my contact details or previous conversations i insisted to speak to the duty manager yesterday when i called and demanded for a follow up this apparently has worked and an email soon followed on the second day advising pig your refund has been approved check your bank account in a week to confirm i dont think i will deal with sichuan airlines again

5166,ba cityflyer,8,uneventful set of flights,edinburgh to berlin via london city with ba citiflyer it was overall an uneventful set of flights the inflight service was fine with passengers receiving a drink and their choice of popcorn crisps or biscuits the frequency of flights between edinburgh and london are great but the long layover at london city is unfortunate as there are no lounges to access
4130,alliance air,8,overall good experience,this route is operated by atr 72 though option of a320 and b737 are available with other airlines the ticket for this atr is always cheaper than other so went with this and was a good decision i was traveling with only cabin baggage so no interaction with check in boarding and departed on time check in baggage allowance 15 kg and cabin baggage 5kg seats were comfortable they dont offer any mealrefreshments service neither complimentary nor paid only water is providedavailable reached delhi 20 min before time overall good experience

1084,air berlin,4,will wait before i fly them again,zurich to bucharest via berlin txl with air berlin punctual flights on each leg aisle seats in the front of the airplane as i am oneworld emerald ft booked the flight a while ago and ordered lunch this option is not available anymore meals also not onboard had to claim the money back which was easy to do and fast with no complication so far all ok but i really do not understand their changes of service in the context that they want to restructure as a smaller network carrier why reduce food and drinks to zero then the new biz class product 4 seats in the front row not even any special menu but the option that you get what ever you want from the onboard food shop there is a difference of several hundred euros to a classic fare ticket so if you have no intercontinental connection its not worth the money the other thing to observe is to have plenty of spare money with you if you want to buy food cc reader was once not working and they could not change a 50 euros bill i like this airline and im ok to pay for food if i am hungry but its definitely their problem to have enough change i will wait a little until they have made the changes before i will fly them again
20301,thai smile airways,6,flights with thai smile were not satisfactory,the flights with thai smile were not satisfactory being a thai airways company i expected the same kind of service which i didnt see the food on the first flight was okay on the second we were handed a take away bag with a sweet leaving the airplane that did not really make any sense to me would have been nice to get something to drink during the flight no screens on board and the announcements were barely audible also both flights were delayed which was quite annoying
22281,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,anrlcyanr friendly checkin staff and friendly flight attendants on both flights good sandwich free drink including a small belgian chocolate before the landing is a nice touch for such a short flight good seat pitch
22954,xiamen airlines,5,crew looked tired,flight left about 30 minutes late which is much less of a delay than usual crew looked tired as this was an evening flight crew english announcements still not really understandable through pa no comment from cockpit crew as is usual with international airlines extremely hard landing in hkg no noticeable weather or turbulence no comment from the cockpit crew again they still have a long way to go in my opinion to be on par with international airlines sometimes hearing the crews voice in understandable english since this is an international sector would help
19233,sun country airlines,1,worst baggage experience,worst baggage experience i have ever had my bag not only took an hour to come out it was soaking wet all the way through it was a 4 hour drive after this to find everything stained with whatever was near my bag my uggs ruined and not dry socks or underwear so i file a complaint to be told it wasnt said at the airport or 4 hours after the flight so it is invalid if thats how a company like this needs to make 40 so be it will not be flying with them ever again paying extra to have my bags ruined and an hour added on to my 15 hour travel day i dont think so never again
97,aegean airlines,4,poor customer service,party of 4 2 couples traveling together last minute 1 hour before our seats changed i upgraded everyone to row 11 now one is in 11 3 are in 26th row we were told the plane changed and we cant honor your seat selection poor customer service we were not the only party where the seats changed when i called customer service he stated well this happens occasionally
7585,corendon airlines,3,noisy and old b737400,alghero to amsterdam flight departed 15 hours late safety procedures were rushed check in had been a chaos because the seatplan of the plane didnt match with the online seat reservation system for a different type of aircraft during check in corendon personel said a different type of aircraft that was going to be used not telling when asked by me that this was going to be a noisy and nearly 30 years old b737400 without sufficient leg space the outward flight was relatively apart from the toilet where people over 160 couldnt stand up straight and a lack of leg space and thats why i rate 310
5108,azerbaijan airlines,8,the seats are not lieflat,azerbaijan airlines from baku to london i was a little confused at baku airport as i couldnt find any business class check in but the regular desks were quiet so no big deal no priority baggage tag the azal lounge in baku is comfortable with self service bar and a few snacks but no hot food the aircraft is quite new and business class was arranged 232 there were only about 8 passengers in the cabin on my flight the crew were very attentive and friendly i usually enjoy azal food but this flights food was dry and not very tasty though you do get a lot good bar service with lots of choice the ife on azal is pretty poor i found there was lots of leg room but the seats are not lieflat and by the time i got to london id had enough flight arrived on time and the luggage was off the aircraft fairly quickly all in all a good flight though not exceptional and much cheaper than bas business class tickets on this route
6141,brussels airlines,8,didnt face any big troubles,i had heard horror stories about this company i had four flights with them and didnt face any big troubles went to prague from faro with a stop in brussels first flight was delayed for a bit more than one hour it happens who knows whose fault it was second flight was on time pretty normal the whole operation and staff good luggage allowance for the rate
7164,citilink,9,flight attendant nice and friendly,i flew citilink 2 days ago from jakarta cgk to surabaya to attend the wedding party at 10am i chose qg 801 suppose to land at 915am the only problem i have was my name was not appear on the quick check in computer terminal but one of the ground staff quickly asked my id and checked me in in the normal terminal going into the aircraft i was greeted by a flight attendant who was nice and friendly
22575,vueling airlines,9,on time departure early arrival,smooth check in at brussels airport and despite departing on a very busy day the whole airport experience was smooth on time boarding and greeted by the friendly cabin crew while on board emergency exit seat was assigned and was very appreciated ample legroom making sure the flight was very comfortable drinkssnacks for purchase as well as wifi bundle to choose from and worked pretty good on time departure early arrival overall excellent
10442,germanwings,4,germanwings customer review,travelled from manchester to vienna with a 3 hour stop over in kolnbonn first flight was good with an on time departure reasonably friendly cabin crew staff and a decent and comfortable journey however from our stop in kolnbonn the trip deteriorated we were segregated into a small area of the airport with very little to do see or even eatshop the second flight was 45 minutes late and had some of the most miserable cabin staff i have ever experienced i wasnt even offer a drink to purchase i would rate germanwings as very average and certainly not what i would expect from a german carrier
17689,scat airlines,8,a decent service,ustkamenogorsk to karaganda i recently took a group tour in kazakhstan and this flight was part of the itinerary the checkin counters at ustkamenogorsk airport were kinda sovietstyle but the process was efficient and we were soon in the rather featureless departure lounge bring coins there is a coffee vending machine for entertainment aircraft wasnt new but was well presented it was completely full apparently this flight doesnt run very often but one flight attendant managed to serve a soft drink to everyone during the short flight we had an airline pilot in our group he had been wondering what to expect but in the end thought the flight was fine luggage came quickly and nobody had any loss or damage overall a decent service
17223,rwandair,2,my luggage are yet to arrive,kigali to lagos with rwandair i landed in lagos on the 22nd july and till today 26th july my luggage are yet to arrive this type of service is certainly unacceptable the airline is not the first that i would be traveling on have my daughters things in there and a couple of other important items i have never experienced this type of service with any airline after calling them several times all they could tell me after 4 days is that my baggage was tagged for kigali without any remorse how insensitive
15552,onur air,4,otherwise i would avoid,very small seats and drinks were not free boarding was very disorganized and we sat well past the boarding time with no explanation the price was decent but would take turkish airlines instead if the price was anywhere near onur air verdict if onur air price is much better than turkish airlines and the flight is short it might be worth it but otherwise i would avoid
10702,gulf air,2,173 eur for 5 kgs extra,hyderabad to paris via bahrain i mean where do i even begin first of all there was the issue of excess baggage because gulf air adds on laptop bag and laptop as cabin luggage they left me no choice but to pay 173 eur for 5 kgs extra the flight was delayed by 15 hours and it was so cold in the plane and they didnt even provide us blankets many passengers complained but to no avail no headsets were provided for inhouse entertainment barely made it my connecting flight to paris even though the service from bah to cdg was not bad they lost my bag
22450,volotea,8,great experience,great experience with this low cost airline the staff is very helpful and they do not annoy selling whatever they can
7276,coastal aviation,5,disappointed with this airline,i booked a chartered flight more then one month prior my flight two days before my flight i messaged coastal in order to make a small adjustment to my departure time however come the day of our flight and coastal had completely forgotten about us i had to call coastal upon arriving at the airport when i concluded the plane was not there our flight time from zanzibar to dar es salaam is only 30 minutes and the plane arrived one hour late being stranded at the airfield with an 8 month old baby in the midafternoon is unacceptable i asked three times to have the contact details of the general manager but was refused to have the information i was greatly disappointed with this airline and will not be flying with them again
21996,vistara,6,soft product was found to be wanting,i cannot fault the hard product modern clean and well maintained aircraft but the soft product was found to be wanting the crew seemed to go about their job in a robotic nature no smile no pleasantries and the service was very disjointed the food was a big let down and expected much better it was bland poor quality and mine was inedible
660,aigle azur,1,do not recommend at all,kiev to paris so i bought tickets 15 months before the trip unfortunately plans had changed i had to cancel my trip i also purchased insurance for cancellation with tickets so a week before the flight i wanted to cancel my tickets i tried to call for 3 days in a row to their support line and every time i was listening to music for 1015 minutes and getting billed for that calling from abroad is quite expensive but no one ever picked up the phone during their official business hours i sent multiple emails about my request no reply i tried to submit multiple requests via manage my booking on their website but every time i tried to submit i got the ticket number with status closed right away and no ability to check it so in the end i just lost my money and their insurance is worthless as nobody will ever get back to you do not recommend at all first time seeing such big company who does not care about their customers at all and their website has a lot of bugs as well find another company to flight with
6476,caribbean airlines,5,caribbean airlines customer review,18th june 2013 bw902 poslgw 1st july 2013 bw903 lgwpos check in at pos was fast flight was scheduled to depart 740pm but boarding began at 730pm departed 45 minutes late once airborne food was nice and multiple drink runs personal screens for inflight entertainment were not working nice 767 with comfy seats however the return was a nightmare scheduled to depart london at 1250pm on 30th june bw 903 got to the airport on the 30th june at 10am to be told by another passenger that the flight was cancelled a long line with frustrated passengers for 2 hours as no information from caribbean airlines after 3 hours i was told that it was due to the ac not working and they will be putting us up in a hotel overnight and was booked for a 450am departure the next day 1st july at the hotel told that the flight was delayed until 950am and to head back to the check in counter at 7am finally got to the gate and we boarded on time did not leave on time left 3 hours later flight attendants were less than helpful and sour flight was wonderful with fair ife and a hot meal and 3 drink runs afternoon tea as well arrived after 5pm on 1st july
11010,hong kong airlines,3,they changed my seat,okinawa to hong kong very bad service i reserved aisle seat but they changed my seat without notifying me after just boarding the flight they have not turned on the ac and the cabin is really hot
13828,libyan airlines,3,libyan airlines customer review,manchester to tripoli the ticket said departure was 1145am at checkin time there was no checkin open and it transpired that the plane was scheduled to leave at 4pm so checkin wouldnt be open for another 3 hours in the end the plane left at 525pm so preflying was an absolute nightmare however once on board things were much better nice food and drink no alcohol unfortunately and the cabin crew attentive and friendly but unfortunately it took ages for the bags to appear once we arrived in tripoli so to sum up libyan arab airlines seem to be good in the air not so good on the ground
5416,bassaka air,1,my last trip with this airline,phnom penh to siem reap once a good airline now absolutely unreliable flying from phnom penh to siem reap takes 3035 minutes but today our flight was delayed for more than one hour citing mechanical problems this is rather unsettling especially since the last time i flew they had the same problem but with a shorter delay the staff hid in the back room so they didnt have to face customers and the bassaka terms offer no guarantee of compensation for long delays this is my last trip with this airline
16727,regional express,3,regional express customer review,when the flights work its a good service but 8 trips and 1 that is on time is not uncommon experience to orange residents constantly late constantly diverting to bathurst constantly caught by surprise with busses and planes not working take my tip hire a car or catch the trainbus its quicker 6 out of 8 times i would have got there before the plane and much cheaper
5906,boutique air,2,whole fiasco cost me much more,flew from altoona to bwi to catch a flight to lax very quick and convenient imagine my surprise when 3 days before our return trip i was notified that our flight was moved ahead 2 hours making it impossible to make the connecting flight back from lax the glib suggestion of rescheduling for the next day was impossible due to work commitments the request that they wait 12 hour so that we could get on the flight was also quickly dismissed even though on an 8 seat plane we would have been 25 of the passengers the cost to reschedule our cross country flight would have been over 1000 luckily we were able to get a credit from southwest and schedule a flight into state college instead after spending about 3 hours on hold with various entities we were told that we would be refunded what amounted to 25 of the cost of the flight which i still havent seen this whole fiasco cost me much more a whole morning of a weekend visit to my son who lives across the country to try to figure it out
2852,air seychelles,5,air seychelles customer review,service was excellent staff friendly meals were good boeing 767200 was very very old my son went to put his seatbelt on and it came off in his hand the seat adjacent to that one had a table that wouldnt stay up they do need new equipment but flight was otherwise uneventful
8357,edelweiss air,2,food is absolutely awful and totally substandard for business class,apart from the lie flat bed this is basically premium economy the food is absolutely awful and totally substandard for business class this is one of the main reasons i say it is more premium economy the tray is not at all business class small and cramped the plates not at all up to standard my main was a sausage can you believe this the accompaniment of hash browns were soggy because chef in his wisdom had them up against cabbagewhich of course is wet so a main of a sausage wet hash browns and cabbage i didnt eat this mess disgraceful my wifes salmon was swimming in oil and inedible the dessert might have been acceptable but it was tinyhardly a full spoonful the drinks selection is basic a two type wine selection for red and whiteno quality spiritsno dessert wine no cheese board for after the ife is dated with a very small selection the only thing that was good were the cabin crew excellent and i could see they were embarrassed regarding the food no this was beyond disappointing we were totally surprised at their business class we would not fly this airline again
455,aerolineas argentinas,6,flights went well and punctual,booked in september for a december 47 buenos aires to ushuaia return thru flightnetwork discovered two weeks later that my flight from usheze was cancelled and cancelled by the airline contacted aerolineas argentina via their facebook admin with no help but they told me to contact flightnetwork directly to fix our tickets after several calls to flightnetwork and emails our tickets finally got fixed to fly 7th december ush to aep original flight with the same airline was usheze 7th dec also happened to be the airlines birthday flights went well and were punctual plane interiors on my flights were very well maintained there was the wifi logo at the entrance exterior of both planes but there was no such service for a flight over 3 hours long they only served normal beverages and cookies on their birthday they served an extra but very thin ham and cheese sandwich even the bread was sliced thinly checkin was functional 15kg checkin luggage for domestic flights pay an additional 150 argentinian pesos if you luggage exceeds 17kg and up to 23kg if you exceed 23kg to 30kg you pay 400 pesos oneway
11187,iberia,6,not credit any more miles with partner airlines,i have just realised that iberia will not credit any more miles with partner airlines or at least not with the aadvantage program of american airlines in the last 3 or 4 flights that i have done with iberia the only way i got my miles credited was by requesting the missing miles through aadvantage because iberia never credits them by itself in contrast with qatar or british airways which credit them in a matter of days finally after requesting missing miles once again aadvantage sent me a mail denying my request on grounds of airline unable to validate this is despite that i sent the boarding pass issued by iberia and that my aadvantage number is printed on the boarding pass itself it really is disappointing i believe this is becoming a generalized policy given the rough times that airlines have gone through since the pandemic
3354,airasia philippines,4,couldnt get in the flight,worst experience with an airline very disappointing i bought a flight ticket to hanoi with a transfer in kaohsiung taiwan the taiwan government site says i do not need a transfer visa as long i dont leave the airport however airasia doesnt have the facility that allows me to remain in the airport without a visa so i couldnt get in the flight and they didnt refund me they should have given the information when the purchase made
18299,singapore airlines,1,lived up to high expectations,my first flight postpandemic and singapore airlines lived up to high expectations the cabin crew were excellent and made regular drinks runs throughout the flight with trays of water juice and sometimes beer i was impressed by their professionalism politeness and friendliness throughout the journey despite having to serve almost a full flight flood including snacks in between meals at the galley was plentiful even for economy class two free hours of wifi for economy class passengers was a welcome addition to the service everything went smoothly from boarding to disembarking prior to the flight i had called the call centre to make a booking amendment and the service from the call centre was also efficient
7593,corendon airlines,2,corendon airlines customer review,flight was good but cabin crew were impolite to passengers my mother asked several times for a pillow but they did not consider and replied my mom very impolitely in a bad tone one of the crew pour a glass of orange juice on my clothing while serving the dinner and just gave me some napkins
16891,royal air maroc,5,they really need to update their interiors,the plane 737800 was dirty and in bad condition on the inside with bits of plastic insulation missing there was a strong smell of toilet chemical and the seat tray and back of the seat in front was sticky no ptv the seats themselves were worn out and wonky casablanca airport was a hot disorganised mess with confusing signs long queues nowhere to sit and buses that didnt seem to know where they were going food options there were overpriced and very poor quality the domestic leg of my return flight was cancelled adding an overnight stop in casablanca they ignored my emails and i had to call at 5am and hold for 30m to finally get through the rest of the time they just hung up the phone and sent messages saying that they were busy they agreed to change my ticket to a sameday connection on turkish airlines which was 100 times better the only thing i liked about ram was the food which was actually very tasty delicious chicken or fish they really need to update their interiors employ more call centre staff and fix the horrible mess at casablanca make it a place that is pleasant to transit rather than a hassle also it would be nice if they would stop cancelling flights
17690,scat airlines,4,not sure it is worth it,almaty to oskemen i flew this airline before and it was ok but this time my bad experience started with the checkin where i was offered to either pay 5000 tenge to the checkin attendant or 7000 to the cashier it could lead to a situation when i could be missing a bag but on paper everything would be just fine i was also told that supposedly my hand luggage wouldnt fit so i would have to check it in while according to their website my bag is exactly what it should be i had my laptop in it and there was no way i was going to check it in i called their almaty office to complain but they hung up on me in the middle of conversation the aircraft that they gave us was sitting in the cold overnight and the ice that accumulated inside started thawing as it got warmer and a number of passengers had water dripping all over them the flight attendants acted as if it were a normal occurrence they are cheap but i am not sure it is worth it
18252,singapore airlines,4,late by up to 90 mins,flight i had with singapore airlines are late by up to 90 mins on arrival its inferior to qatar airways business class underwhelming lounges okay onboard catering no diningondemand quirky flatbed seats on the a350ulr and more so on the new a380 meager amenities onboard the cabin crew is somewhat the only part of singapore airlines nearly on par with qatar airways
15698,openskies,7,openskies customer review,oryewr first time using open skies i didnt know about the airlines until i was told by my travel agent that it offers value for money was told that it was all business class but when i boarded it was obvious that my seat and the amenity kit given were inferior from those at the front of the aircraft the food and service were ok and although the airline is operated by ba i think bas business class service is better and the fas are more attentive but of course i suppose you have to pay premium for that
14280,lynx air,3,cheap flight is not worth it,horrible service my flight was said to be delayed 3 times but it took off at a completely different time then all my emails the time on the board at the airport and the website it was all different the flight it self was meh do not recommend the cheap flight is not worth it
760,air arabia,2,worst airline i have ever used,worst airline i have ever used they treat us like we are flying for free staff here is very rude to customers and things are not even organised a bit around here this was totally disappointing and i will never travel air arabia again
7704,croatia airlines,7,croatia airlines customer review,flew zagreb frankfurt return check in was fast and smooth outbound flight on a320 very clean aircraft staff were great very friendly and attentive to all passengers there was no inflight entertainment at all just a few screens with commercials generally good service for 15 hour flight
9366,fiji airways,5,more like a budget airline,on the outward leg to fiji we had selected our seats over 4 months prior and the selected seats were confirmed during online checkin and again when we did the bag drop on date of travel when we reached the boarding gate we were advised that due to safety reasons and load balancing we had been reallocated seats from row 16 to row 36 it transpires that someone else was allocated our original seats making a joke of the reason given the website suggests that inflight entertainment offers a range of movies and other media but in reality economy passengers get to watch a movie on overhead screens serving two rows of seats so 70s style entertainment if you want a wine with your meal you have to pay for it as your choices are juice coffee or water for a front line airline they act more like a budget airline
15797,pegasus airlines,6,a very bad experience,it was a very bad experience our flight was very delayed from muscat to istanbul and we cant get our next flight pegasus staff dont care at all we keep running to each pegasus staff asking help what to do was very bad day we have other programs in saint petersburg and we was late 24 hours everything was mixed in the end pegasus staff told me to buy visa and to go to other pegasus office and they promised me the visa payment pegasus will refund it to me was no other choice to stay 24 hours in airport or to pay the visa finally we paid the visa to go to other office as pegasus staff told us but after i paid my visa the pegasus sent me email they will not refund it to me what kind of services this how come we need to wait 24hours in the airport where is customer care they should pay me the money i spend because of them they delay the flight i will never travel with them from now if they will not refund my right
15294,norwegian,3,customer service couldnt help,nice to oslo very poor customer support the website couldnt proceed for several days the payment with my foreign credit cards with 3d authorization no proper explanation were given customer service line couldnt help in the end had to book through another online service and the airline declined to apply my rewards wired service and absolutely unhelpful
20787,transaero airlines,6,transaero airlines customer review,flights from st petersburg to moscow are now from the pulkovo new terminal comfort lounge business lounge not available is awful its worse than regular space no food no beverages only water and coca cola dirty chairs only instant coffee
7327,comair,2,comair customer review,this airline flies under the banner of british airways i thought the planes looked old and tired the customer service onboard was ok although slighly abrupt the flight was delayed by 30 minutes my flight with the same airline to durban a few days earlier was also delayed for about an hour when i asked for a customer service feedback form they seemed shocked that i should want to offer feedback needless to say there was no way to leave feedback with the airline i wont be flying with them again luckily there is now quite a bit of choice in south africa
13366,lan airlines,8,lan airlines customer review,santiagopunta arenasmount pleasant falklands on time and managed to get comfortable exit row seat typical lan efficiency but the food service is inadequate for what is in total a 6 hour journey on a domestic a320 just a choice of nibbles on the 35 hrs down to punta arenas and the same on the 15 hours to mpa quite interesting landing at mpa which is a uk military base
3741,airnorth,9,airnorth customer review,tsvdrwtsv flight out on time the aircraft was clean and comfortable certainly more personal space on the embraer 170 then you get on other economy flights in australia the cabin wasnt full so after take off it was a matter of grabbing a pair of seats to myself a light morning meal of sandwiches water coffeetea and a small chocolate was complimentary the return flight was delayed 7 hours and advice was received about this the afternoon before by email and sms two hot meal options offered on that flight one vegetarian the other sausages and mash beer wine and spirits were complimentary on this leg perhaps owing to the long delay i didnt ask i just enjoyed having two seats to myself again and kicked back with a fee jim beam and colas flight attendants professional and attentive
6139,brussels airlines,2,second one gets cancelled automatically,flight comfort is okay in economy class no issue there from now on i will avoid them as much as i can due to the following experience i booked a return flight berbruber but due to my own mistake the first flight was booked for the evening instead of the morning as there are no alternatives with bu i booked a single flight to brussels with another company and didnt check in for the brussels airlines ticket if you dont checkin into the first flight the second one gets cancelled automatically if you dont confirm with their services within a day or so and the heads up is done with a simple email on a saturday morning in my case i ended not being able to checkin with the flight back to berlin calls the support and just get brushed off that i should have read the fine prints
7156,citilink,8,service great for budget airline,jakarta to surabaya i arrived 0430am at jakarta terminal 1 for my 0555am to surabaya i went straight to check in area to finish the formalities which the line was quite ok at that time i went straight to the gate and for some reason on the departure monitor my flight will depart at 0610am at 0515 boarding commenced and i use bus to the aircraft which park all the way to the remote area in terminal 2 boarded the aircraft at 0530 which and i sat at 1d flight attendant were very cheerful and smile a lot on board service was great for budget airline landed at sub 30 mins behind schedule but i was quite happy since the fa apologise for the delay to each one of the passenger during disembarking
21804,virgin america,4,was cramped and uncomfortable,i have enjoyed previous virgin america flights and was looking forward to flying them from seattle to los angeles the plane was cramped and uncomfortable and my seat didnt recline no snacks on a 3 hour flight and 1 tiny cup of lukewarm coffee then a 20 min wait on the runway as our arrival gate was not available
1703,air france,3,the crew was very friendly,disappointing flight a very old boeing 777 seat configuration 232 in business champagne and wine were nothing special food was the worst i had on a flight my beef was overdone vegetables tasteless and cheese had supermarket quality we arrived punctually and the crew was very friendly
15657,openskies,8,openskies customer review,jfkory on b757200 we flew in prem plus which is a definite premium economy upgrade rather than business downgrade but a sizeable step up from the economy seats which looked very tight indeed we secured 6d and 6f which were the bulkhead seats wider than bas new wtp seats and had features like lumbar support a decent headrest and footrest and good recline very comfortable although my headrest broke two hours in so i had to fashion one from the pillow i would recommend exit row seats in row 7 as these have excellent leg room and a bolster cushion for your foot which looked very comfortable though these seem very difficult to book in advance without silver or gold status row 6 was good as no one was reclining into your space but if youre over 6 foot 2 the bulkhead could actually be a hindrance the promised glass of bubbles on boarding never materialised or at any point during the flight and i was disappointed with the meals which were rather plain chicken curry or pasta with vegetables hardly inspiring and a bag with an apple muffin and orange juice for breakfast the flight attendants however were pleasant and attentive throughout and a credit to the airline the plane really is showing its age and it was extremely noticeable in the general wear and tear faded windows and the presence of ashtrays at the back of the plane there was quite a bit of turbulence coming back in the jet stream and you really felt every little bump on this aging machine i would say its time for a fleet update i didnt use the inflight entertainment personal ipad much but was disappointed to see it only had 25 charge so i doubt it would have worked for the flight duration anyway that said it did have the same decent selection of films as the ba flight we flew out on plus some additional french films which was a nice touch arrival in orly was quick and easy and we spent time in the iberia codeshare lounge before connecting to lhr the lounge was quiet and had a reasonable selection of drinks but thats where the benefits end the lounge is quite a trek as others have noted and the food selection consisted of some plain crisps and plain crackers during the nearly 3 hours we were there and nothing else was offered there are no toilets in the lounge one has to go out although they are close by and the promised escort to the plane didnt materialise despite the fact that i was on crutches i requested wheelchair support and they were unable to provide this if you have elite status i would certainly recommend using an alternative lounge all in all openskies does have its benefits with fewer passengers and a nice wide comfortable leather seat in prem plus that said experiencing it once was enough for me personally and ill be sticking with bas new wtp product in future and flying uk usa direct
11381,icelandair,4,i will never fly icelandair again,on our return flight from london we laid over in at keflavik airport we learned when we arrived that we could not return to our departure airport newark instead we were diverted to new york and had to find our own way back to our car before our 3 hour drive home the airline has agreed to reimburse our uber fee since they created a disturbance in our travel plans however while on the flight to new york seated in row 2 of first class a couple in front of us had a small and very old dog about an hour before landing the woman was telling the man to hurry and get up because the dog had to pee she then carried to dog to the service area and told the flight attendant the problem the attendant gave the woman an extra blanket the woman returned to the seat put the blanket on the seatput the dog on the seat until it relieved itself then she returned to blanket to the flight attendant the blanket was not waterproof or absorbent enough to keep the urine from running down the seat to the floor where of course my personal bag was stored when i retrieved it my purse was covered with dog urine and half the contents were also wet i advised the attendant on my way out and she simply said oh thats not good thats it the smell was awful and i had to carry that bag without any offer to help clean it or bag itnothing i will never fly icelandair again given this wholly unacceptable animal policy i have no problem with small animals traveling in the cabin as long as there are proper and sanitary provisions for their normal bodily functions the flights were otherwise clean and comfortable and staff was attentive wifi stinks

14411,malaysia airlines,3,the worst business class experience,this would have to be the worst business class offering i have flown in over 20years the seats we were allocated in row 2 were barely even a decent premium economy they were tight uncomfortable and cramped my wife who had the window seat said it felt like she was trapped in a box the amount of space allocated for these two seats is appalling there was no storage whatsoever not even to rest a drink bottle the only good thing was the staff were friendly and the satay sticks were nice the rest of the food was poor i have travelled a lot as all my family live overseas and i have to say this was the worst business class experience i have had never again

11865,japan airlines,9,cabin crew were friendly,akita to sapporo this flight was operated by jair a fast and friendly checkin was followed by an effortless punctual and enjoyable flight the cabin crew were friendly although there was no onboard service on this flight possibly due to turbulence baggage arrived quickly all thoughtfully placed on the carousel with the handles facing out i was on a train into town within 25 minutes of touchdown
6165,brussels airlines,4,4h 20 mins flight without a meal,the boarding was very easy the crew was lovely but that was the only good thing about this flight it was a 4h 20 mins flight without a meal the legroom was not good and yerevan is the only destination above the 2h without the option to buy a hot meal

21675,vietnam airlines,7,provided reliable service,experience onboard vietnam was your run of the mill standard economy everything felt fine seat was standard no fuss from staff and flight attendants provided their routine service in an efficient manner albeit the full flight i ordered the special lowfat meal and to my surprise it was quite appetizing i also appreciated the amenity kit as the case proved useful and durable throughout my travels unlike other ones ive gotten my minor gripes had to do with the limited selection of movies and tv programs to choose from minor delay in bangkok with no proper communication and the absence of a foot rest my big gripe has to do with how antiquated the website and online services are inputting details like fqtv and requesting special meals wasnt userfriendly overall vietnam airlines provided reliable service leaving me with no major hang ups and getting me to my destination soundly
10758,gulf air,6,they dont even smile,i flew economy class on b7879 from manila to bahrain the food was delicious though they dont offer you a menu as the variety of meals is low there is a chance if you dont fly in the b7879 then you dont get ife content at all and if ife is available it has outdated content and they do not update it quite frequently there is a lack of focus on content and simple things they should do like updating their ife frequently adding more variety of options in food meals and snacks and making their staff more hospitable as they dont even smile or greet welcome you upon entering of exiting the aircraft the b7879 is new as the seats the legroom is plenty as i am a tall male and i could fit my legs comfortably although the support for your back isnt great even with a pillow youll feel like there is a lack of padding to support your lower back or maybe i am just very tall
11673,israir airlines,4,israir airlines customer review,one way ticket from tel aviv to rome the aircraft is half empty israir really dont know how to sell those tickets i asked for vegetarian food and got a weird sandwich no expectations there overall it is a good airline service is good
20232,thai smile airways,5,i was made to check my bag,kudos to the flight attendants who served a meal during this 40 minute flight my seat in smile plus was comfortable but check in was not okay first of all there was a family with some issue ahead of me i was kept waiting for 15 minutes while smile economy passengers and online check in customers were promptly helped by several agents you do not leave your premium passengers waiting longer than economy passengers then i was made to check my bag because it was over 7 kg but many other passengers brought huge heavy bags onboard without anyone stopping them i know because i boarded early and watched everyone else on the flight board why were so many people allowed to bend the rules
2698,air pegasus,6,pretty good for a budget airline,overall the airline offered a clean cabin efficient crew almost friendly good seat spacing and ontime service pretty good for a budget airline
21961,vistara,2,worst experience i have ever had,vistara has given a worst experience of travel during my journey from ahmedabad to mumbai on 19 the march 2023 after their confirmation regarding the extra baggage added in the pnr they didnt allow me to board without charge of extra luggage it was a hot discussion at the ahmedabad airport and they treated me with totally rude behaviour and wasted 3 hours at the airport they dont know the meaning of humbleness and the fact came out that there is not synchronization between their team customer team response totally disagreed by their airport team since last 35 days im sending chasers to them but received 2 emails that to with incomplete information and denied to give the refund worst experience i have ever had in my life for this flight highly not recommended im ready to share the further proof if there is a need
18237,singapore airlines,7,provided the very best,from start to finish the service food and cabin crew provided the very best there are only 4 first class seats on the 777 and as expected more than enough space to stow belongings and move around the cabin the cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive only two negatives the toilets are tiny and one almost needs to be a contortionist to get changed into pyjamas and the seats although very wide do not have much padding or recline so are uncomfortable for sitting in for long periods of time in the lie flat mode a good mattress was provided which made the bed comfortable food was exceptional and beautifully presented only hope that the hot towel service makes a comeback
6266,bulgaria air,6,there is no reason to choose this airline,flew bulgaria air from tel aviv to varna and return 4 hours delay every hour they updated with another delay old aircraft and bad service once we arrived to the aircraft we spent another 30 minutes without air conditioning unless the price is very low comparing the rest there is no reason to choose this airline

20455,thomson airways,7,an acceptable experience,arrived at gatwick to face a tediously slow 45 minute queue to checkin before proceeding through the well renovated security clearance in north terminal swift boarding although flight was delayed an hour whilst sat onboard due to an atc issue which required a rerouting frequent updates provided by a friendly captain once underway food and drinks service prompt and although not generous tasted good ptvs are good but the fimtv selection is very poor c ten films seat pitch good 33 and decent recline although seats are narrow and can be uncomfortable when youve a large person seated beside you as i did on the return flight smooth boarding by bus timely departure and landed 45 minutes early meal service and dutyfree took four hours to be completed which left less than five hours to sleep before being awoken for a reasonably good english breakfast all in all an acceptable experience you get what you pay for value for money and we only opted for thomson due to the direct flights to puerto vallarta to visit friends preferable to a twostop option via madmex
5382,bangkok airways,3,has become uncaring of its passengers,have to fly bangkok airways regularly due to business commitments on this route due to the times and they also give premier members premium lane passes at bangkok to speed up the often 23 hour wait but without any notice or email to members they just withdrew the premium lane passes and by not telling us we got stuck in the sad long slow lines of thailand immigration overall they use very old planes we once had a plane abort take off at phnom penh mostly no business class and generally the airline has become uncaring of its passengers recently
8067,dragonair,7,it was enjoyable flight,hong kong to beijing with cathay dragon my seat was at the middle of the aircraft one meal was served and the total flight time was about 3 hours the meal service was good the crew were friendly and nice nevertheless the inflight entertainment system was not quite updated and the legroom of the economy class seat was not quite enough the area of the restrooms could also be improved in total it was enjoyable flight
18579,smartwings,2,service and attitude appalling,im quite a frequent flyer and my flight with smartwings from gatwick to prague was one of the worst one ive ever experienced the overall service and attitude was just appalling they fly old and dirty aircraft with very limited leg room but what is even worse is their customer service on my last flight from london me and other two people were late for our baggage checkin by approx 15 minutes due to industrial action on uk railways the smartwings representative were notified by the front desk however they wouldnt make any effort to check in our bags even though the boarding hadnt finished and we would still make it in time for our departure we all had to pay for new flight tickets for the following morning
19772,tame,4,tame customer review,living in ecuador now after 2 years in costa rica that is important because i can use my distancia miles collected with taca on tame and never before using ffmiles was so easy and well handled flying tame various times between guayaquil and quito the planes are mostly new and modern e190 and a320 used on this route occasionly their remaining 727 but those are in very good condition it is a 30 minute hop and you receive a beverage as well a little cake muffin or similar which i find quiet impressive flights had been always on time service on the ground and air leaves nothing to complain announcements in onboard in english and spanish ground staff speaking both as well changing flights to earlier or later is professionally and quickly handled without extra costs and a smile i would recommend tame travelling in ecuador
1524,air dolomiti,7,air dolomiti customer review,i was flying from trnmuc last august the overall flight experience was good i booked the flight through lufthansa where air dolomiti is their carrier operating from turin the cabin crew were polite and helpful the flight was on time but the ground crew delayed it a few minutes with moving passengers from the aircraft to the terminal i flew thrice in the same month on the same route where my overall satisfaction was good

1243,air canada,3,last time i will fly with air canada,flight late leaving yvr to vienna via toronto because we were told by captain it took too long to load bags although we had a layover of about 90 minutes we were so late leaving that air canada canceled the flight from toronto to vienna and put us on a flight via frankfurt 4 hours later this was despite the fact that when we landed our our original flight was still at the departure gate we were told that there was not time to transfer our checked luggage now for comparison pretty much the exact same thing happened coming home excpt it was lufthansa they had a shuttle pick us up immediately on arrival at munich which we were flying via and take us to departing flight they hustled a word that seems not to be in air canadas vocabulary and got the bags transferred we were of course late leaving but this was made up on the long flight something ac seems not to have considered as a national airline it is a true embarrassment i wish this was the first time but it is not the last time i will fly with air canada

20550,tigerair,8,perfect for a low cost airline,sydney to melbourne and was impressed great cheap ticket as i was using auto check in kiosk at the airport a professional tigerair check in staffer approached to assist me even though i did not need help and she put me in an exit row with extra legroom and directed me to check in counter for bag drop and instantly issued a new boarding pass well groomed warm professional supervisor pulled me out of line as he was free and line was busy with a family and he took me to another counter to quickly check my bags and complete check in everyone called me by name very friendly on flight cabin crew were all well groomed great uniforms men in vests and long sleeve women with scarves and wedding worthy hairdos great for a low cost carrier friendly smiles and very professional looking us in the eye and calling us by name flight on time boarding was completed early actually liked the cloth seats most seats are leather on low cost carriers liked a320 over 737 it feels more spacious liked how they use front and back stairs for boardingdeplaning as it is much faster than the long slow que on other airlines which only use one door simple menu but perfect for a low cost airline you can pre order bigger meals too low cost terminal at melbourne is brand new simple and slick very efficient what more can you want for the price airline has massively improved since problems a few years ago
5824,bmi regional,8,without any issues,east midlands to brussels flight to and from brussels without any issues check in relatively quick and no queues at airport on way there onboard seating was fine with a 12 cabin layout free refreshments and a small snack essentially ok for a short flight aircraft themselves are on the older side showing some wear and tear but being able to fly from local airport is a huge bonus only downside is being if you need to drop a bag off this only opens 90 minutes before departure and in brussels on the return the queue through security was massive longest i have queued in years this meant once through was almost straight to the gate for boarding
12205,jetblue airways,3,jetblue is turning into spirit airlines,i see jetblue is turning into spirit airlines i purchased a ticket thats cost met 187 that turned into travel credits after i canceled my trip now i am trying to rebook my trip but i am told i only can use my credit for the ticket and not for the extra bag or seat while i still have extra credit balance available they wont return my money to my credit card and they wont allow me to use it to pay my extra luggage this sounds like cheap low level type of service just as spirit airlines instead of correcting or becoming better i can see a duplicate of a spirit airlines
20409,thomas cook airlines scandinavia,5,thomas cook airlines scandinavia customer review,helfunchalhel on a a321200 the interior is dated but in good shape old style bulky seats with very little legroom it is a charter flight and it shows in the level of service and seat comfort the only thing in common with quality airlines is the cost of the ticket the only reason for flying with such an airline is the nonstop service between helsinki and madeira
4701,atlantic airways,8,a very good flight,copenhagen to vagar in the faroe islands with atlantic airways rc453 a319 aircraft friendly checkin received baggage tag and headed to the gate flight boarded in an organized fashion and flight attendants greeted each passenger as you entered the cabin nice colors and comfortable seats lots of legroom actually was very surprised ontime take off and 2 hours to the faroe islands soda water and coffee serviced complimentary but purchased wine and food was reasonably priced inflight entertainment was just the flightmap but had my dvds to watch landed a few minutes late in crazy wind and rain but the landing was good parked farthest possible on the tarmac from the entrance to the terminal so we all got wet but that is how it is there bags off in a reasonable amount of time oveall a very good flight and for the price a good deal

14220,luxair,9,luxair customer review,luxcdg return on erj 145135 the seats have seen better days but thats my only complaint generous legroom friendly flight attendants and ground staff and tasty croissantsbaguettes served on these shortish 35 min flights give you the feeling of being treated as a real guest onboard flights left and arrived on time
14514,malindo air,2,disappointed with the service,disappointed with the service from the airline first after touch down in kuala lumpur we waiting for our baggage to be on belt for one hour and when asked the ground staff no answer was given and they are not sure was is happening after going home with our luggage during unpacking realised that our luggage cracked have been traveling for so many times this was the first time we encounter this problem

20382,thomas cook airlines,9,i was pleasantly surprised,manchester to san francisco i was wary of flying thomas cook because id never flown with them before and had heard it was something of a discount airline minimum frills but i was pleasantly surprised we had one complimentary meal and tea along with coffeetea interestingly we also got little ice cream cones as a further snack although further fooddrinks had to be purchased this seemed fair considering the low ticket price boarding was smooth we arrived nearly on time and the pilot very kindly pointed out when we were flying over some nice views including greenland i was impressed considering the price and convenience of a direct flight between the uk and sfo
15719,pal express,2,pal express customer review,i have flown several times this year on the bacolod manila route most recently in the last week of may delays are dreadful as they seem to be on other pal express routes some of the delays are due to congestion at manila airport but most are not what makes a frustrating situation worse is the complete inability to keep passengers and those waiting to collect them informed check the airport information screens and they will likely say the departure time was two hours ago check the internet and there is no indication of any delay absolute rubbish once the plane takes off then the seating and service are fine for a budget airline
10829,hainan airlines,7,things that are easy to solve,brussels to beijing return it was my first time using hainan airlines the online reservation was good and the support professional as far as i could experience the food was delicious however when asking for a gin tonic an option on the menu cards it was not available on both flights brupekbru i got 3 different explanations from different flight attendants one of the flight attendants told me that this kind of drink was not demanded regularly and therefore not available in economy class she brought me one from business class afterwards on the return flight the other told me that it was not available by exception just that flight and another flight attendant told me that it would be removed from the menu card afterwards the flight attendant got me one again from business class with no ice or lemon also beer was not cold these seem to be small details but it can have a negative effect on the flight experience these are actually small things that are easy to solve i think better communicating the policy to the flight attendants might avoid 3 different explanations for the same issue
22906,xiamen airlines,5,bad structure of this airline,today i had dinner with my company so i had booked the flight for 9pm the flight was rescheduled to 7pm i missed the dinner because of that came to the airport on time and the flight was deleted one hour this seems to be a joke but its not i see this as a bad management or bad structure of this airline it made my day a very bad day
17303,ryanair,6,quite a good airline for the price,in my experience with flying with ryanair in my opinion it is quite a good airline for the price the seats arent the comfiest but i havent had any bad experiences with them so i would recommend them
22925,xiamen airlines,3,because it was cheaper,just finished a round trip lax qingdao xiamen taipei the return trip didnt involve qingdao i picked this airline because it was cheaper than china and eva air there were actually even cheaper fares with air china and china eastern but i refuse to fly with them due to the horrendous reviews 787 for the long haul were nice planes were fairly new good amount of pitch movie selections were limited but adequate food was terrible for our taste the kids meal for my 11 year old was also mostly inedible service was great however flight attendants had great attitude and seemed to be working nonstop 737 between xiamen and taipei was old and dirty dont understand why they would also offer a meal for such a short flight i hate wasting food but couldnt eat that one either transit at qingdao was confusing we were given the wrong arrival cards twice so had to rewrite them 3 times transit hotel in xiamen was free for our 8 hour layover hotel was not in good shape i would rate it 25 star on our return trip we took the hotel option again and asked if we could pay extra for a better hotel he said no and insisted to give us 3 rooms for the 5 of us then he entered in one of the names wrong on the reservation i now have some personal information of some guy named dustin the hotel this time is a different not as bad maybe a 35 star but both hotels didnt have nonsmoking rooms i overheard another guest requesting a nonsmoking room and was rudely told to come back down and ask for another room she didnt like the room we dont think well fly xiamen again layover in xiamen would be nice if the city had much to offer
12263,jetblue airways,7,incredible customer service,i arrived at airport 15 hours early and did not make flight because of slow workers at airport i made it to the boarding door 60 seconds yes 60 seconds late and they would not let me board man was completely rude again 60 seconds late because of airport workers they gave me another flight almost 4 hours later causing me to miss an important meeting they also did not assign me a seat and instructed me to go to new gate and speak with attendant there she was fantastic explained everything in detail and was super nice with incredible customer service skills she bought me back to jet blue incredible person and deserves many prompts i actually bought her a gift card for her caring and respect of my situation
1734,air france,2,wouldnt have internet for the flight,i will never fly air france again and urge you not to if you have a choice for reference i previously worked for an airline so i am very familiar with flying first for our first short flight our viking cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early this was not air frances fault but air france didnt open their ticket counter for another two plus hours so we couldnt check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time on the long leg of our trip the 85 hour flight we didnt leave until about 30 minutes late we were sitting on the plane and then they didnt tell us until wed already taken off that we wouldnt have internet for the flight i did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours the also didnt have internet on a short leg on our way to barcelona
5571,belavia,6,belavia customer review,prgmsqprg the service was good and crew friendly the food average but tasty aircraft b737500 but a little tired both flights on time nothing special but no complains codeshared flight with czech airlines
1103,air botswana,3,air botswana customer review,jnbgbejnb pleasantly surprised with the flights on atrs considering we were in the middle of rtw fc oneworld unfair comparison cabin crew were ok certainly as good as i would expect the aircraft must have had new paint recently as they looked quite good in and out didnt expect to be flying them no spare pages in passport so sa wouldnt allow me in country
13198,kuwait airways,3,missed the connecting flight,flight departed 1 hour late from the original starting point hence the 1 hour layover at kuwait was missed and hence i missed the connecting flight from kuwait initially the staff didnt take any responsibility and only offered the same flight the next day and hotel accommodation but i had to reach cok urgently after 3 hours of struggle talks and debates a manager turned up and people who didnt have to travel urgently were sent to a hotel and the rest of us were booked onto an alternative airline oman in my case via muscat which would get me to my destination 9 hours later than my original itenary had no choice
18674,south african airways,6,hardworking efficient and cheerful,london to harare via johannesburg left on time seats uncomfortable for a long flight but aircraft not full dinner served beef stew followed by breakfast at the end of the flight cabin crew disappeared during the flight a319 from joburg to harare no empty seats served a snack which was an inedible cheese roll departed harare on airbus 320more room on return flight and served a midday meal tasty and good service on such a short hop to johannes burg a330 from joburg to heathrow a newer plane with much more comfortable seats than the outward flight served an evening meal which was not as good as the outward flight then cabin crew disappeared turbulence so no hot drinks could be served went to the galley to get a coffee obviously this is an unwanted intrusion on crew space did not get the coffee breakfast was later served an amorphous puddle of yellow calling itself an omelette saving grace was the female cabin crew who served us very hardworking efficient and cheerfulthe pilot was good at communicating with the passengers as we went along
21171,turkish airlines,1,will never fly tk again,only one counter for economy class and 1 for business we were queueing for more than 1 hour i will never fly tk again online check in process is burdensome and does not allow to add frequent flyer number of other star alliance members
7925,cubana airlines,6,cubana airlines customer review,yu snu return a320 lease from taca airlines instead of an ilyushin aircraft we chose this airline because it had decent schedules checkin in montreal was normal the legroom was really good for a 3h30 flight safety demo shown on video in spanish with english subtitles announcements onboard also made in french service onboard wasnt the best but it was average however one flight attendant didnt seem to like her job on return flight checkin in santa clara airport was slow and disorganized sure cubana is not a great carrier like air france or lufthansa but its okay
21146,tunisair,4,tunisair customer review,tunfra on a 737600 very good experience although the flight time was relatively short tunisair served a hot meal and complimentary wine altogether much better service than for example german carriers offer on similar routes best of all the flight was considerably cheaper
3791,akasa air,9,quickly turned into a memorable trip,i travelled from bangalore to visakhapatnam with my 2 kids what could have ended up in a travel disaster was quickly turned around by the ground staff into a memorable trip while the flight was comfortable checkin during the peak hours airport rush took me for a ride with kids i arrived a bit late and the counter was closed the groundcheckin staff found an opportunity to fit us in and they did the unthinkable everything happened with lightning speed and we were on the flight finally with few mins to spare i really appreciate their hard work and very thankful for the vip treatment although the baggage arrived a bit late its not a big concern at all i really wish them all the success and growth in their future endeavours
9015,etihad airways,5,staff did absolute minimum only,masks still have to be worn on board that it getting a bit old felt that staff did absolute minimum only much much interaction with guests needed assistance with luggage when boarding accident a flight attendant assisted but i was on my own after landing nobody cared no free wifi in business class food was fine good wheelchair service after landing in abu dhabi
1868,air india,5,nervous about our journey back home,for our 3 seats the entertainment units were not working for my seat the headset was not working and i was told to just read the subtitles by the team member and that this would definitely keep me entertained my friend in the next seats remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight the entertainment units not working on a day flight was frustrating however the team members words were infuriating for us the bathrooms were a mess throughout the journey and the crew were not keen to tidy them up service was slow but professional admittedly nervous about our journey back home next week
10170,frontier airlines,2,dont throw last minute charges,i flew on three separate frontier flights in the space of one week with no food water entertainment it reclining seats before they decided to charge me 40 extra to check my carry on because it was too big on my very last flight it might be low blood sugar and travel fatigue but i have never been more angry at an airline ever in my life i get that you get what you pay for but please be consistent and dont throw last minute charges at the very last leg of the journey
7131,citilink,6,cabin crew is nice,surabaya to makassar i got promo price for this flight great checkin time the checkin counter staff is somewhat but i cant choose the window seat because theres no more window seat available and my seat is the last one on the aisle the flight is on time and crowded the cabin crew is nice smooth flight
5339,bangkok airways,9,very pleased and impressed,bangkok to krabi i had to cancel my flight because of the coronavirus the airline was very difficult to get in touch with by phone so i tried the pg live chat it took 2 days to be able to speak to someone so i was imagining by the time i did speak to someone the quality of the service would be low and i would have to argue my way to a refund but the service was quick and accommodating the representative spoke perfect english she asked why i was getting in touch asked for my flight information and confirmed that she had cancelled my flight for a full refund just moments later she also found in my record that i had purchased travel insurance along with the tickets and told me hold i could get that refunded too now the refund will take 30 days because of the high volume of refund requests so well see if i do in fact get my refund but in terms of quality of customer service im very pleased and impressed
7860,cubana airlines,4,service even more basic,departure from toronto march 31st started off with the check in desks not being ready when i arrived but they set up a little later didnt appear to be any issues with the departure time of 1250 flight ok service ok basic notice no movie screens no ear phones issued no pillows or blankets provided flight went smoothly and arrived at scu on time return was another story entirely ive noted from other reviews that cubana appears to have developed a steady pattern which may now be a practice of not being on time major delays and very poor to no information being communicated to passengers yes airlines experience delays and equipment problems but in this day and age what continues to happen with both of these companies is not acceptable so for the return the 605 departure on april 7th from scu was originally on time but then it was delayed no explanation as to why at approx 730 or 8 an official came into the departure lounge and passengers went to speak with him to find out what was going on we were told the flight wouldnt be leaving until 3 am we asked about being taken out of the airport and accommodated for more comfort etc due to the length of the wait and were told no we asked about food and refreshments and were told that was being organized the timing of the departure changed 3 more times after that moving to 10pm and 11pm that night and then finally an empty jet arrived at 1220 rumour had it that there was a problem with the flight coming down from toronto and it had to turn back same thing with a flight that was allegedly coming from havana we were also told that they had to get permissions in place for our plane to land at toronto in the wee hours of the morning eg 230am once the empty jet landed and we loaded we took off at 130 am service even more basic than the flight coming down drinks and a snack were served but nothing else no duty free offered and again no earphones no movie screens no pillows or blankets we flew without any incident landing in toronto at 530 am a lot of passengers had to miss work school that day because of the toll all of that drama took again by this point in time cubana and hola sun seriously need to pull up their socks and change their ideas and approach towards their schedules and their approach especially with regard to providing better communications and information to the travelling public there are limited airlines that fly into santiago but that doesnt mean cubana has any sort of monopoly and can treat passengers like that
1684,air france,5,personnel attitude make the difference,personnel attitude make the difference on the way to paris see previous review everything went smoothly not on the way back one of the rudest boarding i faced unpolite staff no smile no education it seemed that we were bothering the two ladies we entered the aircraft at a high level of stress turbulences and stress cockpit did not help then
10374,germanwings,9,impressed with germanwings,very impressed with germanwings the flight was punctual crew was professional and polite i traveled smart economy boarding was quick and efficient the aircraft was clean the lavs were spotless there was good legroom and we were given a choice of beverages and substantial snack the arrival was ontime and luggage was delivered promptly

22274,vlm airlines,6,vlm airlines customer review,lcyein the vlm brand is no more but the ticket still stated vlm you have to use the cityjet website planes are in cityjet livery and china and glass have been banished in favour of the bogstandard cardboard cups i tried checking in online but there was a problem with the system i cannot remember the last time the online check in went smoothly with vlmcityjet i eventually managed to do so passage through lcy was quick and efficient due to the extra security theyve installed and the fact it wasnt a busy period but it was a bit manic at the gate as the ground staff didnt seem to know what they were doing consequently we left 20 minutes late once in the air the flight was fine about 70 full cabin crew managed one bar service and one teacoffee service during the short flight and handed out belgian chocolates at least this vlm feature has been retained i dont think vlms standards have slipped due to the takeover by cityjet apart from online check in but the staff at lcy need to get their act together
15649,openskies,3,horrible experience,paris orly to new york jfk with openskies requested seat 4j after waiting for the 24 hours check in period i was trying to avoid being seated next to the toilet upon getting to the airport everything look good and received my boarding ticket with the proper seat then at the gate they decided to change my flight to the only other seat available next to the toilet as they explained that my seat was given to a crew member as you can imagine i was not happy and everything from there was downhill airplane is dated so the seat was uncomfortable and did not recline to a bed as expected food was barely edible and the service was nonexistent horrible experience on an airline that i was looking forward to flying with as this was my first flight with them never again
15331,okay airways,7,okay airways customer review,bk2823 tsnxiy not as bad as i thought very cheap no ife pretty bad meal but still a meal nonetheless aircraft was an older 737800 but was perfectly clean service was efficient but brash chinese regulations mean that you cant use your mobile phone any time during the flight even in flight mode and they do enforce this
14449,malaysia airlines,2,this airline is incredibly poor,this airline is incredibly poor first the flight was delayed three times while already on the plane due to technical issues they claimed to have it fixed three times and three times it failed after spending three hours on the plane and not moving plus dealing with the heat as they wouldnt turn the airconditioning on we were offered the smallest bag of peanuts as compensation i can accept a poor flight however we missed our connecting flight and were put on the next available flight at 330 in the morning ruining our planned transport and accommodation we were given no compensation but the thing that has tipped me over the edge is we decided to buy extra legroom for our return flight after being hung up on we where finally able to book and pay for this then 36 hours later we were charged again for the same amount i have really struggled in dealing with this airline and then to find out that they have held my card details for over 24 hours and felt it acceptable to change us with out consent is disgusting i promise this will be the last time i fly with this airline
6885,china airlines,9,made this flight a memorable one,flight attendants on the ngotpe leg a333 and tpengo b738 surely made this flight a memorable one they were so attentive and despite being taiwanese their japanese language skills were superb tpekultpe was just heaven the decor on the b777300er was well thought out the flight attendant on the kultpe leg went beyond the norm of a normal fa when i asked the brand of the oolong tea served on the aircraft she gladly gave me a tea bag of the one they serve on flight my wife and i did an overnight at taipei but i would definetely recommend and fly china airlines again on my next trip to southeast asia
19927,thai airasia,7,otherwise everything was okay,we flew thaiairasia from bangkok suvanabumi to chiangmai on july 20 2022 the checkin was very good and smooth however when we arrived at the gate the plane has yet to come and we wait for a while the airline ground staff tried to make up for the delay by rushing the passenger to the plane we have to stand in the long line from airport gate to pbb for over 10 minutes unnecessarily otherwise everything was okay
9044,eurowings,2,didnt get any news about my luggage,eurowings lost my luggage on the 2 of july now it is almost week and i didnt get any news about my luggage all my holidays i spent without my medicine clothes swimming suits and clothes for my child now i have to go to the next destination and there is no possibilities to get my luggage there communication with eurowings is very poor i found that a lot of people have the same problems with this airline i am really very unsatisfied with this experience and please be aware before your trip with eurowings
7362,condor airlines,8,mostly a great experience,mostly a great experience toronto to frankfurt then austrian airlines to vienna fare class business upgraded to prime seat nice new a330neo plane lovely livery and the plane still smell new crew were efficient if not overly friendly fluent in english and german menu options were good cold appetizers were nicer than the hot meals but overall no complaints wine selection was good great long haul business class hard product comfortable pod seats with plenty of space and felt fairly private i upgraded to prime seat and had so much space especially in lie flat position able to sleep comfortably love the pyjamas provided comfy and worth keeping boarding was a gong show no sense of organization or dedicated boarding calls for each group just a mass of people trying to board all at once no priority boarding observed overall good experience and certainly cheapest transatlantic business fare i could find i would not necessarily upgrade to prime seats again as other seats in business were equally good
11605,iran air,7,seats were large,i travelled business class of iran air from london and tehran return on an a300 a310 servisair lounge at heathrow was very poor the lounge at tehran was very good and comfortable with a reasonably good selection of food cold and hot drinks although the aircraft was old the seats were large and with ample legroom catering was very good and generous with a good choice of appetisers sides mains and dessert flight attendants were kind and caring
10249,garuda indonesia,5,service could have been much better,denpasar to sydney there is a big difference with garuda depending on the configuration of the aircraft unfortunately this flight was the old configuration and was not a true lie flat bed the ife on garuda is never great but this was as poor garuda also seem to struggle in business class when the flight is full i have to say that the service on this flight could have been much better on boarding there was no introduction by the fa we then had to wait for an hour to get a glass of wine off the crew and this was not replenished without asking as it was a late flight there was not dinner service and the breakfast was tasty but service was haphazard overall not the best experience in business class
2432,air namibia,4,still a dull experience,air namibia flight from cape town to windhoek in economy class i lowered my expectation before flying with them but it was still a dull experience fortunately it was only 2 hour flight the fas seemed really not interested in doing their jobs only good thing was they were not rude the food was abysmal i dont even remember what i had the cleanliness of the plane was below average despite this namibia is a fascinating place so dont let the airline discourage you to come
1160,air canada,2,experienced 11 yes 11 delays,air canada seattle to comox was the worst flight of my life in a short flight from seattle to comox with a connector in vancouver the connector is a 20 minute flight from vancouver to comox i experienced 11 yes 11 delays and gate changes a screen shot cannot show the frustration or physical pain caused by air canadas lacking running through large busy airports gate changes that required taking the tram in seattle to different gates standing in lines of enraged customers to information desks all of us just trying to get to our destinations it looked like a riot may ensue at the vancouver airport in the air canada section employees that were trying hard but also up against a behemoth company that seemed to care as little for them as they do for their customers i kept apologizing to employees for expressing my frustration but i was never offered a manager to talk to i was offered a card with numbers to call i would not last a day as an employee for this company i felt so bad for my fellow canadians that have to work for a company that is so bad that they should not use the word canada in their name i could have made this travel by buses and ferry in about 10 hours my travel by air canada with checkpoints and lines started in seattle before 11am and ended more than 12 hours later my 66 year old back legs and bum still hurt the next day as i write this
12687,kam air,3,kam air customer review,the flight attendants try to do their jobs with a smile food is not bad and while it is perhaps faint praise i have never gotten ill from the food after perhaps 20 flights from dxb to kbl and vice versa the seats are comfortable in business only once has my luggage been left behind and in that case the next day i received a call from kam that my bags had arrived kam is now running a second flight to eliminate the one downside of its dxbkbl flight and that was the 0700 or 0800 departure time now they have a terminal one flight from dxb leaving at 1300 planes need to be newer if possible but they are clean and get the job done
11089,hong kong airlines,7,hong kong airlines customer review,roundtrip from hong kong to okinawa in economy the outbound flight was made on an a330 that was so old that there was no button on the armrest to turn the light on and off i remember this because a flight attendant who saw me reading asked me if i needed her to turn on the light the return trip was on a newer a330 equipped with the latest ife however none of the hollywood movies listed in the airlines magazine was available for viewing so i occupied myself with its games while this was only a 25hour flight full ife was available when i flew with hka on the even shorter route to and from shanghai in 2012 beverage selection was good but food consisted only of a bun wrapped around some meat on both flights perhaps hka expected its passengers to have eaten right before boarding what hka could do right before boarding is to board passengers by row number so that they wont have to form a long queue well before boarding begins and get in each others way inside the plane for short flights three hours or less id recommend hka but mainly because of price
8153,dragonair,4,dragonair customer review,flew dragonair in june 2013 from hk to okinawa japan and vice versa flight was delayed for around one hour for both sectors really could not recommend this airline though its rate charged was not budget in any way the flight certainly felt like a budget flight you had to ask for cushion and blankets there was no inflight entertainment for the 25 hours flight and food given was below par
2689,air panama,6,air panama get the job don,panama city to bocas del torro after reading reviews i was not looking forward to flying air panama but the experience i had with them on the day of the flight was nothing as to what has been written checkin was fast there is no online checking available as far as i could find the plane was an old fokker 50 boarding was fast we had to walk from the terminal to the plane once in the plane you could see the age and there was a nasty smell onboard we departed 15 minutes early the seats were comfortable and plenty of legspace it was a 40 minute flight a drink and snack were served by 2 friendly flight attendants air panama get the job done and i didnt have horrible service described by other people it was fast and efficient nothing more and nothing less maybe an upgrade in their fleet could do magic for themy
1796,air india,2,again bad experience,unfortunately again experiencing this airline and its airconditioning not working we all are sitting and waiting for more than 40 minutes in plane without airconditioning right away again bad experience
8267,easyjet,4,no mention of compensation,ive flown with easyjet a few times before and never had any problems not on 1st june though at least they told me via the app that my flight had been delayed from 1800 to 2050 albeit id already set off for the airport spent nearly 5 hours in manchester airport never a pleasant experience but 5 hours apologies from the staff at the gate and on the plane but no mention of compensation refreshments etc landed at venice airport too late for my courtesy shuttle bus or for public transport and had to get a taxi to my hotel cost 50 got to bed so late that wasnt fit to do much the next day so day wasted now applying for compensation
20337,thomas cook airlines,7,seats extremely uncomfortable,manchester to los angeles we flew premium outbound and economy inbound as no premium seats available premium ok for what we paid and tolerable for 11 hour flight economy seats extremely uncomfortable despite having exit seats dont recline narrow and not tall enough for tall people on both legs food portions and type were inadequate for the length of the journey we were hungry not enough drinks service lights are put out and youre encouraged to sleep only pro is cost in comparison to other airlines direct flight and on time staff were fine
16424,qantas airways,2,impossible to deal with,we paid a premium price to fly business class from london heathrow to melbourne with a short stop over in perth for refuelling we were bumped off the plane and waited for six hours in perth for a plane to arrive from melbourne to allow us to continue our journey our plane was high jacked for a return flight to london we arrived in melbourne over seven hours late with no apology in accordance with eugb departing plane legislation we submitted our legally entitled claim of 524 per person qantas customer service have been impossible to deal with and clearly obstructive we have now submitted a complaint to the caa
5982,breeze airways,8,flight times are also convenient,breeze specializes in flights out of secondary markets like my home airport of richmond i would probably fly them just for the direct flights to the west being able to go directly to arizona without needing to connect is a gamechanger the flight times are also convenient as well unlike jetblue which showed its disdain for richmond by scheduling its since canceled flight from richmond to la at 9 pm breeze schedules its west coast flights so that they leave east coast midmorning and get back before its too late at night but what i really like is that upgrading to their nicest cabin with a first class seat is very reasonable maybe 100 each way the ability to fly nonstop and in comfort makes breeze a winning proposition there are some things they could do better theres no wifi or ife on the plane and the flights only run twice a week so its not always possible to use breeze if your schedule doesnt match up but i hope these are growing pains that they will resolve as they continue to grow and become more successful
6250,bulgaria air,3,flight felt like an eternity,sofia to lisbon this four hour flight felt like an eternity legroom was better than on their a320s but still insufficient i emptied the pocket in front of my so there would be more space available food was good but not enough there are no pillows on bulgaria air landed on time
9214,eva air,5,damage to covers is not compensated,seoul to taipei the flight experience itself is very correct however at arrival in tpe i went to fetch my baggage and noticed that the new cover i bought as a protector for my rimowa was damaged and i can no longer use it eva ground staff said that damage to covers is not compensated cannot understand this because it also costs money 50 also when sending an email i get a standard email that they are looking forward for my patronage again ill choose to fly other airlines instead
9552,firefly,5,firefly customer review,sinkuasin with family 1 child 1 infant infant seat belts were offered unlike tiger and air asia atr72500 were new capacity 72 pax drinks oj or apple juice peanuts and muffins served with 2 fas drinks were done 2 rounds in the 1 hr flight fas were friendly and customer service orientated air sick bags and inflight mag were avail in each seat flight to kuantan about 98 full while flight to singapore was about 90 full seats were arranged 2x2 there was 1 toilet available we paid for s70 for the promotion return airfares overall we enjoyed the flights and will not hesitate to fly with them again
2559,air new zealand,1,thanked for their incredible service,after a long work day my flight home was cancelled due to bad weather id had a series of unpleasant personal events earlier that week so this was the cherry on top for me i was only in wellington for the day so had nothing with me and no place to stay so felt rather overwhelmed and was upset the air nz staff member male who was working at 6pm on wed 17 august turned my day around reassured me and provided my with a taxi voucher dinner and food vouchers and a hotel stay this man was compassionate and kind and provided amazing service id like to make sure he gets the recognition he deserves but also that air nz is thanked for their incredible service my experience with the airline staff was pivotal to my week and i am extremely grateful
7745,csa czech airlines,9,staff was nice and friendly,prague to copenhagen flight was operated by czech airlines a319 reg okmel not with lowcost smartwings 737 like almost all other csa flights departure was delayed only about 10 minutes we arrived on time staff was nice and friendly ordered food was so expensive 260czk but delicious aircraft was clean and seats were comfortable
17758,scoot,3,agent refused to check alternative dates,scoot offers 1st change of date free due to covid when you book on the airlines own website however when you try to rebook it shows you much higher fares and claim those are the best available then a curious customer like me opens a new window does not login searches the fare for the same date on scoots own website and sees lower fares i contacted scoot support and was told to delete cookies from my browser then that i am too late to change my flight which i was not and then to hang on the line while the agent supposedly checked time zones and then the agent was able to process the change but with a fluctuating fee from nowhere which was automatically calculated on the backend and which eventually converged on less than eur10 the agent refused to check alternative dates where i would not have to pay any surcharge not the fault of the service agent
11266,iberia express,1,missed my connection in paris,my flight was originally on delta from salt lake city to madrid for both business and pleasure due to delta leaving 35 hours late i missed my connection in paris and as all the delta partner flights were booked going down to madrid that evening they put me on an iberia flight this gave me a 4 hour layover or so in paris so you would think my luggage would have arrived it didnt i figured it would show up a day or so later because how do you lose luggage for longer than that and i made the mistake of only making only one pair of underclothes and two shirts in my backpack as the days progressed with no luggage i was told by iberia to hold onto my receipts for reimbursement as i had to by clothes i could wear for my conference makeup and some clothes for the vacation portion of my trip i didnt go wild finally on the 9th day of no luggage they contacted me to say it was found and now in madrid that didnt help as i was in barcelona i instructed them to send it to my home in utah to which they told me they would send me the shipping information they never did three days later there was a knock at my door at 450 am that freaked me out because i wasnt expecting anyone it ended up being my luggage luckily it was all there unfortunately the story doesnt end there when the iberia representative told me to hang onto my receipts he gave me an email address to send all my documentation i did so knowing that reimbursement could take up to 30 days after 3 weeks of radio silence from iberia i contacted them to check the status and they said they never received my paperwork they gave me a new email address and i resubmitted again this time i saw emails from them saying they were processing and i could expect a check in approximately 30 days fast forward to this week at day 36 i called them and was told that they couldnt help me that i would need to lodge a complaint through their website i immediately did and received an email that said it could take up to 21 days to respond when i got home that day there was a check in the mail for less than half of the amount submitted ive since contacted them without response the customer service of this airline is unbelievably horrible as iberia was the airline i last flew with when the luggage went missing according to airline regulations they are responsible for whatever happens to it
17985,sichuan airlines,9,impressed by the quality of service,ive been on many flights and i must say that ive been very impressed by the quality of service displayed by sichuan airlines cabin crew were very kind and made me feel at home pilot flying skills were pretty good i must say this was actually one of the most stable flights ive been on with limited turbulence and i felt very safe
17010,royal brunei airlines,7,good value for money,flew royal brunei airlines from london to melbourne via dubai and brunei based on price alone and pleasantly surprised by the service provided food was generally good entertainment good and staff very pleasant dry aircraft was not an issue and indeed stops a lot of unpleasantness evident on some other flights due to passengers consuming too much alcohol the stop in dubai is a bit of a nuisance but allow you to stretch your legs seats are okay but get a bit hard after many hours but no worse than others overall good value for money and would use them again brunei airport is not very good but okay for a couple of hour stop
8836,ethiopian airlines,3,i will not be flying et again,flight from nairobi to addis was okay albeit 40 minutes late landing after having to hold due to bad weather in addis took ages to disembark in addis as they parked at a remote stand and there seemed to be a shortage of passenger buses transit in addis is always a shambles massive queues at the security checkpoint with multiple lanes unmanned and extremely slow screening boarding is always chaotic at bole airport especially if the aircraft is at a remote stand and you have to be taken by bus to the aircraft took off an hour late for khartoum and after an interminable wait for baggage after landing discovered that the airline had left more than half the passenger baggage in addis so they could carry more cargo as evidenced by the dozens of boxes that arrived on the luggage conveyor as compared to very few suitcases basically sitting in khartoum with just the clothes on my back now with absolutely no idea whenif my luggage will actually get here i will not be flying et again
2546,air new zealand,3,you may not receive a refund or hear anything,my recent flights with air new zealand for work and personal have been relatively easy service was good only slightly delayed the fares however vary enormously my advice is to book well ahead however this complaint is about a flight i did not take from christchurch to wellington on july 17 for work it was canceled at the last minute because of covid because my meeting was scheduled for that morning i could not take a later flight the service person at the airport was very helpful i later tried to claim a refund online for my seat reservations and advised of the cancelation the booking was done through my work which has also been trying to get in touch to claim the refund now i completely understand that air new zealand has been facing ongoing severe problems because of the pandemic but it would be good to get a refund or even to be able to contact the airline wait times for the call centre apparently are up to five hours i emailed them and received a reply one month after the cancelation to apologize for the delay since then neither myself or my workplace have heard anything a warning to passengers if your flight gets canceled through no fault of your own you may not receive a refund or hear anything this is deplorable air new zealand customer for 50 years
8962,etihad airways,6,somewhat pleasant 14 hour,overall as expected from a 4 star fullservice carrier the luggage allowance of 30kg for discount economy flyers proved more generous than expected as my two pieces of baggage totalled up to about 32kgs yet the gate agent still didnt raise any issues or charge me any additional luggage fees as expected the 777s within etihads fleet are somewhat dated interior wise where since the particular aircraft first flight in 2012 after looking up its registration took its maiden flight it is most likely the interior has not been renovated since this doesnt prevent the crew from still delivering on a somewhat pleasant 14 hour flight tho with 2 full meals and snacks in between the only downside is the lack of a selfservice snack bar in the galley of the aircraft which made finding a quick bite or even trying to grab some water after sleeping particularly difficult with all that in mind and considering the relatively affordable price point makes the flight still one worth recommending
18302,singapore airlines,5,seats were super uncomfortable,im a vegetarian the food was tasty but i have some thoughts a bun served with butter without any addition in one of the main meals i had to ask for a drink because the service walked by multiple times ignoring me i flew with them 4 times two flights of 145 hours plus 2 shorter flights on 1 out of 4 flights i can say that the service was at a high level the seats were super uncomfortable the number of drinks served for 145 hours is really poor the last drink i asked for was water and the staff brought me a tap water
12381,jetstar airways,1,give this airline a miss,worst airline i travelled with in in my life had a holiday in queenstown new zealand and booked a scoot flight to sydney from singapore and a jetstar flight to queenstown from sydney at the start of my trip i faced no issues entering sydney with my valid australian electronic travel authority eta and was promptly cleared by immigration after which i took my jetstar flight to queenstown and did not encounter any issue as well at the end of my queenstown holiday i arrived promptly at queenstown airport to checkin for my jetstar flight back to sydney where i would then take a scoot flight a couple of hours later from sydney to my final destination singapore at the jetstar checkin counter at queenstown airport i was asked to present my australian eta which i did and was told by the jetstar staff that there was an issue with my eta because my full name was stated in the family name field and told me to apply for a new eta right then and there flabbergasted as i had not encountered an issue with my eta that had allowed me entry into australia twice before most recent being the start of my holiday and my eta only expired in mar 2023 i did as i was told and started to apply for a new eta using the australian eta app as retrieval of passport information via the app is by scanning the chip in the passport my full name autopopulated in the family name field and could not be edited even on the app it explicitly said for some passport types the applicants given name will appear in the family name field please do not rescan the applicants passport in these cases as the information is displaying correctly i highlighted this to the jetstar staff and was then told to not use the app to apply for a new eta and to do via the website instead which went contrary to what was written on the website from 6 april 2022 all etaeligible passport holders can now apply for an eta using the australian eta app at this time eta lodgement is only available through the australian eta app long story short as i was not able to reconcile this alleged issue at checkin the jetstar staff informed that she would not be able to check me in for my flight and hence i missed my jetstar flight back to sydney which meant that i also missed my scoot flight from sydney back to singapore given that i had to return to singapore asap i had to spend about sgd2000 for a oneway lastminute flight ticket back to singapore from queenstown and also spent about sgd300 for an unintended additional nights stay in queenstown given that the next available flight was the next day lodged a complaint to jetstar requesting for an explanation and was informed that it would take up to 15 days for the resolutions team to get back to me 15 days came and gone and i again followed up with jetstar who informed that it would take another 5 days to process 5 days have passed and i have yet to receive any word from jetstar without a response jetstar is now impeding my ability to take other necessary actions with other entities that will help me with this monetary loss related to travel disruption give this airline a miss bad experience and you will end up losing money paying for additional costs that would not have arisen had you taken another airline to your destination
14014,lot polish airlines,2,received seats in 3 different rows,this was my last flight with this airline one reservation id with 3 people there under 1 last name and we received seats in 3 different rows of course you can choose seats by paying extra money in advance but if you dont do this you will be seated in different parts of the plane even contact with customer care did not help and whats more we were not the only ones impacted by this algorithm even children with parents had seats not close to each other this was 9 hours flight
12109,jet2com,8,look at different companies,tenerife to stansted we have no issues with the flight or crew on the flight both were brilliant however we did find one of the reps at the hotel hard rock tenerife on saturday 7th december who was handling the luggage transfers i found not in keeping with good customer service i thought we had booked the whole package via jet 2 but it appeared that i had booked through expedia so not able to use this service even though flying with jet2com her colleague was helpful and friendly and explained the situation but the rep was quite rude not verbally but when looking on the paperwork and seeing i had booked through expedia she quickly walked over to her colleague who was on the phone to the office and pointed at the fact it was booked through expedia and pulled a face we were planning on bringing our family back sometime next year but will now look at different companies
15269,norwegian,9,a great product for the price,have flown norwegian over 30 times in the last year both short haul and long haul this trip was a long haul from san fran to stockholm via london i am a big fan of the airline almost always on time very friendly crew especially in the long haul operation free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type both short and long haul and operates gate to gate so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing the premium offering long haul is i would say better than most airlines premium economy but not as good as business class yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get essentially you pay about a normal airlines economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy the food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep although this is not a lie flat bed per business class the ife is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline whilst norwegian are no ryanair it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline you are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules if your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg or 15kg in premium they will make you pay to check it in in economy you dont get a meal unless you preorder and pay short haul they are more flexible with the rules on baggage but long haul they always check overall a great product for the price
16501,qantaslink,9,qantaslink customer review,i took flight qf1509 from sydney to hobart and flight qf1502 from hobart to melbourne both flights were on the b717200 the departure and arrival on both flight was on time despite only having two cabin crew on board the customer service was great and they were happy to help i would definitely take qantaslink if i have the chance
12386,jetstar airways,1,never fly this airline again,they dont answer your calls respond to live chat or even turn up at the airport to tell you your flight is cancelled what i witnessed tonight at ho chi minh airport deeply disturbed me old people families budget travellers queuing up in preparation for a flight coming to the realisation after no one turned up or messaged up or contacted anyone that no flight was leaving i will never fly this airline again
67,adria airways,7,adria airways customer review,zrh to lju as a continuation to a flight with swiss adria were not as good as swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us the return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers the crj was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment i have flown in the past
3216,airasia,1,canceled due to operational reasons,i bought a ticket through airasia website for a flight on the 21st of august sunday from chiang mai to kuala lumpur i received an email last saturday notifying me that the flight had been canceled due to operational reasons i tried to understand what these reasons were but i could only contact an automated bot i eventually got to talk with a socalled live agent had to wait in queue for 3 hours that pretended he was typing the 3 dots premessage symbol showed up for like 5 minutes and eventually the conversation expired i came to understand that the flight they sold me ak 857 doesnt operate on sundays i have another ticket bought from them for the 25th august thursday from kl to krabi ak 868 and i already checked flightaware and found out that the flight only operates on monday wednesday and friday i asked for a refund for the flight that got cancelled by airasia but so far i havent got my money back and from the looks of it im understanding that the same situation will arise with the kl to krabi flight dont trust airasia flights and always check on several sites if the flights actually exist and operate on the days they are selling them
13604,laudamotion,2,arrived almost three hours late,friday afternoon flight from sandefjord torp to vienna very few people in lines before security so we went through in a couple of minutes we sat there waiting and then plane delayed one and a half hour delay the plane came and the boarding took time cause every passenger shall stow away two or three pieces of luggage plus jackets caps scarfs etc we bought priority boarding but that is a joke we all stood in the same line for boarding you can bring an extra bag though the plane had to deice so that delayed the flight further after takeoff the crew turn up the temperature in the cabin so they can work in short arm shirts all the passengers had to take off the pullovers in the narrow cabin we arrived in vienna almost three hours late
8014,delta air lines,2,complete lack of care for customers,delayed multiple times had myself wife and 7 year old was delayed due to not having a crew there to fly us home missed work had 5 hrs delay and delta only offered us 50 the meals alone were more than that will not be flying with them again after the way they treated us only communication is through email never can get anyone on the phone was told next time to go to red coats for meal voucher which we did and they said they will be issued at our home airport when we got there they knew nothing about what we were talking about complete lack of care for customers
15534,omni air international,9,staff and service were excellent,ramstein air force base germany to baltimorewashington flew as spacea on the amc usaf patriot express or informally freedom bird seats were narrow as would expect for transporting physically fit soldiers but adequate legroom departure delayed for two hours for technical reasons but better safe than sorry since flight over atlantic ocean precludes any emergency diversion and landing all seatback electronics functioned cabin staff and service were excellent supper from germany not us was to european standards quite good not the untasty us airline food and had a real breakfast not a snack as on the inadequate other charter company outbound crew was attentive gracious and always helpful overall much better than usflagged carriers and up to european standards although flew as military retired at minimal cost i would be pleased to pay fullprice ticket for the service rendered on this flight
5308,bamboo airways,9,fas were all turkish women,hanoi to hue 5th january on an a320200 purchase online was easy and very clear without any hidden costs a minor reschedule was clearly informed and adjustable weeks before departure check in smooth though long queues despite 10 counters open had to wait 40 minutes to be checked in got offered seat and chose an exit seat as flight was only half full no issue with luggage like for other low cost carriers especially the vietjetair extremely strict luggage policies with several checks in airports onboard 4 fas and 2 service attendants for 80 passengers the fas were all turkish women while the sas were vietnamese and acted mainly as translators given water tissue magazines i brought my own coffee sachets to get expresso onboard 8 business class seats were empty flight on time bus gating in both ends extremely good value for money paid 33 usd attendant were very talkative and extrovert no ife on board but flight took only 70 minutes bamboo airways have their logos and branding everywhere onboard with nice decorations and new uniforms etc even the drinking water were produced labelled and marketed by the airline bamboo is considered as an lcc carrier but compares to a 3star legacy carrier a meal or at least a snack would have been nice but hard to claim for the price paid
19279,sun country airlines,2,lack of efficiency lack of response lack of resources to aid customers,supposed to return to dfw on july 1 2021 they told us it was delayed no problem we get there the sy staff informs us its cancelled and if we need a hotel we declined and asked our next steps they told us to just go home and wait for an email and said they were unable to book flights mildly frustrating i understand flights get cancelled but the staff essentially told us to just go home and wait for someone to reach out to us which still hasnt happened in over 14 hours been on hold with sy for over an hour put my number into the call back list over 8 hours ago and havent received any call back extremely frustrating we receive an email saying well get a voucher for a new flight within 10 business days absolutely unacceptable a couple of extra days sure maybe 10 business days stranded is just plain wrong no other phone number works so i went back to the airport to get some additional information all of the staff left no sy agent anywhere in the airport as of right now we are stuck at our current destination with no idea of when we can return to dfw as we havent heard anything and cannot get a hold of anyone to help us with our issue the unprofessionalism lack of efficiency lack of response and lack of resources to aid customers is disappointing i can say with confidence i will never fly with this airline again ive had other flights cancelled with american and other airlines and they handled it with haste and professionalism i have seen neither here
13560,latam airlines,4,not good at all,london to santiago via madrid we flew with latam from london to chile and back and also took several flights within chile on the plus side the crew were all friendly and efficient like many airlines the food and drink service is minimal now so it feels like a low cost airline the ticketing website and associated online services are a shambles and the whole system needs a thorough upgrade we werent able to check in online for any of our 9 flights despite the system recognising the booking reference and our name it just kept generating spurious and meaningless error messages and suggesting we try again later not good at all
4529,arik air,7,arik air customer review,lagos to jfk business class new a340 the seat was lay flat and fairly spacious cabin almost empty while economy was full even so the crew had trouble remembering to bring my food and never got around to headphones the food they remembered to bring was fair to good in seat power made up for thin avod so one could watch computer movie seat controls a bit contrived but functional arik was only airline in lagos to take a credit card even though the purchase process was painful check in very confused but that seems to be the lagos airport staff still a better experience than the us airlines international service
9154,eva air,5,a comfortable ride,it was a comfortable ride the seats are not bad you get what you pay for cabin crews are helpful food quality is alright about the same as pre pandemic inflight entertainment is mediocre with a limited selections of movies and shows still its worth flying with eva air if you are planning to fly taiwan
12945,korean air,2,they switched up on us at the last minute,i am traveling with 12 people and we have already reserved our seat we planned out who is sitting where on the plane because we have 3 little kids with us and we wanted to make sure they are comfortable on the 6 hours flight when did check again for our seat an hour before going to the airport and everything was the same but when we got to the airport during our luggage checkin they told use that our seats have been changed our group of 12 people were scattered around the airplane it was so difficult for my 3 and 5 year old to seat during the flight because we did not get the window seat that we reserved we did ask people to switch but they did not want to switch this is so horrible did not like how they switched up on us at the last minute
3473,airasia x,5,it was really great,perth to bangkok via kuala lumpur my wife and kids flew on airasia and were quite delighted with the lie flat seats and service on board it was really great thank you the food though needs a little work and could be improved on a negative though is the communication using the app we were charged for lounge access when it should have been included in premium it does seem the booking system makes errors with charging and i see on the return we are being charged for food when we selected that option in our fare in essence there is a lot over double charging which i dont appreciate i have just tried the app to complain and it says i have already completed a form yet i have not it is a shame because it seems that are getting a lot right in the air a pity that the systems lead to overcharging and frustration
11334,icelandair,7,my first time on icelandair was good,my first time on icelandair was good thanks to the checkin crew all my baggage was free for checkin the seating was okay but the inflight entertainment was very modest with little excitement or a variety of options all i had was nothing but free drinks
21062,tuifly,5,tuifly customer review,manstrman another more or less perfect set of flights from one of the best low cost carriers around able to do online check in and get seats at the front for the outward journey middle seat was empty flight left early and landed 10 mins early at stuttgart on the way back flight landed 30 mins early tuifly also offer the option to prebook a snack which i did includes soft drinkhot drink and this is something other lccs should offer in fact for a lcc tuifly offers a great level of service no charge for checking in luggage allocated seating newspapers and low fares plus friendly attentive flight attendants 30 was all i paid for this weekend trip so compared to ryanaireasyjet etc tuifly wins hands down
4374,ana all nippon airways,9,she was outstanding,my step son flew from san francisco to manila via tokyo on april 13th due to the covid the philippines required a updated form and he was not able to make the flight on april 122022 i called ana and the woman i spoke with was wonderful i lost connection talking with her at 4 am the next morning she called me back and was able to rebook my stepson on the next available flight there was no additional charge and she was able to take care of everything i wish i had gotten her name since she was outstanding and would like ana to know
59,adria airways,5,adria airways customer review,i fly at least once a month zrhljuzrh my experience is that the staff on the ground need a better education regarding how to care of passengers if it comes to a delay and pax have to go to the info desk to change tickets and so on then you really see of how unfriendly and unprepared staff are the airplanes could be cleaned better and i do also see some room for improvement for the flight staff
1459,air china,7,good service for cheap price,the journey started with very friendly ground staff at frankfurt airport both legs were smooth and pleasant flights the seats are ok for long distance flights they have been a bit hard for me which was uncomfortable during the last two hours of the first leg the ife offered a nice selection of chinese and international movies and series compared to other airlines it was a smaller selections but enough for an entertaining flight in multiple languages the cabin crew was nice and never acted bothered or unfriendly they had an open ear for the passengers the only little thing that has been noticed is the english language of the crew it was challenging to understand them due a very strong accent the crew did their best but for unexperienced speakers it would be tough to understand the food on both flights has been good for economy both warm food options and the snack was very tasteful the connection at beijing airport was fast and as comfortable as possible after security the waiting area for transit passengers offered a good view of the gates and lots of vending machines and snack and coffeshop air china positively surprised me with their good service for cheap price
4846,austrian airlines,2,there is zero assistance by austrian,first time with austrian airlines and it will definitely be my last my flight was venice to dubrovnik with a layover in vienna their customer service is a joke they all just have scripted answers and redirect you to fill out forms on the website its like talking to a robot ive called numerous times without any success you request for a supervisor and they say there is none available no matter when you call i held for an hour today my partner and i were on a week long trip across europe and i was planning to propose in dubrovnik but then austrian airlines have delayed our luggage when we had landed and most likely lost the luggage my proposal and trip has now been ruined as my partner had to return to seattle for their portion of the trip for work while i had to spend a full day of my remaining vacation spending extra money on getting new clothes toiletries because im going to be here for four more weeks across european countries which im told theyre going to only reimburse 50 of clothes and 100 of toiletries but its probably going to be a great hassle to get out of them considering everything else lately im never checking a bag again because of this and encourage no one else to ask well this is gross negligence and they take no accountability or action even when i did check in my baggage i had issues as well i tried to buy online for 30 per bag and the website kept giving an error which i showed the error and charges to the check in at the airport and she still did not honor the price and made us pay 5000 per bag to then lose said bags and destroy a proposal and vacation now im spending half my time on vacation stressed out trying to do everything i can to at least have my bags found and sent home and there is zero assistance by austrian never fly with them and i would definitely suggest never checking your baggage
11002,hong kong airlines,1,regularly cancel their flights,vancouver to beijing via hong kong hong kong airlines is the worst airline to book flights with because they regularly cancel their flights and do not care about what passengers have booked with them i booked a flight in sept of this year for travel in march and hong kong airlines cancelled our flights to hk and beijing right off costing me additional costs to make changes to our hotels at the end they offered me a full refund 3 months prior to departure when i had booked my flights 6 months prior and their cs did not even bother to look up any other reasonable flight changes with other partner airlines to make my original arrival and departure dates work i told them the reason i booked my flights in advance was to get the travel plans fully secured on exact dates and offering me a refund now would be useless as it would be impossible for me to find similar flights now the cs did not seem to give a damn do not fly with them
889,air astana,3,not the worst but not the best,air astana has practically a monopoly in the central asian region where i live and work and they dont hesitate to remind the customer of that i have travelled approximately 75100 legs on this airline for business and have purchased several tickets to and from moscow for both myself and my fiance youd think this sort of loyalty is it really loyalty when you consider the lack of available options would earn me a little more respect than what i received today but judging from my experience with the gate agents contracted by the airline at various airports all i seem to get is ignorance and hostility customer service is arguably not very highly esteemed in central asia in my experience so im long past expecting service with a smile i was caught unawares today by a excess baggage fee when flying out of dushabe apparently air astana has recently started offering bare bones fares whose limitations are in no way reflected in the pricing these fares offer a downright insulting 1 kg baggage limit 10kg for nomad club silver members when the standard tickets allow for 20kg 30kg respectively i unknowingly booked this fare through a thirdparty website where there was no indication that this wasnt a standard fare ticket as i said the ticket price wasnt particularly cheap i expect this sort of thing from flydubai or wizz air but from a national flagship airline seriously of course what incentive do you have to treat repeat customers well when you practically have a governmentbacked monopoly and about the nomad club its quite possibly the stingiest airline rewards program there is almaty airport the airlines hub is a glorified bus station which is insanely overcrowded overpriced and boring on a positive note the air crew staff are polite if not exceedingly not the worst but not the best
18585,smartwings,4,a dismal experience,london gatwick t0 prague with smartwings useless online check in not working because its a codeshare huge queue two staff no time for breakfast seat already booked had to ask firmly for it to be changed very unimpressive they were also very inflexible about the cabin baggage i dont think that they understand that were customers not cattle never again a dismal experience
21825,virgin america,9,the service was great,virgin america from washington dulles to san francisco the inflight entertainment was good and cabin crew very friendly the seat back monitors allowed you to order drinks right then and there the drinks are free and although the food is not the prices are very reasonable seats are comfortable as for leg room i am only 58 so i dont really have problems with leg room but from the looks of it somebody of average height would have a good amount of leg room the ground crew were nice and the checkin was smooth and fast the only remotely negative things about virgin america are that the remotes are a bit challenging to use just me being picky and that it is more expensive than most airlines for a transcontinental domestic flight with that being said though you get what you pay for and the service was great
4325,american eagle,4,great legroom,san francisco to los angeles on time and quick and efficient at check in and at the boarding gate great legroom because we somehow got put into the extra legroom seats comfy seat for the quick one hour flight down to lax i was shocked as an australian there is no proper welcome when you step onboard the plane directing you to your seat for takeoff and landing in australia you must have the window shade up but as we were coming in to land in lax not one of the cabin crew came and asked to open the window shade i could recline in economy during takeoff and landing
19932,thai airasia,9,very reasonable price,booked last minute phuketbangkok flights my friend and i had hand baggage only so very reasonable price check in and boarding really quick and efficient phuket domestic terminal very modern and pleasant cabin crew very smart and aircraft in very good condition don muang airport eerily quiet return flight equally well organised and efficient
12827,kenya airways,2,service continues to get worse,i have taken kenya airways a number of times and it is quite disappointing that instead of improving the service continues to get worse the food served remains almost inedible and inflight entertainment is virtually nonexistent due to covid they cancelled my tickets unfortunately proved to be a horrendous experience as customer service is virtually nonexistent the airline doesnt respond to emails and the telephones indicated on their website does not get picked it did not help that one is left with no option since they closed their offices this airline needs to be more responsive to its customers it seems to want to be known literally to go with the notion of polepole or slowly if it is to get itself out of its reported financial woes due to plunging customer numbers
10254,garuda indonesia,6,hopefully it was just a oneoff,jakarta to sydney i used bid upgrade to get the business seat in this flight and perhaps that was the reason i felt ignored unlike few previous experience with garuda when we purchased the business class tickets outright all the ground experience was fine on boarding the fa came around offering drinks and taking notes on what the breakfast choice to be then i went off sleeping until i heard sounds of plates and cutlery as sign of they were starting serving breakfast i was not served my breakfast even though i turned my seat upright fas just walked pass me back and forth at first i thought i should just wait maybe mine will come soon it did not until we landed no one asked if id like anything to drink i had to ring the bell to ask for a cup of coffee and it was too late to ask for breakfast then once we landed the fa who took my order came to me and said i was sleeping soundly that she did not want to wake me up hence i skipped breakfast the fact that i sat there the entire time they served breakfast and kept asking my neighbor passengers what else theyd like felt like an insult to me would i fly with garuda again yes if we are flying to indonesia but never use the big upgrade anymore its such a shame that i have always recommended them before as we have always received great hospitality prior hopefully it was just a oneoff occasion and not a new trend for garuda
2831,air seychelles,6,hardly any leg room,uncomfortable hardly any leg room and the cabin was so hot that it made it almost unbearable to be on the flight from abu dhabi to the seychelles however on the return flight with air seychelles it was much better with a cooler cabin and much nicer staff there were not as many passengers on the way back so we got to lay across the seats and sleep dont bother getting the front seats have dont have anymore room than the ones behind
1112,air burkina,4,aircraft was in terrible shape,i was booked to fly non stop from abidjan to ouagadougou burkina faso with air burkina their website was surprisingly easy to maneuver and in a few minutes my etkt was issued i guess i was smart to ask the concierge at my hotel in abidjan to confirm my flight the day beforeair burkina had my emailbut no notices whatsoever re the dramatic changeto my unpleasant surprise he was told my flight was cancelled and i was rebooked on a different flight at 0800 rather than 1115 i was at the check in counters at 0600 per the instructions of the reservation office in abidjan im sure the concierge understood well the new information he received from air burkinas office to my unpleasant surprise i was refused to be checked in and was told to wait as there is a problem with my ticket i waited patiently till all passengers were checked in and then i was told by hand signs no english spoken by the check in supervisor that the flight is full and to go and see the agents at air burkinas office in the terminal there i was told by an agent that im booked on a different flight at 3pm i insisted that i had a seat on the early morning flight as i trusted the information i got from the hotel in the city i was promised i had a seat at 3pmbut already i had my doubts at that point i asked why they didnt accept me on the 0800 flight as they cancelled my original flight and even if i had no reservation per their version i thought i was entitled to standby for the morning flight no was the answer reason the flight was stopping in accra where it was going to be filled up 100 i told the agents that i thank them for their efforts and i am not going to wait 8 hours at the airport for maybe flying at 3pm i left their office trying to figure out a way out of ivory coast as i had a business class ticket on ethiopian from ouagadougou to addis ababa and hoped ethiopian airlines would reissue my ticket to fly from abidjan to addis suddenly i was approached by the air burkina agent who offered me to pay penalty for a flight change from 3pm to 8 am of 50euro i had to pay air burkina 50 euro because they cancelled my flight amazing the 100 full flight from accra excuse was no longer an issue i decided to pay despite the convoluted business conduct of air burkina so i dont miss my visit to burkina faso for 50 euro i paid and quickly was rushed to the aircraft out of accra there were at least 20 empty seats and business class was 100 empty so much for correct information the aircraft was an ex lot airliner in terrible shape torn seats dirty cabin toilets without toilet paper drinks were served from abidjan to accras 30 minute flightand a hot tasty meal was offered on the 1 hour flight from accra to ouagadougou quite impressive service what a poor show of caring for customers at abidjan airport and their website says that the customer is at the center of all they do really
17510,sata air azores,2,worst customer service ever,worst customer service ever flight has been cancelled 3 times so far and was never offered a refund as per eu regulations got pushed into accepting a voucher and now that i am demanding a refund after going through 18 months of cancellations they are telling me because i accepted a voucher they cannot give a refund they do what they want with you this will be the last time i ever fly with sata
13178,kuwait airways,1,the worst airline ever,london to islamabad via kuwait well probably the worst airline ever check in staff allocating us 12 of us seats to every single corner of the plane my wife was lucky to have a seat with our little ones secondly due to delay we were rushed to our seats and hand baggage was placed everywhere food was excellent but our entertainment screens turned off mid air along with the assistance button system failure or something on top of all that they lost our one piece of luggage on the way to pakistan and as well as coming back if this is the last plane to catch i will not catch it definitely avoid kuwait as well rude behaviour of airport staff and one star airport service
5870,bmi regional,9,bmi regional customer review,bruedibru in economy ontime flights on comfortable aircraft including free refreshments and bar service luggage waiting on the belt when arriving in luggage hall in edi and bru and that is a very rare experience in bru a pity this route will be discontinued from january
11809,japan airlines,8,comfortable premium economy,jal provided a comfortable premium economy cabin their product is enhanced by business lounge access at lhr and haneda the flight attendants were very attentive i did not use the wifi the food was identical to economy but was functional the only challenge was a not great selection of inflight entertainment in my view
9578,flair airlines,4,very disappointed,very disappointed trying to get home to a family emergency but all three of us have to pay 160 dollars just to change our time whats the point in having insurance if you cant use it for emergencies
21716,vietnam airlines,9,i enjoyed time on board,melbourne to ho chi minh city offered food was not so various even for business class a350 was clean uptodate business seat can turn to flat bed in flight tv provides mostly vietnamese shows movies music with subtitle and some oldschool asianinternational entertainment i enjoyed time on board boarding and landing time thanks to the crew it will always be my prior choice
10753,gulf air,4,missed the connecting flight,ive flown with them on 25 sep 2019 when the plane suffered from technical failure we have to wait on the plane for 2 hours and the gate another 3 hours they provided us with sandwiches and beverages which not enough service on the plane was no problem though we arrived at bahrain 6 hours late thus i have missed the connecting flight at least they gave us a hotel and meals we forced to stay in bahrain for 22 hours they do have a flight to bkk in the morning but didnt relocate the seats to us
17906,shanghai airlines,7,shanghai airlines customer review,bkkpvg had window seat but middle seat unoccupied so i got to stretch out cabin crew spoke little english but were friendly chicken with rice and veggies acceptable economy airline food
21744,vietnam airlines,9,satisfied with the food,this is my third time flying between hanoi and paris with vietnam airlines using premium economy checkin was very fast thanks to sky priority premium economy guests have sky priority benefit during checkin boarding and baggage claim the staff at the counter was really responsible she instructed me all what i need to do as i need to transfer in paris nothing to complain here clearing the border control and security check was slow as the airport was overcrowded and no sky priority this time the seat was very comfortable and convenient even though it could not be made like a flatbed it was enough for me to sleep well legroom was very very generous as this should not be a problem for this class the seat was just 45cm wide a little bit small two meals were served on this 12hour flight i chose to have a seafood meal even though i do not have any problems with any kinds of food in general i was satisfied with both the quantity and the quality of the food the things i love most is the huge diversity of drinks lots of soft drinks juice milk and even wines were offered however extra nonmeal food was bad as stated in the menu instant noodles and sandwiches could be ordered at all time but i failed to order sandwiches as for inflight entertainment since i am vietnamese i really enjoy their programs and i found that vietnam airlines really try their best to put the newest and hottest movies on their entertainment however another issue happened with the headphone the inflight headphones were very old they have been used for quite lots of years also in my seat the headphone could not be strictly plugged into the socket which was really annoying flight attendants are helpful and friendly but i found that they were really tired announcements were well played in three languages vietnamese english and french this time i think that they spoke really well in general i think vietnam airlines managed to satisfy all the requirements for a longhaul flight they also succeeded to make it worth paying extra for premium economy however in order to be 5star they need to improve a lot on the facilities food as well as inflight entertainment
741,air arabia,2,really disappointing service,i had a terrible experience with these guys flight came 4 hours due to medical emergency as they said we understood but they didnt carry none of our luggage whole passengers arrived at destination without luggage it took 3 days to get out luggage that too we were helped by our friends working in abu dhabi airport no air arabia staff showed up or came for help the only response was from call centres we called they were asking to email air arabia but ended up receiving your situation is handled really disappointing service
18440,sky express airlines,8,small propeller planes,siteia to alexandroupoulis small propeller planes with lot of noise during the flight the planes seem old and some seats can be in bad condition the staff is polite they offer a drink cookie caramel and a towel during the flight usually on time better value for money than other regional airlines
7094,china southern airlines,8,attentive crew service,priority boarding service in departure airport flight on time and attentive crew service my little daughter and i got the flight cz8102 from narita to guangzhou on 2 jun the a380 type seat is clean and comfortable we got a great rest warm and polite ground service also keep well
14912,myanmar airways,7,myanmar airways customer review,i have flown myanmar airways several times in the last couple years i have found the service to be fine on the ground and in the air the flight which originates in singapore and flies through bangkok to yangon is exceedingly tight and uncomfortable however flights originating in yangon are comfortable and roomy in general prices are lower than for thai and bangkok air making it a good deal
16121,play,2,customer service was very poor,overall play assistance and customer service was very poor in boston the assistance at the boarding gate was unprofessional play needed to arrive earlier they needed to announce what the expectations more clearly before all the confusion began passengers who did not have a red tag on their personal item and carryon needed to bring them up to the desk then people were charged 90 for bags that they normally can bring on other airlines as a carryon the play personnel kept leaving the desk passenger became anxious and kept cutting in line to be the next person served no orderly process getting a boarding pass on myplay was extremely difficult several people asked us if we had as much trouble as they did the site would need to be accessed several times it finally worked for the trip from boston to keflavik but not visa versa i was confused when it asked if i had a check in bag etc i paid for it already fortunately i was able to go back on the site and confirm my bag status the boarding pass final step didnt provide a pass a popup was shown but i didnt get to read it one person should have been available at the play desk in keflavik we were not even sure it was the service desk until security helped us people want to move on and get through security also at keflavik we took a bus to the airplane the priority people didnt get bused separately so they were just mixed in with the crowd entering the plane again unorganized in general the other parts of the trip were good we left on time and arrived early the plane staffs was good and icelandic staff the checked bags arrived quickly
6868,china airlines,6,always ask you to show the credit card,taipei to san francisco overall experience is fine the worst part is at the checkin counter they always ask you to show the credit card used for purchasing the ticket when i purchased tickets for my kids and they travel alone they almost got stranded at the airport and couldnt get on the flight
2974,air tahiti nui,2,air tahiti nui customer review,on the way to the airport in tahiti flight to la we were told the flight was cancelled becasue the pilots just went on strike no one seemed to know anything my mother who is 89 was ill and needed to get back to the us so i called air tahiti and they said they could get us on air france the next morning and to be at the airport at 430 am which we did we did not have seats on air france as promised and we were told to wait for the air tahiti rep who did not show up until 630 am i told her that air tahiti had promised us seats on air france due to a medical emergency and she said i didnt work yesterday and i cannot help you and slammed the door in my face i knocked on the door and she came out and i got exactly the same response she was so incredibly rude considering we had been sitting on the ground in the airport for 2 hrs luckily we got on stand by to la which was not our final destination we lost all of our connecting flights which delayed medical treatment i would not recommend them to anyone
257,aer lingus,2,pay for drinks on transatlantic flight,worst customer service ever my food was disgusting and had to pay for drinks on transatlantic flight cabin crew were rude to me worst airlines ever
21137,tunisair,4,tunisair customer review,fratunfra pretty worn cabin and cramped seating food okay staff a bit nonchalant and not too serious about their position as hosts but on time and relatively good value for money
20825,transasia airways,9,transasia airways customer review,singapore sin taipei tpe in economy class on a330 343 seating arrangement aircraft brand new and hence no complaints about squeaks dirt or anything seat was ok and comparable to other a330 seats not small but acceptable for large 6ft like me not sure about pitch but i reckon should be 32 and was definitely smaller than sq handrest was a little too low and ive always disliked the slide and recline seats food was not good either fried rice or fried rice noodles for my tpesin leg the snacks provided with the food was good probably because they were selling larger packs of it on their inflight shopping ife was touchscreen with avod but small selection service was ok considering the price paid this was a bargain for fullservice airline
7112,china united airlines,4,no cheaper than normal airlines,dongying to beijing nanyuan lowcost airline a short distance domestic flight basically no service and no meal or drink were served of course no checked in baggage but the thing that its hard to live with is that they only allow you to buy 40kg online prior to checkin which was not enough for me the price of checkin baggage online was fair enough but if you buy that at the checkin counter its another story the ground service staff seems didnt want me to pay for extra baggage and just suggested me to take them to the aircraft when i already have a carryon with me im traveling alone running late and have to insist a few times to pay for my baggage to get my boarding pass nanyuan airport was so problematic that you can hardly find public transport private airport pick up was also likely to be stopped by the security staff after you purchased everything the price is no cheaper than other normal airlines that land in pek if i can find any other option in the same time period i wont choose china united airlines
16567,qatar airways,3,great seats in business class,great seats in business class qsuite and very well mannered crew i would say that onboard services and staff are as good as it gets and ground service and staff are the complete opposite baggage was destroyed on my outbound flight and customer service has been useless in dealing with the issue and made no effort to resolve the issue before my inbound flight the baggage allowance for business class is 40 kilos the fee for extra baggage ranges from 10kilo up to 18kilos depending on the time you purchase it they forgot one of my special diet meals on of my flights providing me with the breakfast on an overnight flight where 2 meals were offered late dinner and breakfast what made things worse was the stewardess trying to convince me that because i ordered the special meal i only get breakfast then the supervisor came over to admit the mistake and apologise overall very disappointed with one of the alleged best airlines in the world service just does not match the level of product they are claiming to provide needless to say i wont be using them again
18410,sky express airlines,5,worst company i have ever traveled,its the worst company i have ever traveled my family and our dog when we were flying to chania it was an hour late and on the way back to athens we were told not to take our little daughters hood from the plane when we picked it up with the suitcases it was broken consider afterwards that it became intentional
16340,qantas airways,5,rang for service three times with no response,service was okay on the first plane but on the a380 it was nonexistent i rang for service three times with no response after an hour l got up and went to the stewards section where two stewards were sitting and ask for a drink the response was a hand appeared from behind the curtain with a drink in the hand and no sorry the food trolley had one steward handing out meals and drinks it took her ages to get to the rear section is this the standard for economy now l am a pensioner and cannot afford premium if i ever fly again l will think twice about qantas or the a380
8809,estonian air,3,estonian air customer review,staff need to go to charm school ok so their natural temperament may be reserved but these people are working in an international setting where they will by definition be meeting customers from many different cultures they should be trained in basic courtesies such as smiling and not looking disdainful when asked for anything
22010,vistara,8,service was excellent and consistent,ive flown this airline in same class before and knew what i can expect happy to notice that airline has hold its standard and imparts superior product among all indian and many eu carriers service excellence catering and safety are few important points i noticed where vistara really plays the ball well on both the sectors service was excellent and consistent as well as catering the entire cabin crew are eager at work and does all they could to serve the best polite courteous warmheart smartly dressed and professional crew reflecting indian culture the catering is among the best do not miss the desserts a catch i noticed is avod should be updated with new movies and series urgently the selection has to be more vivid broader and uptodate after one flight one can easily run out of options while onboard product is excellent where vistara can really improve is ground customer service now for the third time i got differing information in comparison to representatives on airport the ground staff is divided on procedures and info this can be make or break deal because its not reliable cabin crew should keep up the excellent work a superior product does cost a little more but vistara is doing its best and she does reflect her heritage inherited from elder sister in singapore
15865,pegasus airlines,4,no online checkin in english,there is no online checkin website in english mobile application wont download once completed they do not issue or send you the boarding pass automatically but you need to do several other further steps to have it forwarded to your email or phone all in turkish thats incomprehensible flight crew was courteous on the flight to bishkek and the flight was nice
7812,csa czech airlines,2,i did not feel comfortable at all,i booked csa on return journey back from cph to prg used norwegian to get there while the flight was supposed to be operated by airbus 319 upon getting to gate i spotted boeing 737400 rented from go 2 sky slovak charter airline this plane has a history of more than 25 years when it was flying all over the world operated by several unknown airlines too the interior was really old felt like a vintage plane and seat pitch very small when booking a flight safety is one of my priorities and this time i did not feel comfortable at all i was gold ff member of csa for more than 10 years in a row but i am happy that there are other options these days and i do not have to travel with them so frequently anymore
10221,garuda indonesia,6,there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on,overjoyed about the chance to fly ga in their a330900neo dpscgk few days prior to departure however the aircraft is changed into b777300er check in at ga flight business class always done at its class a dedicated check in lounge one concern on flight ga088 to ams was there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on what i found worse was when the cabin crews walked past those passengers and did not notice and did not give any warning once i thought perhaps those passengers just forgot to have their mask on but no afterwards i went to the incharge crews in business class with an angry voice to address my concern as to why they let such things happen in corona times although all ga cabin crews are vaccinated against covid19 they must have been more alert with the onboard situation like on any other airlines i have flown with it makes me wonder is it the lack of english of the crews or just an ignorance i have written a few good reviews about ga flights but not this time they announced that all passengers must sit according to seat number on the boarding pass but this is yet another issue i had to sit in one seat far away from my travel companion because of the social distancing but when one asked to move seat to the empty seat between us it was allowed by the crew ife on ga flights are still below average kindly do an upgrade a pillow on board would have helped my quality of sleep
10440,germanwings,9,germanwings customer review,we have just returned from cologne to manchester using germanwings we were very impressed we have frequently used other cheap airlines and if you want more pay more you can check in on line 72 hours before travelling and can select seats free of charge the only criticism is that you cant check in for return at the same time as you can with other airlines that means unless you have access to a printer while away you are assigned seats at the airport for the return journey
15339,olympic air,5,queue for checkin delayed flight,rhodes to athens delayed by 42 mins very sad to see the delays in olympic air flights queue for checkin delayed flight barely any checking of my covid vaccination status for domestic flight no parking at jetway gates no air conditioning in airport buses in 40 degrees the cabin is still operated very well and the flight attendants are very helpful
5389,bangkok airways,5,lack of convenient flights,bangkok to phnom penh availability of lounge is good most areas inside the plane not clean we took off from the terminal instead of the usual ferrying out to the tarmac by bus i use them because lack of convenient flights but would change if viable options this boutique airline looking old and shabby compared to newer planes
5541,belavia,7,airline is simple but it works,flew belavia from kiev to moscow via minsk i read a review saying that they wanted to charge 200 dollars if you dont have the boarding pass and made sure i had mine but then at the airport they even printed a new one and said the boarding pass was free i cant be sure its always like that but that is what they told me ryanair would not print you a new boarding pass so i guess boarding pass is free the airline is simple but it works its better than extreme low cost like ryanair in my opinion luggage is included etc 2 flights for 93 euros and this service seems good to me
21942,virgin australia,5,doesnt really do what it promises,when you pay double economy and are promised a premium experience virgin doesnt really do what it promises check in line was long with none travelling business class it was so slow that i went to economy as it was faster no premium through security only one gate agent so it was confusing that premium had to basically cut the line on board was lovely nice staff full meal i had a poke bowl but the mainland pre packaged cheese crackers cheapened it surely a bread roll is nicer plus there was nothing sweet a mini kit kat would have sufficed luggage was the most disappointing as it took nearly an hour to arrive longer than the actual flight five flights were sharing the same luggage belt i think they need to lift their game to ensure they deliver the premium experience they promise
12788,kenya airways,9,a customer friendly choice,this was my first flight on kenya airways i was impressed with the service cleanliness and punctuality at the airport as well as on flight i would highly recommend the airline as a customer friendly choice
21831,virgin america,4,i was very disappointed,this virgin america flight experience is not the one i have grown accustomed to unlike other flights the crew made excuses for everything some people waited over two hours for their beverages and or food the service was not well orchestrated and the attendants were grumpy the bathrooms looked trashy after about the 12 way point with trash on the floor and countertops trash can was full as well the seat back consoles did not work there was one attempt to reboot them and that got the network going but not the tv the new netflix access was up and down the entire flight the flight was normal and no complaints on departure or smoothness of ride but for a cross country flight you need more than that i have flown this route on this airline many times and was very disappointed in my goto airline might have to try jet blue next time
8171,druk air,7,druk air customer review,bangkokparo via kolkata business class excellent attentive service the extra few dollars for business is well worth it given the enormous difference in comfort and service incredible mountain views on this flight
6571,cathay dragon,4,high priced budget airline,hong kong to changsha return outward flight left on time and arrived slightly early plane was very clean snack was to say the least minimal pack of 4 cookies bottle of water small chocolate i had to ask for coffee for a 4000hkd ticket i would have expected more return leg we all boarded early and could have left early however we sat for 45 minutes before an announcement was made of a technical issue it was sorted but left 30 mins late and was late into hong kong more info could have been given and we all could have stayed in the terminal food identical the airline is not cathay it is still a high priced budget airline no in flight entertainment unless you have already downloaded the app

4973,avianca,2,sub charges for carry on luggage,this is a terrible company to fly with when you purchase a ticket you are no advise to upgrade anything but you get hit with sub charges for carry on luggage i would not use this company avianca for any reason any longer
6029,british airways,9,another great experience,another really great pair of flights on time no problems at all champagne was ok and my meal choices were great the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat in flight entertainment could have been better cant wait to fly with ba again and enjoy another great experience
18722,south african airways,7,the food was great,i flew with south african airways on the 13 january 2017 from perth to johannesburg the staff looked smart and they were friendly the seats looked old and dirty but had decent legroom the food was great the ife wasnt too good the headphones were very tight and the one side wasnt working
15891,penair,1,terrible customer service,dutch harbor to anchorage if i could give penair a negative star rating i would and i think that would be being generous i have flown penair at least 30 times i live in rural alaska and they are the only carrier that services our community so that explains why i have had to use their services absolutely terrible customer service from almost everyone i have dealt with at penair lets start with bags rarely do your bags travel on the same plane as you do even though they promise they will also when your bags do finally arrive they will not deliver them to you you will have to take time off work and go pick them up at the airport happen to me at least 20 times gate agents the ones in anchorage are rude and do not care the staff in dutch tries and are nicer but are inept equipment older planes that tend to have mechanical issues which cause delays and cancellations not good air travel does not get much worse that with penair
20489,thomson airways,5,recommend the airline,we flew with thomson from manchester to reus salou in october 2015 check in was quick and smooth security at manchester airport was very busy considering it was about 4am when i found out that it was a b757200 i was not impressed boarding was very unimpressive and needs to be taken care of aircraft was full on the way out legroom was dreadful seats werent too bad a bit uncomfortable staff were probably the best thing about the flights return flight check in at reus airport was the exact opposite of manchester while the security issue was the same took us about 90 mins to get through check in and security the aircraft was slightly more comfortable and less noisy the seat looked a bit newer and the legroom felt as if it was better very quick arrival at manchester and into arrivals within 10 minutes they even let me have a cockpit visit at the end of our return flight despite all of the bad stuff i would still recommend the airline
20012,thai airways,5,disappointing for the money we paid,went from singapore to bangkok airbus a350 then on from bangkok to london heathrow boeing 777 positives received 3 meals over 2 flights and all the food was delicious especially the rice this was as a surprise as didnt have high expectations for their food however their was a vegan passenger next to me who was only served fruit the whole flight negatives the seat was uncomfortable and hard with no leg rest but can recline the chair the cabin crew were no longer in their traditional thai outfits they were not that friendly but were present throughout the flight the ground staff at bangkok were not up to the land of smiles name and the crews seemed to lack friendliness although they remained professional and efficient didnt use wifi on both flights so cannot comment on their connectivity cannot comment also on the in flight entertainment but no doubt there would have been choice will fly with them again if you get a cheap deal but overall average disappointing for the money we paid
6499,caribbean airlines,5,caribbean airlines customer review,portofspain miami return service at piarco atrocious and sloppy in the early morning people should be vibrant and happy not sloppy and rude which was the case flight attendants nice and hot meals on both legs ife started with caribbean essence with no audio then all screens went blank for the rest of the trip no one even bothered to explain the technical difficulty on return meal was mashed potatoes and bbq chicken with the amount of gravy in the meal it turned out to be a soup ife audio and video were not working properly so it was difficult to understand the movie again no explanation to even apologize for the inconvenience clean planes with comfortable seating i am only using this airline because american airlines is no better
3555,airbaltic,8,quite a nice experience,palanga to saint petersburg via riga quite a nice experience air baltic provides an awesome connectivity around the baltic states and beyond check in boarding staff choice of planes is quite a pleasure specially the a220 huge windows great seat pitch mood lighting etc etc the only downside is pricing its certainly not cheap specially if you need to add check in luggage meals seat selection or overweight hand luggage
8223,eastern airways,9,eastern airways customer review,newcastlebirmingham flew out and back on a saab 41 turbo prop with 29 seats there was surprisingly a lot of leg room which was welcome one member of cabin crew was very efficient and the captain kept us up to date when we encountered a 20 min delay on the short flight we were served complimentary drinks and snacks very good professional airline
7775,csa czech airlines,1,first flight late,milan malpensa to birmingham via prague first flight late from milan to prague second flight late from prague to birmingham lost my luggage something more yes after 5 days i still dont have my luggage
2652,air nostrum,6,expect better from air nostrum,alicante to madrid uncoordinated ground staff who left 2 wheelchair users waiting without communication for over 30 minutes in a communal area checkin was laborious with one staff member conducting personal conversation rather than processing her passengers boarding was slow very slow indeed two wheelchair users were left in a hot area without communication and were then boarded first this was no problem other than other passengers being required to descend narrow stairs and wait for a bus the bus was very full and needed to make 2 journeys passengers were allowed to carry with them far too much luggage and this proved to be problematic in the extreme following departure the staff were poorly coordinated and communication was poor arrival was prompt but a bus was needed to negotiate a very large madrid airport clearly much needs to be done to improve matters one would expect better from air nostrum
21047,tuifly,3,tuifly customer review,tuifly has been converted into a lowcostairline by may 2014 only 15kg of baggage are allowed and no inflight service is provided the flight from crete to germany was ontime but it seemed the aircraft cleaners did a very poor job booked with a packagetour this product is unacceptable unfortunately the rating system requires at least one star even for not provided services foodbeverages and inflight entertainment
15252,norwegian,1,i found the process confusing,oakland to oslo in october 2019 the flight was booked for a price of 80351 round trip total for myself and my companion for each leg we were provided an opportunity to bid for an upgrade for each leg i intended to bid 10 additional about 40 in each case but i found the process confusing i was shocked to find that i was billed a total of 183450 for the trip which is a 128 increase in the fare as opposed to my intended 10 increase i contacted norwegian air and was refused any adjustment in the end this confusing upgrade process and refusal to provide a reasonable settlement appears to be a corporate strategy to enhance the bottom line with no regard for customer satisfaction
4353,ana all nippon airways,9,great service lovely crew,great service lovely crew comfortable seats lots of leg room i am 62 roomy toilets and an immaculately clean aircraft its hard to imagine how a 14 hour flight in economy could be done any better i paid in advance an extra 15 for a special japanese meal which was most definitely worth it and really delicious beautifully presented
22288,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,one wonders how an airline like this can offer free food and drink in such a short period of time have a charming crew clean planes and easy check in and boarding flew hamburg to rotterdam couldnt recommend it highly enough

15329,okay airways,4,okay airways customer review,second trip with okay airways this time from dalian to yantai in a ma60 a chinese turboprop that seats about 50 passengers with 22 abreast seating flight takes only about 40 minutes in the air price was pretty reasonable given the length of the flight and that flying a chinesemade aircraft means no taxes seats bit cramped i had to stretch my legs in the aisle no screens of any kind just magazines in the seat pocket acceptable for a regional flight but that does not mean that there should be chewing gum gluing the pages together nothing to eat or drink no bottled water no bags of nuts the only flight attendant was invisible through out the flight arrived on time overall not a pleasant experience
3628,aircalin,3,a shame of airline,a shame of airline they have lost my luggage same for 2 more colleagues in august and i am still waiting for a refund 21052023 they dont answer my mails and i had to pay to a lawyer to try to solve this issue for me the worst company ever
484,aerolineas argentinas,7,aerolineas argentinas customer review,flew on oct 21st from ezeiza to miami on ar 1304 equipment was airbus 330200 traveled in business class seat 5d check in service was very friendly and efficient business class lounge was spacious and comfortable and serviced by attentive staff boarding was very good and through a separate jet way from other cabin welcome on board was very friendly and helpful seats are flat but at an angle very uncomfortable and i kept on sliding downwards inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video unfortunately the only wc in business class was out of order so we had to use filthy economy class lavatories not good
13695,level,2,without free food or water,i am a seasoned traveler and have never crossed the atlantic without free food or water being offered a full plane from boston to barcelona and not a sip of water offered when a passenger in front of me asked why he had not been offered a beverage the flight attendant told him he must have been asleep i was awake and they moved right past me too the worst cabin service ever never fly this airline again
11305,icelandair,2,they do not offer dairy free meals,i have a big complaint they do not offer dairy free meals im flying saga class on an international airline and youd think they would offer something for people who are made sick by dairy they do not they only offer lactose reduced which means the food will have casein and whey so right now im very angry with them when i called before i left portland the woman on the phone told me that if only id called 48 rather than 24 hours previous id have had a meal so this time i just called three days ahead and no such dairy free meal exists business class unbelievable and the comfort level of the seating was far below american united and british airways i was a fool not to read all the skytrax reviews first next time ill know better
7733,croatia airlines,9,croatia airlines customer review,athzagspu return first section an a319 in good condition clean with pre assigned seats the domestic section with q400 i do not like that plane i think it is uncomfortable for the passengers with tiny toilet the service is excellent special meal tasteful with beverage or winebear newspapers no english stewards were very friendly and eager to serve you on time boarding on the planes but delays on departures sometimes due to controllers sometimes due to transferring passengers
11832,japan airlines,1,all my expectations were overly met,this review is based on my own flying experience i have never travelled internationally japan airlines 7878 dreamliner flight number 746 was the first international flight i had this airline as a whole is superb i almost forgot that we are flying thousands of feet above air because of the warm welcome and support by japan airlines 746 cabin crew on board we are in a pandemic but even though the cabin crew were covered with face masks it didnt hinder them in showcasing the real smiles of how we are welcomed and accommodated on board i worked in customer service for over a decade now and this jal cabin crew delivered an exceptional support and service thank you jal flight 746 for your best among the rest support and service dont worry about your ticket i had the lowest economy ticket but as a customer all my expectations were overly met
13331,lan airlines,5,lan airlines customer review,flew on la801 from scl to syd on 2615 on the outside lans 7879 is a beautiful aircraft on the inside though it is too cramped for a long haul service the 3x4x3 configuration is reasonable however the seats are too close together pax taller than 18 metres and longer legs suffer all the way larger pax also do not fit in the narrow seats comfortably for dinner in the absence of a vegetarian option i was offered ravioli with nothing inside and very little tomato sauce for breakfast a cold ham and cheese sandwich accompanied by a cup of cold coffee no cheese only sandwich a suitable vegetarian option was also not available someone spent so much money on the latest aircraft and forgot to put together a decent menu to feed its cramped passengers whats the story with spanish speaking south american crews no humour i thought this was isolated to aerolineas argentinas but lans crew suffers from the same thing flying emirates next time
17186,rwandair,2,worst ever flight,cape town to tel aviv via kigali worst ever flight first and last time with rwanda air delays of 2 6 hours unexplained no customer care at that delay time broke luggage thoroughly broken and missing parts old plane broken seatno entertainment beside a pakistani movie in a loop food is an insult for airline food staff is friendly but need lots of training never again

18690,south african airways,3,not a pleasant experience,johannesburg to hong kong i am not having a pleasant experience due to this flight sa286 boarding was on time but then with all passengers on board flight was delayed by almost an hour with sketchy explanations from the cabin crew to start eventually after simmering in the plane for too long the pilot tells us that the reason why we havent taken off is because it is too hot needs to be 27 to fly and it was still 28 if it was too hot then i feel it is inhumane to load us in and make us wait in the sweltering plane for an hour before taking us on our 12 hour flight surely they could have explained that upfront and adjusted the boarding time accordingly then the inflight entertainment system was faulty but luckily after 2 restarts equating to over another hour it worked alright again for the rest of the trip there is no cellphone charging for economy class i thought that was standard these days particularly if there was going to be the threat of no inflight entertainment in the morning one toilet sink was overflowing approaching hong kong they had to apologise for the lack of arrival cards for passengers due to the delay i have missed my connecting flight which was supposed to be at 2pm and can only go at 545pm now
16669,regent airways,7,overall value for money,dhaka to singapore with regent airways the checkin was smooth at dhaka better than my other checkin experiences at dhaka the aircraft was a boeing 737700 which showed signs of aging the interior needs refurbishment the meal could have been better the cabin crew was quite helpful and nice there is no ife in the cabin and difficult to kill time overall value for money
17877,shanghai airlines,5,shanghai airlines customer review,flight fm846 29 dec hong kong to shanghai flight left 40 minutes late paid quite a bit extra and given it was only 8 seats you would expect reasonable service and have a bit of peace and quiet but it seems that if you are in economy you just use any toilet this was business class you pay the extra for the trimmings and expect a higher level of service and cabin separation normally because you have paid more you get a mini bus for business class passengers but there were none will be wary of code share flights from now on
5482,batik air,7,flight attendant are nice,surabaya to makassar finally a flight for home and i choose this airline great ground staff clean cabin the flight attendant are nice crowded flight great take off and good landing no delay

15790,pegasus airlines,3,my experience was beyond awful,pegasus is a budget airline its main objective is to transport people at the lowest cost possible they do so by removing unnecessary services such as onboard meals and so on no one expects luxury treatment when flying with pegasus the last time i flew with pegasus my experience was beyond awful during checkin i asked an airline representative to check my carryon bag and put it in the luggage compartment instead of the cabin usually airlines dont charge you for this sometimes they even ask you to do it when the flight is full pegasus told me this wasnt allowed but i could pay 50usd for extra baggage allowance and in that case they would be able to check my carryon i agreed upon arrival to my final destination i discovered that a few items were stolen the total amount of damage was insignificant i reported this incident to the airline but they refused to compensate the damage saying pegasuss liability is limited and pegasus accepts no responsibility for any liability over the applicable liability limits in accordance with legal regulations
14902,myanmar airways,7,myanmar airways customer review,bkkrgn all economy flight short connection from our late arriving ek flight from dxb was made easier by a meet and greet at the arrival gate to the transit mai check in easy boarding for a 60 full flight changed seat row after takeoff fairly elderly a 319 showing its age light snack and drink on the short 1 hour flight to our surprise all our luggage made the short transfer and arrived after bhxdxbbkkrgn first on the carousel

8298,easyjet,4,easyjet dont care,nothing wrong with the flight but rather than arrive at gatwick north we arrived at gatwick south no announcement from the crew or anyone so there were passengers left confused late at night in the wrong terminal with their connections greeters and onward arrangements screwed up a simple announcement or warning by the crew would have helped but easyjet dont care and their pricing is despicable
18815,southwest airlines,3,inability to have flight crews ready,faa delay today is understandable for delays however once flights are active again and we are delayed for an additional hour here hour there due to southwests inability to have flight crews ready once faa problem was resolved you can only blame faa for the morning delays not the lack of preparedness by your company
22681,wings air,3,very rude to all passengers,i was flying with my two little kids although according to boarding pass boarding should have started at 0950 the crew announced the final call at 0938 when we asked why the rush they screamed at us if we want to fly we should get info the plne right now no service at all by ground crew and very rude to all passengers

19198,sun country airlines,6,i recommend this airline,amazing airline but some things to work on the carry on bag size is too small and the price to buy an over head luggage is to expensive its a perfectly fine airline except for that i recommend this airline if you are going for no longer than 3 days if not i recommend delta they had amazing service and that experience was amazing
21417,ural airlines,3,no announcement on any delay,moscow to simferopol with ural airlines flight was at 1700 till 1700 no announcement on any delay no representative of airline available for information the hotline of call center does not answer the airport airline office does not answer

563,aeromexico,6,airline seems to be giving up,club premier seating it dated food in business class was limited to a sandwich nuts thankfully drinks are included thats with any other reasonable airline airline seems to be giving up its sad
17782,scoot,4,endured a very uncomfortable flight,due to severe reduction of flights from singapore to hong kong because of covid19 i could not choose to fly with my favourite singapore airlines all their afternoon flights have been cut i was left with the only reasonably priced option scoot for today mar 12th their 787 was deployed and i was rather curious and looked forward to trying it i had problems with check in at their computer kiosk was directed to the assistance counter to complete my check in the lady was not friendly nor very helpful never mind hopefully the flight experience will make up for it for today no meals or duty free will be available to purchase instead each passenger was given a bottle of water and a packaged croissant i was sat the the so called quiet zone load factor was very low they still insisted to sit a lady in our seat of 3 where she could have any other seats all 3 to herself not her fault but the airlines the thing to do would be to move to another empty to give her more room and myself i was not allowed to i was told due to the virus situation passengers must not move to any seats for tracing purpose later if necessary as a result all 3 of us squeezed onto 6 de and f endured a very uncomfortable flight inside a 30 full cabin thanks to the cunning arrangement of the check in agent i had to take scoot because i had no other choice and they did not show me that flying with them had any benefits besides the low price 787 usually is very nice plane but when it becomes a scoot plane it looked cheap and tattered everywhere with very tight seat pitch cabin crew were so so doing the bare minimum i dread to think how people endure long haul trips withe them from singapore to athens and berlin in that same aircraft
22886,wow air,9,wasnt bad at all,toronto to paris cdg via keflavik i flew yesterday and it wasnt a bad flight i had no issues theyre a lowcost airline you get what you expect and what you paid for our flight wasnt late the flight attendants were friendly the pilots were friendly we took a photo with them for my daughters first flight it wasnt bad at all
1625,air europa,4,would not recommend the airline,the flight itself was okay regarding plane and onboard entertainment as well as punctuality however leg room is very little and the on board service is an very disappointing for an 11hr flight everything extra except for one meal no choice and water flight attendants also are not necessarily very nice ground service is the worst i have seen you are randomly assigned a seat even if you fly as a couple that booked together there is no way to change this online checkin in advance was not possible would not recommend the airline again their advantage however is clearly the price
16243,porter airlines,2,completely unprofessional,worst airline company and customer service ever completely not professional hated my experience and would not recommend it so much sub par to the performance of other airlines i experienced the communication nor the comfort is very amateurish got my flight cancelled and nobody communicated any plans and the rebooking was done on a flight the day after when spots were open on flights the same day but apparently i had to pay an extra to be rebooked on the same day completely unprofessional
21103,tunisair,3,cabin crew not friendly,istanbul to tunis with tunisair the checkin and boarding process at istanbul airport was efficient the cabin crew were not friendly and lacked courtesy the catering is average and only 1 choice of meal i will only fly again with tunisair if there is no other option
8869,ethiopian airlines,1,sleeping on the jump seats,on my first flight from dxb to addis there was a delay due to the weather conditions in addis while this delay is beyond ethiopian airlines control unfortunately there was no prior information given to passengers in dubai despite a delay of 6 hours the more severe issue was that inflight when i went to the bathroom at the rear of the aircraft there were two flight attendants sleeping on the jump seats in the galley

1319,air canada rouge,4,i felt like a sardine,toronto to barcelona these planes are way too tight for long haul flights i felt like a sardine a friend paid extra for her seat and was very uncomfortable the first class seats are a joke for all the extra room they have our return trip from rome was longer but seemed shorter in a regular air canada plane the seats were comfortable with more leg room and monitors on the seat backs no extra cost paid for seats

10790,hainan airlines,6,very disappointing experience,singapore to haikou on 15 december no selection of seats available online i called the hotline in china and was advised that i can do so upon checkin at singapore check in i wasnt able to select my seat and was allocated an aisle seat at the second last row of the plane very near the 2 toilets we were given two food choices and i found both horrible tasteless chicken breast macaroni and spinach or meat sauce noodles with assorted dim sum and vegetable no in flight entertainment or seat power socket leg room was decent but my seat wasnt very comfortable no in flight magazine at my seat flight attendants were polite but seemed overworked overall i would rather pay to get better seats and better food on lccs than what hainan airlines offered me very disappointing experience

4779,austrian airlines,5,kicked around our baggage,heraklion to vienna on 1st july after arrival we had to wait 5min in the cabin and watch through the window how 2 airport workers threw and kicked around our baggage without reason i phoned the call center and they told me this is not allowed i am furious i was not able to tell it to them face to face and ask them if they would like it if someone threw their stuff around like that our baggage has been damaged and we have to fill in a form but this wont solve the issue flight was good but this was not okay
9273,fastjet,1,really disappointed with fastjet,im really dissapointed with fastjet for our honeymoon my husband and i booked a short trip from johannesburg to zanzibar from 1823 of november were both very busy so we cannot take more days off or travel on other days we booked this months in advance then last week i got the email from fastjet announcing that our return ticket has been changed from the 23 to the 20 november at this point i was already very much disappointed because we only had a 2day honeymoon and if i wanted to go away for just the weekend i would have stayed in sa but fastjet said it was the only option and by now other tickets were already much more expensive so we couldnt afford anything else this weekend i got another email saying the flight had been changed again we would now depart on the 27 november 1 week later and there was not even a return ticket this was just impossible for us so we were forced to cancel the trip unfortunately because of such a late notice from fastjet we cannot cancel the hotel reservations in zanzibar anymore customer service declined my request for a refund of the money which honestly is not even close to compensating the disappointment of not having the honeymoon we so much looked forward to
16056,phuket air,4,phuket air customer review,lgw to bangkok out 24205 back 10305 i had been dreading it maybe we were just lucky the planes are a bit old and tatty but no worse than others ive flown in our case the exklm both ways we were in economy and legroom and seat width was ok both flights were around half full so we had a row of 3 between the 2 of us makes a world of difference service was excellent food better than average drinks available although on request because the cabin crew dont hassle you much managed to get some kip on the way home which for me is unusual both flights were on time and devoid of trauma yes the plane stopped at sharjah for about an hour and the toilets were cleaned and checked which took about 20 minutes
3750,akasa air,1,multiple flights and always delayed,do not recommend have been multiple flights with this airline and always delayed do not have sufficient flights to operate causing delays also seats are uncomfortable mostly getting booked due to low prices but go for indigo
19680,tam airlines,7,satisfied with the service provided,toronto to new york with tam airlines and overall satisfied with the service provided i used tam given their competitive price baggage allowance and reluctance to use air canada the flights were on time 1 hour flight time each way comfortable seating in economy with a small snack service impressed with the cleanliness of the cabin and newness of aircraft speedy delivery of luggage at both airports one thing i did not understand is why they wait so long to depart when everyone is seated and cargo hold closed the cabin was a bit on the cool side as several people put on their jacket i plan to use them again for my subsequent nyc trips
1752,air france,9,this airline is really improving,excellent flight from paris to montral i wouldnt have recommended air france 6 or 7 years ago but this airline is really improving the cabin crew was pleasing and careful the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class the only negative point is that paris cdg is really disorganized it is probably one of the worst airports ive had experienced with amsterdam ams in europe i really hope that it will improve within the next years
23015,xl airways france,6,it was better than i was expecting,punta cana to paris i was sceptical of this airline having read the reviews but there was a limited choice when booking airlines overall it was better than i was expecting the plane was tidy although showing its age a bit good news was there was power at the seat bad the seats are not very comfortable especially for a long haul flight ok for a day flight but not for a night flight there is a wifi entertainment system where you can watch entertainment see info about destinations which does not have any use due to the limited information and flight tracking of course there is an upgraded option available for 10 eur food was very average drink options good but have to pay free tea coffee and water the later being freely available and the cabin crew visited the cabin regularly to top up be aware the checkin ques were bad so give yourself plenty of time also carry on luggage has a max weight of 5kg with it being checked a lot of the time
13279,lan airlines,6,it was disappointing,santiago to sydney via auckland with latam airlines for now the largest airline in south america lan merged with tam to form latam it was disappointing from perspectives of cabin crew service attitude crew presence meal service and choice of liquors on particularly the longest leg 13 hrs sclakl aklsyd leg was slightly better crew the service crew behaviour was cold the cabin staff disappeared in the pantry for almost 20 minutes there was no premeal drinks service unless requested although biz class was only 70 full they seemed peeved by anyone ordering the standard full meal and breakfast vs an express option the main of veal and semolina arrived cold only a choice of one of each of whiskey rum vodka but the choice of argentinian or chilean wine was better noteworthy that it is one of the airlines longest routes on a b787 twinengine over the south pacific
11611,iran air,5,iran air customer review,ir 232 thrsyz when we reached the national airport at tehran our flight was 2 hours delayed without any further information so had 2 hours before we could checkin entering an older fokker 100 we were warmly welcomed by the crew after takeoff we got a lunch box containing a sandwich with turkey some sweets and water afterwards they served also other soft drinks staff was always very friendly so the flight was good only the delay was not so good
5000,avianca,1,really low cost airline,this is the second time that i experience a very long delay and airport staff does not seem to care since they are used to this this is the last time that i am using avianca thankfully i managed to change my return with a different airline avianca is now functioning as a really low cost airline charging prices as if they were a premium one it is shameful and i hope soon enough they close it down or sell it to a company that will manage it properly
23134,zipair,2,i will be picking another airline next time,the seats on the plane were uncomfortable no entertainment no free water or drinks or snacks everything has to be purchased prior to take off or during flight for snacks and drinks there was no ac that i could feel hot and uncomfortable staff members pick and choose to tell people to put your seatbelt on but will bypass some maybe they feel uncomfortable to ask it took a long time to check in i will be picking another airline next time
3358,airasia philippines,3,changes every minute,our flight was smooth at first we enjoyed our trip from manila to cebu but during our return to manila our flight was delayed from 5pm to 550pm then to 720pm to 710 pm to 725 pm and lastly to 750pm due to these changes every minute we have been confused and were not able to go to the gate 20mins before the final time of departure we arrived 6 mins late and were not accepted on the gate our flight was forfeited and we need to book another flight to be able to return to manila it was so devastating and heartbreaking as we have to incur another expense to return to manila that costs us same price of round trip from manila to cebu and vice versa
22392,volaris,1,the people were incredibly rude,i found out when i went to get my boarding pass they overbooked the flight and i no longer could get anything until 2 days later the people were incredibly rude and the supervisor literally left and started helping people for 40 min when he was supposed to be doing something for us compensations i was offered was 8 for food 100 credit no way im using them again i called later and was hung up by customer service twice i think that sums up the absolute embarrassment of a company this is and they should be ashamed of the people they hire the 2 supervisors i talked to were the worst of them all

14801,monarch airlines,3,wouldnt wish to fly them again,400 am at london gatwick south isnt my preferred time for checkingin to a scheduled flight to dalaman sadly a later flight with ba had been cancelled because of insufficient demand so monarch airlines it had to be in fact checkin and security was quick and painless and even the no 1 lounge was just about okay the onboard experience was average to irritating because of a crying child a few rows behind the borderline moronic people behind us getting fueled up with champagne and beer at a ridiculous time of the day and monarchs insistence on trying to persuade passengers to their rubbishy snacks and limited hot food options still the plane landed moreorless on time and our luggage eventually turned up on the carousel flying with monarch wasnt as dispiriting as say ryanair but we certainly wouldnt wish to fly with them again

460,aerolineas argentinas,4,you get a disapproving reply,flew buenos aires aeroparque to santiago de chile with aerolineas argentinas to use up some of my air france miles tried to checkin for my flight from buenos aires on their web site which didnt work probably because my reservation code was that of air france and not aerolineas argentinas when calling aerolineas argentinas in order to find out the reservation code i should use for making the checkin online after a very long wait i ended up talking with the most rude agent ive ever encountered according to her i should have never called ar for this matter since i hadnt used them for my initial booking furthermore she accused me several times during the call for interrupting her when i simply tried to explain to her that all i wanted to know was the reservation code that they must have for my reservation in their system she kept on repeating that she does not work for air france and eventually she just hang up so far so good for skyteam worried about what may be next i arrived at the airport two hours before departure to find a nearly empty checkin line so far so good boarding took place relatively easily bearing in mind were in argentina although by a single bus for a full b737 once airborne a sandwich box and coffeesoft drinks were offered but of course one shouldnt ask for beer or wine despite being a country producing so many great wines as all you get is a disapproving reply from the cabin crew stating that they dont serve them on regional flights well if their region extends to flights over two hours i wonder who made up that policy at least landed in time in santiagio
9537,firefly,7,firefly customer review,flew kuasin short flight competently managed we were charged heavily for overweight baggage 20 kg over for two people the fee was as much as one ticket check in staff and flight crew were friendly and helpful the atr turboprop used was as comfortable as expected but this 185 cm passenger asked for the exit row row 1 after boarding
15644,openskies,2,will not be traveling openskies again,paris ory to new york jfk with openskies i utilized my american airlines frequent flyer miles and i will not waste them on this airline again the seat configuration was so bizarre i had a window seat and i had to climb over the seat next to me to get into the aisle as it was configured in the opposite direction from mine one expects business class to have a seat that lies down flat after all thats why i chose to fly this class on a flight over the atlantic it was not in the least bit comfortable and i cant imagine who thought it would be going forward i will not be traveling openskies again

6263,bulgaria air,9,another good experience,bulgaria air is definitely the best choice to fly from sofia to milan and back brand new aircraft and good service arrived at the airport 1h30min before the flight and went straight to the business class check in desk as a silver member security was very fast this time the boarding was organised it was a full flight i was able to change my seat to an extra legroom seat in row 3 up to 25 times more legroom than economy and it costs 20 more each way i would say that these extra legroom seats are better than any intra european business class we took off on time snacks were given to all passengers a small sandwich drinks and a chocolate we landed in sofia on time i would say that i had another good experience with bulgaria air
15949,philippine airlines,1,check in and give my passport three times,at first when you check in your bag its the same thing as other airport you check the bag you check in and then you grab your boarding pass nothing bad so far then upon checking your bags in youll then go through immigration where they will once again do another inspection and in line there will be one guy in a little podium with a sign that says secondary inspection in the span of what seemed like less than 30 minutes ive already had to check in and give my passport three times when going to our gate there was another check in just to get to our waiting area but it gets worse once we waited through that line we thought this would be a good time to grab some snacks and drinks to wait for our plane but little did we know that not only are you required to check in again to come back to the waiting area but no foods or drinks were allowed in the waiting area i looked around to see signs and didnt find a single one about not allowing food so here we are now with purchases food unable to go back to our bags and forced to eat outside our solution for this was taking turns someone would go and watch our bags while the others ate outside it would be very nice if the bathrooms were located inside our waiting area her mother had to leave the waiting area use the bathroom and then check back in to come back to us
4778,austrian airlines,1,not recommend them at all,the worst ever experience in 40 years of flying dysfunctional and extremely incompetent try to email write to them all your efforts fall on deaf ears they are not interested to listen flight after flight were cancelled without reasonable explanation austrian airlines ruined our much awaited two weeks holiday to reunite with our family not recommend them at all put in a cheap hotel when the connection flight was cancelled as well due to unexplained reasons
10431,germanwings,3,germanwings customer review,cgn to fao cologne to faro on an a320 outbound flight a little late due to late arrival of aircraft flight was on a jetway but passengers had to use the stairs crew were nice and flight was full same on return flight from faro i had a smart price ticket so you should sit in row 4 to 14 with more legroom onward flight i was seated row 15 return row 23 as miles and more member in my profile they knew that i needed a lactose free meal but you only get a snack box cheese sandwichroll or chickensalami sandwichroll but both are not with buttermargarine they all contain cream cheese as basic spread so i was not able to eat that when the crew came around i was entitled to only one soft drink you have to pay for wine or a beer spirits not available at all since both flights were full and only 3 crew members were on board it was a hard job for them they have less toilets compared to the old lh planes so we had only 2 toilets for almost 150 passengers on the return flight one wc was not serviceable
1789,air india,7,this was a welcome flight,i took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate the online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger a321 for this sector i had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see also surprisingly on this flight sector i had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich i had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good landing and arrival into blr was also well ahead of time however when the time came to collect the baggage i had noticed that again the new bag tag which i had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that i had just purchased recently and put even last week when i travelled from kolkata to mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off so it seems that air india is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into but other than that this was a welcome flight and i am hoping that the next time i travel they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give
17496,sata air azores,6,was pleasantly surprised,wasnt feeling very confident flying with the airline due to the reviews but was pleasantly surprised crew was professional and courteous food on both legs was surprisingly good and there were several options for drinks really short transfer at pdl which went by seamlessly however the seats are not very comfortable and the wifi connectivity only provides you with access to their ife portal which has a limited but decent quality selection considering this is a relative small airline based in an archipelago in the middle of the ocean i appreciate the fact that its not a no frills experience would definitely fly with them again as someone who really wants to visit the azores
19836,tap portugal,2,scammed into paying 250 for luggage fees,we were scammed into paying 250 for luggage fees we got to the airport 3 hours early and were not able to get into the gate until 10 minutes before boarding time because it was blocked off by a partition once they let the line of people into the gate area we were told we would have to pay 250 for our carryons because they were heavier than 10kg even though we paid online to check a bag in advance but the agent told us we would have to check the bag downstairs and since the flight was about to leave we didnt have time to check our bags so we had to pay we also hardly received any water while on the flight my wife is pregnant and had to ask the flight attendant multiple times on the 12 hour flight just for a glass of water
3281,airasia india,3,made me pay more for luggage,chandigarh to delhi worst experience ever made me pay more for luggage than i did for the flight also flight was late and nobody from the staff was at the gate to answer any questions not traveling from this ever again

144,aegean airlines,6,meal was good for a 90 min flight,athens to beirut on an a321 business class seat is the same as in economy hard and rather uncomfortable meal was good for a 90 min flight both in quality and quantity though i find the pasta with chicken combination weird no champagne available only sparkling wine but good offer of beverages and greek liquors crew young wellgroomed with some members being somehow snobbish no wifi and no entertainment will not fly again such a product in business on the other side the brand new aegean business class at athens airport for extraschenghen flights is quite impressive in terms of decor ambiance and food drinks selection well done aegean
16613,qatar airways,7,water has to be requested,it was a very long flight from sydney to doha cabin crew were very attentive and professional as the flight was only during the night and everyone was trying to get as much sleep as possible i was very disappointed that water has to be requested usually there is some water available in the galley without any asking but this was not the case and also the movies available had nothing controversial on the list
816,air arabia,7,i was pleasantly surprised,marrakesh to london i had read some pretty bad reviews about air arabia however i was pleasantly surprised the was an issue regarding checking in we were unable to check in online but had no problem checking in at the airport the flight was on time the staff pleasant and we arrived 20 min ahead of schedule the was plenty of leg room and i would fly again with air arabia
7138,citilink,1,took me 50 minutes to check in,jakarta to penang i made a booking through the website and paid however the confirmation email i received says my status is on hold they never sent me another email with further updates till the day i flew on my flight date i arrived at the airport and the tv where they display the checkin counters says citilink counter 3348 i queued and waited for my turn then the staff took 1 minute to check my details and issue my boarding pass however she soon realized her mistake and tore my boarding pass she told me to walk to the international counters at gate 8090 i noticed that i was on seat 18f i got there and noticed there were 3 queues 2 for penang 955 am 1 for kl all 3 queues were not that long and it took me 50 minutes to check in because the staff serving my counter took a long time to check in a family of 10 i get that it is a big group but 50 minutes both the penang queues werent moving my flight was at 955 am and at 905 am i was still queuing behind the same family eventually at 910 am penang passengers started jumping queues because it was so slow they didnt have an automatic ticket kiosk to check in passengers without bags by the time she was done i had to run to my gate there was still a line to pass through immigration i was on seat 30f because i was one of the last to check in again the flight was similar to other a320 flights around the region
6530,cathay dragon,5,very poor service,hong kong to hangzhou very poor service with no clear explanation for flight delay this airline always delays one flight with fewer customers in order not to delay other flights with more customers for example the flight from hong kong to hangzhou flight number ka622 is frequently delayed for 34 hours due to airlines poor operations of flight schedules but not because of weather conditions
11202,iberia,3,my worst flight by far,one week before our flight from san francisco to barcelona my husband got covid i was told to email salud that was it just salud i was told to ask for a credit one month later nothing no response no nothing i took the trip with some family members i paid for a more up front seat and was put in a middle seat in the middle of the plane flight attendants absolutely useless skip the insanity and choose a different airline all family members were scattered all over the plane my worst flight by far

18065,silkair,4,limitations of the aircraft,cairns to singapore this was a long and tiring flight on a boeing 737 silkair tries to make the best of a bad situation but the sad truth is that a 7 hour flight requires flat bed seats in business class and that can be accomplished only in a bigger aircraft like a 777 the seats do not recline enough to withstand a 7 hour flight the lounge at cairns is compact but sufficient the in flight attendants were good but were again stymied by the limitations of the aircraft there is very limited in flight entertainment silkair must either operate the 777 on this segment or simply hand over this route to singapore airlines
2268,air mauritius,6,second time no souvenirs,johannesburg to mauritius on the a350900 all were good except that my 7 years old daughter was not on the list for souvenirs as other kids on board were my main concern is my return flight jan 18 2019 on the a319 im a 90kgs guy and my nightmare started once the flight took off with the front passenger who decided its time to rest so she leaned her seat backwards i was squeezed even the magazines i couldnt read as the space was very tight arrived the time for lunchthe hostess served her and didnt inform her she need to put her seat back to its normal position im the one you did it by tapping on her arm to please move forward so i can eat properly she wasnt very happy by me asking but i couldnt care more as i paid to travel i saw the hostess distributing a small backpack bag to the kids then again nothing for my daughter and i asked this timewhat the criteria to qualify to receive was told my daughter wasnt on the list second time no souvenirs was told they would post them to us but didnt mention which year until today sunday feb 03 there is no updates from air mauritius about it
20534,tigerair,3,staff were lazy and unhelpful,adelaide to melbourne staff were lazy and unhelpful they appeared more interested in selling extras and assessing baggage weight than providing service while nobody expects luxury from a budget airline courtesy shouldnt be dependent on ticket price
19694,tam airlines,5,tam airlines customer review,flying a domestic flight almost 5 hours from sao paulo to belem doesnt give the passenger the right to request a pillow or blanket after my own experience i got the answer that they were just for international flights as a frequent flyer i had never experienced that before i frequently fly with qantas on a short flight 1 hr 45 mins duration where i have a pillow and blanket as well hot meal for main meals or a decent lunch in between
1954,air india express,4,air india express customer review,singapore to calcutta return an adequate performance from this budget carrier the flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly the only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies however the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasnt a big problem the tickets were 50 cheaper than the only other carrier to offer nonstop flights on this route singapore air so overall i was extremely pleased with air india express
1334,air canada rouge,7,pleasantly surprised by the experience,manchester to toronto having read the reviews i was quite concerned and pleasantly surprised by the actual experience the flight was on time clean and the staff were friendly and helpful yes the seats were slimline we had to take our own ipad and the food was basic but for someone who mainly flies budget airlines within europe it really wasnt too bad at all we were also pleasantly surprised to find a charging point to keep our ipad which wed stocked up with netflix to keep us going a 23kg luggage allowance free transit of kids car seats and pillows and blankets i think that as long as you dont expect the actual full air canada offer and are aware of the differences with rouge then for us at least it was a cheap and effective way to get to our destination
13674,level,3,confusing cabin bag rules,vienna to paris being late for my planned flight i needed to find an alternative solution to get from vienna to paris last minute prices for austrian and air france began from 200 euro but level cost just 130 so i took it the website was very basic but let me easily purchase my ticket and obtain mobile boarding pass absolutely trouble free their cabin bag rules are confusing for european flights they allow 20 cm thick wheeled bag but advertise intercontinental allowance which is 23 cm be careful since at the gate they put frame to check size and scale to check weight flight was delayed by 1 hr with no explanation gate staff third party were there but didnt have real time info as well their web site doesnt have flight status function at all when plane finally arrived and we were able to board it appeared to be a321 heavily used not so heavily cleaned with some broken tables the legroom was generous the plane was 15 full the lights were off during the whole flight we landed at 9 pm the inflight service was the highest grade of nothing special explanations for the reason of delay had been never given they made 2 passes with trolley back and fourth along the aisle in total darkness and in total silence and that probably was an attempt of food and drink sales service no announcement about it i hadnt noticed anyone buying something so in such a strange way was i able to try and test what iag and willy walsh have on offer now the good news were the legroom and the fact they saved my plans for the next day the bad news were that with such a bizarre schedule 3 times a week at different times of the day such prices and such a lack of inflight service and such confusing cabin bag rules i wouldnt be able to find a good reason to include them into my plans

21652,vietnam airlines,8,excellent service and care from the crew,hue airport terminal did not have an elevator at least we were told so so my father as well as other elders had to walk up and down the stairs plus the stairs to the aircraft itself i understand that this has to do with limitation of the airport facilities but it does affect customer convenience the new terminal which i heard many good things about was not opened at the time i was there in flight experience was good overall with excellent service and care from the crew and good food
103,aegean airlines,4,baggage came with 1 hour delay and broken,the baggage came with 1 hour delay and broken since then over a month has passed and i have not yet been refunded or received new baggage on the telephone they do nothing except saying it is summer and it is normal to delay definitely not the company it used to be low cost company with premium companys prices
7667,croatia airlines,5,croatia airlines customer review,frankfurt to dubrovnik nothing exceptional just a typical european carrier with not much on board their airplane the pros friendly staff clean airplane snack and drinks the cons really tight fit even with slim seats i am 510 and there was less than 2 spare space no real business just empty middle seat no entertainment no internet could not get emergency row seat assigned since nobody else did row was empty asked staff if i could move there and they agreed
135,aegean airlines,6,simply got worse in service,larnaca to athens i fly aegean twice weekly almost every single week of the year and i could say that 90 of the times their flights are delayed specially the ones towards the end of the day and it is not due to the overall mess that happened this past summer im so many european airpors i can understand that delays pile up along the day but knowing that this happens they should review their schedules or try to catch up during the flight the excuse is most times the same the ridiculous late arrival of the aircraft thank you their app is also faulty lately you call then show them and still dont accept it things like not being able to check in wrong pricing information no incoming messages with flight delays etc also when they change planes and they cannot relocate you in a pay seat you have to call them to get a refund what they dont miss is to send a a silly survey upon landing asking about the quality of the service on board forcing you to chose an area of improvement while not asking for the endtoend experience from reservation check in baggage drop boarding disembarkation luggage they deserve some competition theyve simply got worse in service unfortunately for those of us hooked to them
18965,spirit airlines,1,ended up paying 1000 total,do not use this airline thinking youre gonna save money i paid 500 for my flight and ended up paying 1000 total im not exaggerating and i called to get 100 dollar refund they sent me an automated system who literally answered me with a dot
14065,lot polish airlines,8,seat comfort excellent,very good covid measurements seat comfort excellent newer planes than western airlines food and drinks are reasonable approximately 50 fare savings in comparison with other airlines the only issue is that warsaw airport weather can cause delays 1h delay on the second flight the airport has a very well structured covid border control and easy transit
17262,ryanair,9,two on time flights,two on time flights with the return flight even landing 20 minutes early both flights very friendly cabin crew and clean cabin seats are not that bad and legroom space is not worse or better then other airlines i have flown this route with ryanair many times and surely use their services in the near future again one more due compliment to ground staff in charleroi checkin with two suitcases took exactly 30 seconds

18590,smartwings,9,pleasantly surprised with smartwings,smartwings from prague to dubai a budget airline the service was great for our sixhour flight we were served two meals and one coffee break the staff also served us water inflight entertainment current location were also available i would fly smartwings again if im in the area

6806,central mountain air,3,feel like ive been scammed,flew fort st john airport to prince george airport theres no point in taking central mountain air if you can take westjet or air canada they charge outrageous baggage fees so it doesnt even save you money and the flight times are not always convenient and the aircrafts are small could have had a more comfortable flight for the same amount of money definitely feel like ive been scammed will only take this airline if it goes to some remote city where no other airline goes
13846,lion air,1,the worst customer service,this airline has the worst customer service when my flight got cancelled i was told by the travel agent to contact their customer service cs not knowing that lion replaced it with a different carrier at the same time the cs rep didnt tell me this so i changed my flight to another with different timing after knowing that i could actually take a flight at the same time i contacted cs again but was told that i had to pay the prevailing charges because they can only change free of charge 1x the worst was when i tried to file a complaint instead of assisting a different rep made issues of semantics saying i asked the wrong questions hence i got the wrong answer isnt it their job to give info and enlighten as well as assist inconvenienced customers safe to say i may never use their services again
2992,air tanzania,5,i could not checkin without it,i traveled last evening 1st nov from dar to mumbai it was a tight schedule since i came from arusha and had to take this 1 hr later connecting flight at 1950 to mumbai tc 2400 within an hour i had to get my bags from the domestic terminal to the international and do the rest of the process to be on my flight back home when i came to the counter i was asked for my air suvidha form unfortunately i wasnt aware and the man behind said i could not checkin without it at this time i had all my documents ready both vaccines done in india a local covid test done at arusha a few hrs before the flight i showed the man behind the counter and he refused to move forward saying i could not leave without the air suvidha form duly filled online i dont know how important this form was since no one from here on asked me for the form neither in the airport at dar nor in mumbai he promptly directed me to 2 tanzanian airline employees and they in a very rude tone told me they could do it but it was not for free they demanded 50000 tanzanian to fill the form for me and i reluctantly paid meanwhile i called me agent who booked the ticket for me and she too got on to the job of filling this online form the counter was kept open since this process was on and the ladies signaled to the counter guy probably indicating that the deal is done and they are on the job im not too sure if the counter staff is a part of this racket but im convinced that he is aware if i had chosen to do this with my agent they would have closed the counter on me i say this cause they already told me the counter is closed and my time was up and i had to miss my flight when i first came to check in the deal with the tanzanian lady staff kept the counter open for me finally my agent filled the form and sent me the completed form before these ladies could do it i showed it to them and they confirmed it was ok and asked me to go to the counter the rest is standard process no one asked me for the form i got into the flight which was delayed for more than hr the ladies didnt return my money even though they didnt do the job that was expected considering the greed and the language they used in my brief conversation with them i have great respect for the people of tanzania and admire the courtesy care and hospitality they exhibit but these minor isseues need to be fixed immediately to avoid damage

4156,american airlines,8,american airlines was somewhat impressive,los angeles to dallas fortworth onboard aa2833 on their a321200 my flight departed from the rather smallsized terminal 4 and with the amount of layover i had plus the quick service in los angeles i had plenty of time to kill in the admirals club lounge which was very cozy and comfortable the staff in los angeles were just okay boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined and i was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews takeoff was only 10 minutes late but eventually we landed half an hour ahead of schedule their a321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip led lighting but sadly no personal tvs the seat was cozy and comfortable easy to use and adequately spacious for a 25hour flight like this throughout the flight the flight attendants were friendly courteous and attentive although they couldve been better if they were not just meddling with their phones and reensure that everyone is doing okay once the service is complete the biscoff biscuit was exquisite and tasty the real positive thing about this flight was the wifi it allowed me to browse anything open social media apps and watch videos on the ground for around 20 minutes once i took off the social media apps and browsing feature no longer existed but live tv shows videos movies and games were provided through the american airlines portal the signal strength was quite poor but the contents and the layout of the portal were incredibly good despite landing 30 minutes ahead of schedule the baggage delivery at dallas fort worth was ridiculously slow causing me to wait around 4560 minutes overall my experience and first impression onboard american airlines was somewhat impressive also if youre asking for help contact them via twitter or use the live chat feature they can sometimes be faster than the phone team
18002,sichuan airlines,8,sichuan airlines customer review,shanghai to chongqing 30 july 2013 very efficient a319 a little long in the tooth however spotless inside excellent leg room arrival 10 minutes early with bags delivered a few minutes after arrival in hall choice of meals on offer
13915,lion air,2,needs to learn to respect peoples time,flew jakarta to bali the delay remains the same i got a 60 to 90 minute delay today it is like delays are part of the behaviour and culture in this airline in this era where people are very busy and dont have one day only to fly from one place to another lion air needs to learn to respect peoples time so if you do not have the whole day spare time just to fly lion air is the last choice you should make i think they have to improve to be on time unless they will lose customers
21531,usbangla airlines,7,staff were good,dhaka to bangkok good service though it made delay while departing very good food staff were good price was a bit high when i purchased no entertainment screen on board
15632,onur air,6,onur air customer review,lutonbodrum flight on time fast checkin it was a 3x3 configuration and asked for an aisle seat and told wed have to sit adjacent both on the aisle no different to other budget airlines glad we did that on this airline as theres no doubt in my mind that the seat pitch is one of the smallest for a budget airline width ok but neither of us is remotely tall yet the pocket on the seat in front was brushing my knees even when empty of the things i usually stuff in it seemed quite claustrophobic for those by the window and middle worse if the seat in front gets tipped back plane in good condition clean and everything that was supposed to work was working cabin staff a trifle remote is smiling banned tin of coke cost 270 and assume everything else was expensive too followed advice on this site and took our own drinkssnacks inbound comments a week later would be the same as those above asked for 2 aisle seats and got them but passengers behind us not so lucky stewardesses smiled a bit more this time during turbulence they walked down the aisle halfheartedly checking seatbelts were done up but werent bothered if they couldnt actually see both directions they seem to get the luggage off fast assume quick turnaround required safety briefings in english all in all id use them again though not necessarily as my first budget choice need another couple of inches between me and the seat in front
13524,latam airlines,4,cant be this incompetent,after i got badly hurt during an attempted robbery in quito ecuador i could no longer proceed to travel to peru and bolivia so i provided latam airlines with the information and evidence they needed and asked for a refund of both tickets it was incredibly frustrating to communicate with their customer service it was like 6 different people were handling my case without communicating with each other several times i got send the same emails by different people asking for information i already gave them either they did not understand or did not want to understand me to be honest at a certain point i got the feeling that all this confusion was on purpose just to discourage me from getting my refunds back also based on reading reviews from other passengers youre supposed to be a professional airline you cant be this incompetent can you eventually i got a full refund for one ticket which is good but i still lost 54597 at this point im just too tired to pursue it anymore so all i can do is warn my fellow traveler if the flight goes well be happy but if problems arise you have been warned
5702,blue air,9,very good value,liverpool to milan bergamo not a very full flight so had an entire row to myself aircraft wasnt very new however took off on time offered a non alcoholic drink and 2 vegetarian sandwiches at no cost any other snacks were charged for very good value when i only paid 25 for a ticket
18380,sky express airlines,5,not enough space in the lockers,there was not enough space in the lockers over our seats for our luggage and the staff split our luggage group of 7 in several lockers all over the aircraft after our landing we had to wait all passengers to get off the plane and take our luggage
7385,condor airlines,3,those who consider traveling it should beware,my wife travelled this airline from johannesburg south africa on 14 january and had a really terrible experience departure was delayed by 2 hours connecting flight information at frankfurt was ambiguous which meant she was not even sure of when her next flight will be or where it will be boarding she was also served breakfast that did not meet her dietary requirements i also was quite concerned for her safety and wellbeing i think that this airline should not be operating those who consider traveling it should beware
12637,jetstar pacific,5,jetstar pacific customer review,sgn to han check in was a nightmare chaotic and disorganised one staff uttered something in vietnamese and all hell broke loose everyone just ran up to the counter we did not know what was going on it was an old a320 food prices were reasonable good thing flight was on time
20868,transavia,2,no cleaning of the plane has been done,flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process we had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards but wth the boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight as a result the entire passenger queue already after passing the passes control has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded obviously no cleaning of the plane has been done we have found some used napkins on our seats speaking of the seats those were extremely uncomfortable they did have an average leg space for a lowcost ill give them that but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either the armrests could only have been raised halfway so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without ive even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats now im writing this from home with severe back pain that ive experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and i blame the seats for the reference the specific plane was phhzx curiously enough the first flight amssvq didnt have these issues the only thing i can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport but i expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway in any case now my stance towards the airline is never again unless im really forced to
6887,china airlines,9,consider china airlines again,san francisco to manila via taipei all 4 segments of our flights went relatively well there were no hassles and the fare we paid was good especially since this was for christmas peak season the san franciscotaipei and taipeisan francisco flights both were excellent but the taipeimanila and manilataipei were okay sfotpe checkin was a breeze and there were no hassles with the luggage although we were slightly overweight by a fraction the b777300er plane we flew looks fairly new we got seats 71h 71k perfect for couples food was good service was decent there were lots of entertainment options movies etc and monitor was huge and resolution was sharp toilet was clean and i was told flight crew periodically clean itwipe it down which was well appreciated they exceeded my expectations tpemnl we had 15 hours of transit time but lines were very long through security aircraft was a330 with a 242 configuration we loved the fact that we were seated on a pair of seats as we like to keep to ourselves service was decent nothing exceptional food was okay there were some entertainment options on board including movies but since this was a 2hour flight it was not enough to finish a complete movie the aircraft was also older and the monitor was smaller and not as sharp than the b777300er mnltpe same aircraft as tpemnl with similar experience my only unfavorable comment was that restrooms werent clean on this flight some passenger completely made a mess in the entire lavatory and it appears flight crew do not clean this possibly because it was a very short flight tpesfo similar comments as ci003 sfotpe we were seated on 70h 70k we really loved the pair of seats in the back again food and service were excellent no transit issues as we purposely took the 11hour layover to see the city however immigration line took 15 hours not good otherwise the experience was good overall we were very pleased with our experience flights were on time products and services were good luggage came as expected and there were no significant inconvenienceshassles we would consider flying china airlines again
17039,royal brunei airlines,9,great value for money,my second time flying with royal brunei from melbourne to london with stops in bwn and dxb still great value for money the cabin crew pleasant except for the young male flight attendant on the brunei to melbourne leg who was so busy flirting with two young girls sitting next to me he twice failed to ask me if i would like a drink my vegetarian meals were the same type as last year and it was boring vegetarian meals dont have to be that boring some vegie lasagne curry sausages anything but the same old things over and over would be nice get a different catering company
7354,condor airlines,2,business class below standard,business class below standard despite the new airplane with economy seats fitted into business class shells lying flat definitely not a business class seat very uncomfortable and narrow not suitable for tall people boarding was a mess keeping us waiting 75 minutes standing without any news about what was happening the call centre barely speaks english strange service with first row of business being more expensive and getting different amenities than other passengers kept on promoting paid upgrades until the flight left as if trying to collect money as much as possible definitely a low cost business class below standards airline company despite the publicity made around the new aircraft and seats would not advise to fly condor at all even in business class in the airbus a330 neo
2799,air serbia,2,many problems are showing up,belgrade to amsterdam serious bag and problems during online check in process they need to fix this at once once you have selected and paid for seat in online checkin process you cant go back or deselect them and return to a free one the only thing you can do and that i found out after calling customer support is to wait for a manual restart of checkin process and that needs approx 2 hours what will happen if your credit card is not accepted for seat payment like in my case and you are checking in just hours before the flight customer support was not surprised by my question like its something normal she even suggested to leave her with credit card information so that they can authorize by themself air serbia looks like a fresh and modern aviation company from the outside but from the inside many problems are showing up hopefully management will change soon with addition to government of serbia stepping out from owner structure
13084,kulula,3,service little unprofessional,i experienced over 2 hour delays on both kulula flights to and from george from johannesburg which caused extreme dissatisfaction as plans had to be rearranged and some fell through i also checked in online but my seats that i had specifically chosen were disregarded as another aircarft had to be used the service was in my opinion a little unprofessional and i found it really disappointing as i felt that i did not get my moneys worth regarding both flights not very keen to use this airline again as delayed flights seem to be a pattern

17112,royal jordanian airlines,3,refused to do refund,rj cancelled my flight and refused to do refund and provided only one option to use a voucher which i accepted there were no mention that vouchers are non refundable few months later i wanted to use the voucher but there were no rj trips from sydney to cairo which is the original trip then i asked for refund and here comes the problem they started sending me to different departments and ignoring my refund request then i waited for sometime and tried to book again but still no flights i when i complained again that all other airlines now have flights on those routes i got a response to call customer service and when calling customer service they tells no flights and you can email customer care email customer care and they point you to customer service really bad experience one positive note that all customer service employees were personable but not helpful

7676,croatia airlines,8,planes are always clean,nice little european airline planes are always clean staff friendly food as expected on short haul intereu flights seats are slim leather and comfortable same through the airplane with middle seat empty in business class as is the standard in the region great and efficient customer service over the phone or by email they have their own little flyonline club where if you purchase five tickets online through them you get the sixth for free of the same classtype as the other five which is great if you travel a lot overall among the better local services within the eu
19921,thai airasia,6,you get what you pay for,this is one of the busiest routes in the world so book early and dont think you will luck out and get an empty seat next to you or like we did book an aisle seat for the wife and a window seat for yourself and hope no one will book the middle seat we have tried it more than once and there is a better chance of winning the lottery as you would expect from a budget airline everything is cramped and rushed but you get what you pay for
11395,icelandair,4,would not fly icelandair ever again,if i had any other option i would not fly icelandair ever again in march they cancelled my flight from gatwick to keflavik less than a week before the fly date rebooked me on another flight which was then cancelled again 3 days before the departure even after i contacted their customer service to make sure that it will not be cancelled they told me that it will 100 not be cancelled cause theyre trying to bring all the natives home because of covid im icelandic so was reassured by this which was a huge mistake i ended up buying a last minute flight with easyjet to get home to my family so overall it cost me between 1k15k with the many train tickets i had to buy cause they kept cancelling and the last minute flight didnt get my refund until september and that was after i contacted the ceo directly during summer and easter i kept calling their customer service which just told me that im in a queue to get a refund complete bollocks since people who got their flights cancelled in julyaugust were getting their refunds while i was still waiting from march now i need to get back to the uk since my university is starting again icelandair is the only airline flying between uk and iceland that doesnt have any connections in different countries right now so i had no chocie to book with them again my flight was supposed to be this saturday and i just received an email from them that it was cancelled 2 days before departure they rebooked me for sunday but i wouldnt be surprised at all if i got an email from them tomorrow or on sat that that flight will be cancelled as well not to mention i already booked the train tickets and the hotel for saturday and changing that to sunday cost me yet again a lot of money and i had to call my student accommodation and let them now of the change in plans as well if you have any other option then icelandair even if its more expensive choose it
18335,sky airline,4,online checkin did not work,lima to mendoza via santiago online checkin did not work my layover was 4 hours and 10 minutes so the airline would not check my luggage to my final destination i had to collect baggage at my layover clear customs and recheck it again was charged separate checked luggage fee for each connecting flight legroom was among the shortest i have ever seen
6903,china airlines,9,friendly and helpful,taipei to gatwick really impressive service and comfort im a tall person and still had plenty of leg room the staff are friendly and helpful and attentive if you are english speaking you may struggle a little as the airline is very chinese focused so language could be a problem not a big problem but have patience and humor the airport at taiei is fantastic we were in transit both ways the transit area is bright and spacious for me and my wife we had no problems id happily go again as soon as im over the jet lag the food was excellent i must say
75,adria airways,4,adria airways customer review,ljublijanaamsterdam a great little airline although the crj200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew their inflight magazine is in english and slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information same cant be said about brnk international airport however this airport needs a spruce up to say the least
20396,thomas cook airlines,9,a very good product,used thomas cook airlines from london to cape town return in their premium class i was worried as their reviews were very mixed i must say i was impressed by their premium cabin and the staff looking after it priority checkin priority boarding and a decent sized seat wider than bas premium product although only 35in legroom which felt spacious enough a few small issues they ran out of a specific meal choice by the time they came to us we sat in row 1ac which was annoying but nothing big as the meals were tasty and drinks were plentiful row 1 does not have the same leg room as the rest of the premium cabin due to the bulkhead in front you cannot stretch your legs out the inflight entertainment system is basic in terms of offerings but it was included in premium in economy you have to pay 450 to unlock it on the way back we had row 7 and it felt much more comfortable being able to stretch out your legs under the seat in front all in all a very good product which i will definitely use again and highly recommend being able to fly direct from gatwick to cape town and still pay the equivalent ba economy fare and get premium is an added bonus well done thomas cook see you again soon
15149,nordstar,7,a satisfactory experience,omsk to krasnoyarsk i was a little unsure as to what to expect from a second tier russian company however the check in process was quick and efficient although it was done only in russian and i had to move a little weight from my checked in luggage to my hand luggage the flight departed and arrived on time the plane was quite small but legroom was still adequate it was subject to turbulence as we were approaching the landing the cabin crew appeared not to speak english as announcements were only in russian a good snack was served on the almost two hour long flight my luggage came off the flight fairly quickly all in all a satisfactory experience
22063,viva air,3,many hidden prices,medellin to miami this airline is the worst airline i have ever flown they have many hidden prices the seats are very uncomfortable worse than spirit their customer service is terrible and very careless with everything you pay for this airline in extras you pay for a much better one and even in first class what a way to steal from people
16111,play,9,staff were very attentive,wonderful value for the amount paid for ticket staff were very attentive airplane was immaculate and everything ran on time we landed twenty minutes ahead of time
14718,meridiana,8,meridiana customer review,gatwick to florence return no problems with checkin staff flight departures or arrivals served a soft drink and crackers on the plane which is all we expected for a short flight
14778,monarch airlines,8,fas were attentive and ever present,flew monarch from birmingham to funchal good flights both ways fas were attentive and ever present lots of leg room in the extra leg room seats which cost an additional 57 so not particularly cheap but i think worth it for a 4 hour flight im not particularly tall but there was a good 6 inches between my knees and the seat in from to me on the return leg arrived 25 minutes early shame it was birmingham 20 minutes to find steps to disembark the aircraft
9693,fly540com,4,fly540com customer review,we had a ticket to fly darznz but on arrival to dar from nbo a member of the staff was waiting for us to inform us that the flight had been delayed so much that they were putting us on another flight operated by a competitor so we never got to fly with them but we were quite impressed at how they had arranged everything for us the agent stayed with us at the gate until we departed i thought it was great service
20294,thai smile airways,6,so not impressed,the staff service was alright but whats not alright was that my luggage was broken and all i got in return was an offer of 500 baht less than 15 usd or let them fix my luggage which would take around 34 weeks honestly it would cost me more than 500 baht to fix the luggage and in case if it cannot be fixed i couldnt even buy the new luggage with the given money the ticket is more expensive than other airline but the responsibility is not as high as the ticket price if this is how they handle your luggage think about how they will handle other important stuff highly not recommended so not impressed
5562,belavia,5,belavia customer review,msqkgdmsq economy flights were around the new year and usual for this route crj 100200 were replaced with larger aircraft minskkaliningrad with tu154m cabin looked newer than expected and more comfortable although the cabin design was the lowest priority apparently the crew were polite and very helpful the inflight service decent for the 50 min flight including cold drinks coffee tea and a small chocolate return flight was a packed and extremely shabby b737300 with no leg room the crew very much inferior to the previous one rude and inattentive the website and online check in are functional the international airport minsk 2 is horrible with no attempts from the staff to make things easier but this is not a major problem because it is empty
17925,shanghai airlines,4,shanghai airlines customer review,sha pek economy on b767300 booked online passport was sufficient checking in a matter of seconds the plane was clean comfy seats and most generous legroom i have ever experienced in an economy seat 2x3x2 configuration was nice relatively friendly but not overwhelming staff probably speaking not too much english got along with chinese well food was ok chinese certainly not for everyone though 3 drinks in roughly 90 minutes are far above domestic european standards only annoying thing the standard please remain seated turbulence ahead messages every chinese carrier plays all the time even if there wont be any
15969,philippine airlines,3,the worst airport experience,the worker at los angeles that helped us at checkin was very accommodating and helpful the cabin crew helped us when we couldnt find a space in the overhead bin near our seats and informed us where they placed had no problems with entertainment flying back from manila is a completely different story the entertainment on mnl to lax kept buffering and the flight map showed multiple times that it was unavailable for the workers most of those on the manila to la flight looked like they hate their job the checkin worker was so strict on the weight of our carryon luggage so we had to remove some belongings which didnt happen to us in los angeles not one cabin crew member informed us where they placed our luggage when there was no overhead bin space near our seats so we had to wait for basically every passenger to leave so that we could find our luggage i dont know why there was such a discrepancy between the workers in lax vs mnl but the checkin and flight back was honestly the worst airport experience ive had so far
18109,silkair,5,legroom was uncomfortable,i recently flew from cairns to bangalore via singapore with silkair return the aircraft was new and had a modern interior the legroom though for a 6hr flight from cairns to singapore was inadequate and uncomfortable also i found that when asking for minor things like some water the staff seemed uninterested and like i was putting them out also poor selection of choice from the silkair studio to watch a movie through the inflight wifi on your device food was ok and adequate but took a very long time to be served much longer than most airlines i have flown some positives though is the convenience to get to india especially from a regional city like cairns with only one stop instead of two unlike before also the price of the ticket was very reasonable considering it was peak season for travel to india overall though i may look to fly another carrier in the future as my overall experience with silkair was not that great would much prefer to stick to singapore airlines
12548,jetstar pacific,7,meagre limit which is only 7kgs,regional flight danang to hong kong before xmas 2019 on newish a320 aircraft had to change ticket prior to travel and it went quite ok though had to pay another 45 usd even that i had purchased a bundle convenience packet with the ticket adding free services and further luggage i got three emails prior to flight warning about excessive luggage and charges flight on time checkin was quick and easy no hassle with luggage though my handluggage was 6kg over the meagre limit which is only 7kgs which is almost impossible to comply with for international travellers i had two suitcases inscribed from danang arrived very quickly in hong kong onboard a prepaid hot food package turned out to be very delicious flight was full but staff were on top of passengers and served well i recommend that jetstar pacific should decide clearly whether to go tom be legacy carrier or low cost as now it is between 2 chairs and overly focused on charging for luggage
1864,air india,3,not friendly to customers,i travelled on ai171 from ahmedabad to london gatwick on 20 th april and during beverages i asked cabin crew for two cans of beer so was served later i asked for more beer and cabin crew lady said you can have later i waited two hours and i called and asked and she said i cant have beer she was not friendly to customers also tv screen was not working
20009,thai airways,8,nice and easy flight,first time i was flying back at 1pm rather than 1am i thought i was going to struggle that wasnt to be the case nice and easy flight i do tend to find flying back physically easier maybe not mentally food was good and a sufficient amount of movies to watch only downside was the flight seemed to take a lot longer than ever before verging on 13 hours plus
14812,monarch airlines,4,you pay for what you get,manchester to fuertaventura with monarch airlines we opted to buy extra legroom seats and were pleased that we did on the outbound leg we were about 40 minutes late taking off which they blamed on need to deice the plane but in truth we did not start boarding until 10 minutes after departure time and this was slowed by a demand for some passengers to put their hand luggage in the hold due i think to items for the return flight being stored in the overhead lockers by the staff flight was good and arrived only just behind schedule the return flight was smooth and arrived ahead of time monarch is very like a lot of other low cost airlines and you pay for what you get a seat on the plane anything else is extra and at 4 for a small can of lager 180 for a can of pepsi max and 450 for a bacon panini plus hold luggage charges and so on can work out very expensive the panini by the way was very hot very dried out and tasteless staff were pleasant and professional throughout a good airline compared to some low cost options
39,adria airways,5,service onboard was poor,frankfurt to ljubljana with adria airways boarding was ontime but aircraft was parked on remote gate about 15 minutes from main terminal so we departed about 25 minutes late service onboard was poor with no complimentary drinks or snacks they are available only for sale arrival was 15 minutes later than scheduled crew was friendly
3789,akasa air,7,it was a great journey for me,it was my first flight journey from mumbai to bangalore thank you akasa air teams for smooth check in enjoyed my first flight overall it was a great journey for me
20602,tigerair,6,its a decent airline,singapore to bangkok with tigerair a budget asian carrier its hub is in singapore and it flies a pretty extensive network around southeast asia inlaws in singapore recommended tiger over its main competitors airasia and jetstar we have flown with them numerous times the latest being a trip to bngkok and back checking in at changi in singapore was a breeze as there was for the first time no line at the counter checking in at bangkok was a lot more troublesome as a group of seven was in line ahead of us and instead of using the group checkin line used the regular line a substantial line developed behind this group as the tigerair agent appeared to be relatively new on the job and seemed flustered another agent opened up and he took care of us quickly tigerair has a good boarding system when they follow it and so boarding is usually quite quick tiger has a couple of a319s but mostly use a320s on their routes seat pitch is minimal at 30 so its a little hard on me at 62 tall but its not unbearable as most of the flights we take are only 225 hours in duration there is no ife meal or beverage service unless paid for and no inseat power planes are kept quite neat and the seats apart from the legroom are pretty comfortable i wouldnt want to fly tiger much more than the 225 hours that weve done in the past but for flights under this duration its a decent airline and much to the shame of this american offers a similar flight experience to the big three us legacy carriers
16002,philippine airlines,5,dont care much about frequent flyers,the focus of my review at this time is on their mabuhay miles frequent flyer program i usually take a domestic flight which will connect to manila or cebu for an international flight all via pal this saves me from trouble in case i would miss my connection from experience they would rebook me to the next flight for free if there are problems with the connection and that is okay but accommodation and food arent included though thats fine by me with so many flights i became a frequent flyer and their program is useful in terms of extra baggage allowance and priority tag priority boarding and lounge access but thats it they dont care much about frequent flyers in other aspects especially redemption if you redeem a oneway international flight ticket expect that your hard earned miles are to be practically useless because you will still pay a huge amount even if you redeem a round trip ticket you will still pay hefty airline charges because apparently the miles are only for the base fare ive been so used to flying with sq where i only pay the very minimal 10 airport tax upon miles redemption even for a oneway mnlsin ticket so i find pals redemption rules weird and a money grab then theres the problem with redemption nominees that can be easily done online with other airlines like sq but not pal its like 1995 you need visit their ticket office or call their hotlines if you want to redeem for other people they would have you wait for 2 to 3 hours at their ticket office worst experience in their ticket office in alabang then charge you a rush fee for redemption made less than 10 days from the intended flight from the provinces in pi i now take an extra day for layover in manila just to fly with other airlines because pal is getting ridiculous if their frequent flyer program doesnt change then good bye
23158,zipair,1,be prepared for any inconvenience,i bought a flight from zipair in july i will flight 24 of august from singapore to japan and take my new flight from japan to brazil in 28 of august in 22 of august i went to a clinic in singapore and i and my grandchild did the pcr test in 23 of august in the evening i received a email from zipair saying that my flight was cancelled one day before the flight departure and the next flight available will be only 28 of august same day that my flight from emirates will leave japan so i had to buy a new ticket that cost four time more from another company and i had to do a new pcr express test that cost me 280sgd per person total 560sgd 2300sgd for a new ticket when i asked for refund the first assistant told me that the zipair will refund the pcr test too but when i asked for a refund the company refunded only the ticket value be prepared for any inconvenience as it is not a reliable company
9365,fiji airways,7,crew superfriendly always smiling,nadi to los angeles i checked in online and it was super easy the flight was only 34 full and the seat next to me was empty for this 11hour flight i get to the airport for baggage drop i dont see the purpose of having that because the girl serving the counter was really slow the business class line had been cleared and i dropped my bags there and by the time i was done the girl at the baggage drop was still serving the same people as she was when i came in the flight was delayed in boarding because their system was out they then did boarding manually but even then we managed to pick up speed and arrived on time the cabin crew were once again the highlight of the experience superfriendly always smiling and making rounds of the cabin with drinks and water quite frankly the only reason i fly fiji airways is for the cabin crew the ground staff have a lot to learn from them the deboarding was delayed because there were issues with the aerobridge
7524,copa airlines,5,service was indifferent at best,chicago to colombia in business three of four flights were fine with the exception of the ctgpty flight service was indifferent at best on the ptyord flight after the meal the flight attendant did not walk through the cabin until the plane was arriving i tried to give her some trash to throw away but she just told me to leave it in the seat pocket classy the breakfast on the way to pty was pretty bad but the dinner on the way to ord was good the inflight wifi didnt work on either of the two long flights to and from ord none of the planes had power outlets the flight from pty to mde inbound aircraft from yul had new business class seats that were further apart however all the other planes had standard business class seats that would not be good for an overnight flight ground staff were friendly and we had no baggage problems the lounge in pty was a disappointment blaming covid there was almost no food just a few packaged cookies and salty products and only beer and tiny glasses of wine available copa got us where were wanted to go but there was nothing impressive or especially pleasurable about the experience i might fly them again because of the easy pty connections but i wouldnt go out of my way to do so
22779,wizz air,6,real issue is the checkin method,absolutely basic service however the staff seemed friendly and patient my only real issue is the checkin method you are charged extra if you dont check in online this is fair enough as you are told in advance however even using the wizz air app you are not given a boarding pass until you get to the airport where this is given at the desk on checking your passport this is a right pain in the neck it meant that although i had no hold luggage i had to stand in a very long queue waiting behind others checking in luggage just ot receive my boarding pass as a 67 year old man with some hip problems this was very painful and very unnecessary as it would be simple to provide a no hold baggage desk with a shorter waiting time and wouldnt cost anything either a pity because otherwise is competes quite well with other low cost airlines
18442,sky express airlines,9,totally satisfied with the flights,i flew round trip from athens to kalymnos with sky express airlines i was totally satisfied with the flights only around 10 minutes delay for both flights check in luggage was included in the fare also at athens airport after the check in i was offered a free coffee refreshment at the lounge bar and i was allowed to use the fast lane for the security check
9394,finnair,2,cabin service lacks big time,not worth the money food options and quality is pretty bad cabin service lacks big time kids had nothing worthwhile to eat and flight attendants were of little help on dallas helsinki leg some weird sweet stuff was served for breakfast dinner options were bad on helsinkidelhi leg there was no breakfast served at all except a sweet bun better to avoid finnair if you are going to india from us
4797,austrian airlines,6,lose your handluggage,be careful when flying late fridays the plane might be overbooked when they ask you to come forward if you want to check hand luggage in even at no expense from get it done else they will lose your handluggage which just creates big headaches the will not assist you in any way once it is lost
20777,transaero airlines,7,transaero airlines customer review,pekvkotlvvkopek flew with a premium economy seat online checkin was a bit painful due to age old software but the airline staff at the counter were excellent to resolve the issue and made a smooth checkin for us and offered an emergency exit seat i knew before hand about the poor inflight entertainment so i carried an ipad with several movies and music in it cabin crew were on par with other airlines and spoke very little english which wasnt an issue at all no wine or alcohol being served in the cabin but the generous flow of fruit juices candies and chocolates made my travel bit comfortable i would definitely fly them again
2377,air moldova,8,my ticket cost very little,i flew air moldova from chisinau to vienna flight left and landed ontime onboard service consisted of 2 large and tasty sandwiches accompanied by drinks including alcoholic which are rare on some european airlines the seats were comfortable plane was clean and the cabin crew were kind and helpful my ticket cost very little
3136,airasia,3,impossible to talk to a human,booked 7 flights with airasia around 4 months before my holiday around 2 month before the flights were supposed to take place the nightmare started they started to cancel flights for technical reasons sometimes offering alternatives that were not too bad same route just a couple of hours earlier or later sometimes they offered nothing in the end of the 7 flights only 2 happened within 1h of the originally booked time the highlight was a flight that was cancelled and begrudgingly i agreed to their alternative which was 14h earlier after having rearranged the other flights this affected a couple of weeks before the flight the alternative was moved to within 2h of the original flights time even days before the flights they kept moving them around making my heart sink every time i got a message from airasia with the word urgent in the title their customer service chatbot is making it impossible to talk to a human or hand in a claim you just go in circles with it offering you useless options the positives were that if it was other airasia flights that were affected by these cancellations it was pretty painless to move them around and most of the flights were punctual
14135,lufthansa,1,simply playing some games,lufthansa misplaced 4 out of my 5 suitcases between me and my flight party they delivered them in the next few day to a week after arrival i filed a claim and i received a response in january they they will offer a small compensation i am keep asking about the compensation money transfer and i am only getting back basically copy and paste massages that they have transferred the funds and i need to wait few more days there has never been any transfers lufthansa is simply playing some games very unprofessional today in may 24 2023 5 month later nothing was sent they even stopped responding to my emails
14707,meridiana,7,meridiana customer review,we flew lgwflr flrlgw outbound slightly delayed with no explanation return unremarkable this carrier offers a great value but deceptive pricing beware that although the transportation document you receive by way of receipt when you buy a ticket says first checked bag is 17 what they mean is first checked bag is 17 if you pay online in advance and print out your confirmation of payment otherwise at checkin you will be asked to pay 355 ticketing fee at the ticket counter in flr then to return to the checkin counter with your receipt to check your bags since flights booked lgwflrlgw are not eligible for online checkin it is easy to miss that 1 there may be another extra web app elsewhere on meridianait you may be able to use to prepay for luggage and 2 there may be a different price for checked bagage paid for at the airport than the price indicated on the receipt you receive when you buy a ticket we bought an extremely cheap ticket 214 round trip for two pax but i would have preferred that they bundle in this extra effective 23 surcharge for being a nonexpert into the ticket price it makes them look slimy to advertise a product at one price and to actually charge a difference price flight was unremarkable seats cramped but manageable staff friendly enough most seats dont recline very much
4266,american eagle,4,a mediocre experience,lets start with the bad that is terminal f and philadelphia it just is not a nice place though the food court is nice lex is pretty pleasant however and every single aa employee i talked to at both airports and on the flight were pretty good my biggest issue was space im 58 and about 175 pounds and i was cramped into the little erj so overall a mediocre experience also this flight was a piedmont airlines flight operating as american eagle
21928,virgin australia,7,staff were friendly and helpful,check in was straightforward and the plane left on time staff were friendly and helpful all food and drink except coffee tea and water had to be purchased which was no big deal as the flight was about two hours
4882,avelo airlines,9,i would use them again,avelo is new to wilmington de avelo did an awesome job with leaving and getting there on time both ways sent out text for checking in checking in a checked bag went well with no issues paid for a carry on for meds swim suitchange of clothes also took a small back pack for the ipad book snacks that fit under the seat no snacks offered but a small bottle of water if you ask for it lead flight attendant did an awesome job getting a few people in line who kept getting up when the seat belt sign was on i would use them again both ways they had a new flight attendant and they were very nice working with her to get her qualified now the wilmington airport is a different story it is a small airport where you get onoff on the tarmac which is no big deal on the return flight home there was another avelo plane a that just landed when you walked into the area to get you baggage it was jammed pack with people 2 door slide up and bags where placed through the opening with everyone trying to see their bag 2 planes worth of people what a mess it took 45 minutes by the time we were off the plane until we got our luggage at one point they were loading stuff from one cart to another it would of been easier if they did not have 2 planes unloading at the same time yes we would fly with them again just have to have patience at wilmington de airport
20031,thai airways,9,90 of what they used to be kamapin,i had booked this trip as a miles trip due to expiring miles the cash tickets for these flights were quite expensive since we were rop gold members we could use the priority counter which has been relocated to row h at suvarnabhumi airport it used to be at row b check in was smooth since we were flying to japan the agent asked if we had filled out japan pass which made us clear immigration and customs really quickly in nagoya during the evening the royal orchid prestige lounge was extremely crowded however we did find a corner to ourselves far from the main food area but close to the bar halal food area which had fewer options there was more than enough food and we werent hungry when the flight took off so we could get more sleep i also used a shower suite where loccitane liquid soap and shampoo were provided boarding was an absolute mess the crew was late some passengers did not get their documents properly checked this was made worse by the fact that gate c1 had very little seating and lots of passengers ended up sitting on the floor waiting for boarding we had paid extra to get extralegroom seats about 50 usd each and they were worth it the purser suggested that i move to the empty exit row seats in the second cabin so that my mum and brother could have a bit more space and comfort this made the flight much more comfortable for them i hate short overnight flights and a departure time of 0005 wasnt great no alternatives either most of the passengers were asleep before the flight even took off but i had stayed awake to get a bloody mary from the crew who bought me one from the galley prepandemic thai airways had a policy that they would have to serve their gold frequent fliers first i am very glad that they kept this policy i was asked whether i would like omelette with sausage or shrimp pad thai i chose the shrimp pad thai which was very tasty flavourful i jokingly asked if i could get a cappuccino which is normally only available for business class passengers the fa said that she would try to get one for me which she did i asked to be woken up for the meal service 2 hours prior to landing in nagoya after some tossing and turning i was politely awoken had my breakfast placed on my tray the crew were all very nice on both flights on the return flight we flew out from sapporochitose the contract lounge in sapporo had little in the way of amenities or food boarding was much better organised on this flight and we had our meal orders taken after being seated stewed chicken with mash potatoes or spicy fish curry with rice i tasted both on this flight and both were very tasty albeit the fish used is pangas which isnt that great thai used to serve seabass which tastes much better the highlight of the meal was the cake a simple vanilla sponge but really tasty before landing we were served a spinach pie which was also tasty but i wouldve preferred chicken there was a small issue i had with the crew on this flight i found out the tray table wasnt clean when i looked at it during boarding the purser walked through told me to close it for departure but i pointed out the wet table to her she called one of the fas to wipe it up entertainment is slightly lacking they could do with a few more films thai is still a great carrier maybe not as great as the prepandemic thai airways i feel like theyre 90 of what they used to be in 2019
1849,air india,4,pathetic experience,pathetic experience as the seats were not clean no screens were working in the row e the food was not tasty half of the cuisine was made with corns only only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent two female and one male member very nice very uncomfortable seats the experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all when one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite what makes sense out of it dont understand it is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers i think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment air india needs to improve a lot on their quality
6053,british airways,7,economy class seating was truly dreadful,travelled to heathrow to kalamata and return journey 11 days later world traveller aka economy class both flights departed on time return flight landed early but we then had a 1 14 hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure flights ok fas particularly on return flight pleasant enough but as usual economy class seating was truly dreadful no legroom at all no better in club class either only the middle seat left free marked down because of this can only recommend if you are not tall

16503,qantaslink,9,qantaslink customer review,yesterday i flew qantaslink from sydney to dubbo i was impressed with a staff member taking me aside as i immediately entered the check in area and checking me in putting in my frequent flyer number and arranging me to have the seat i requested check in was completed within 2 minutes as i was not checking luggage the lounge waiting area where gates 18 19 was not in the best condition many seats threadbare and torn but that area offered a great viewing area to watch aircraft taking off better than the virgin lounge the aircraft was a bombardier q400 beautiful looking aircraft clean and tidy inside seats were very small however but this was to be expected with a turbo prop aircraft and i was comfortable enough crew were friendly and professional the flight was only 50 minutes and it was great to be in the taxi within 5 minutes of the aircraft arriving at dubbo
2061,air koryo,5,air koryo customer review,pekfnjpek in business class on new tu204 the seats were quite spacious and airplane comfortable i thought it really odd that they served a huge meal pekfnj but only bread on the return the flight attendants were decent enough though english skills were lacking there was access to the air china lounge at pek t2 i didnt visit the lounge on the return at fnj on the flight pekfnj there were no more seats so a north korean teenager sat in the flight attendant jump seat for the whole flight on the way back the security guard sat in the flight attendant jump seat and she sort of sat on the very edge of the same jump seat and held the wall for take off and landing they also kept the curtains closed to the front of the aircraft which in the event of an evacuation would be a nono because people couldnt see to get to the exit
16373,qantas airways,2,disgraceful and filthy travel experience,sydney to christchurch on 20th april 2023 and never have i experienced such a disgraceful and filthy travel experience as that which i along with other passengers were forced to endure during this flight flight qf137 delayed for over 1 hour flight entertainment not working throughout the journey blood or food on seatbelt clip chewing gum on back of seat second rate substandard food simply disgusting recline button on seat not working dirty floor worn and stained seat temperature control not working stuck on cold which made it uncomfortable for the entire flight dirty tray table grubby and dirty magazine luggage left in the rain on the tarmac in sydney during the delayed flight resulting most of my cloths being wet once they were retrieved in christchurch this is an international flight albeit only from sydney to christchurch this is not only reflected in the fare but the additional time required to transit through customs and security etc as a passenger i will think carefully before i choose to fly qantas again as i know that you can do better finally it saddens me to see how the high standard of service and quality that qantas was known for has been eroded to below that of ryan air clearly the plane had not been cleaned properly in a quite sometime and should never have been used for an international flight or for any flight for that matter under the qantas brand
6123,brussels airlines,9,never had any serious issues,brusselsbarcelona return i have never had any serious issues with this airline so far and i have flown several times with them outbound leg arrived with about 40 minutes delay in barcelona due to late arrival of the plane in brussels return flight was on time as always very pleasant professional and proactive crew on both flights their food and drink choices are good value as well the ticket that i bought was the cheapest on those dates
5838,bmi regional,9,a most efficient service,stansted to derry this is a most efficient service with every aspect of it being handled professionally i love being able to check a large bag in and not having staff say that it is too big too heavy etc the air stewardess on my flight was so accommodating to people who had difficulties with managing the steps and overall had a lovely disposition the planes are never overcrowded on this derry route which makes for a pleasant and comfortable flight
1783,air india,3,going from bad to worst,bad treatment took air india flt no 129 on 15th july 545 am departure what i experienced was not expected from air india after breakfast we had to ask for a cup of tea which very conveniently got over just before our front row the steward too conveniently did turn up finally i had to request staff who in turn was kind enough to provide us tea even though she was not in charge of the muddle row it didnt end here the same thing he repeated the same after the afternoon meals when i requested him he said tea is over and will get it he didnt turn up with tea till end this type of treatment is not expected from air india it is also very strange that we in the middle row is served meals at the end by this time the both the other rows are almost done with their meals air india is going from bad to worst no value for money ai is not charging anything less than other airlines then why such nasty treatment to their own countrymen
20374,thomas cook airlines,8,a bargain and the flight was fine,boston to manchester with a scheduled departure time of 1735 with an arrival time of 0455 the next morning i checked on the punctuality of this route and found that the plane often took off about 15 minutes early but almost always arrived on time or a bit earlier that was the case with my flight cabin baggage in economy is limited to 6 kg my carry on bag was easily 15 kg but since i was not checking a bag i figured that once i checked in i would simply print my boarding pass and go directly to the gate i know logan airport well and there are no scales at the gates but i was wrong it is impossible to print a boarding pass from home everyone must go to the check in counter because of this i had to check in one bag and make sure that my carry on was under 6 kg i also put my laptop in another small bag which the check in person didnt see once my bag was weighted no one ever questioned it or inspected it i could have had a friend waiting for me and simply stuffed my bag after checking in or simply left my bag with my friend and arrived with no bag whatsoever so beware you must be careful as they weigh all carry on bags at boston the flight was fine free meal chicken or beef and free muffin and coffee before landing everything else costs money cans of beer were 4gbp no individual screens on the seat backs just drop down screens like in the 1970s no problem seats were a bit tight but otherwise fine staff was lovely for 139gbp one way from boston to the uk it was a bargain great deal and i would fly them again just bring a book or some thing to keep you occupied bring a bottle of water i would fly them again because its a bargain and the flight was fine

13550,latam airlines,2,no respect for their customers,latam is fine as long as there are no issues our flight got cancelled due to maintenance issues and thats when the trouble started latam personnel is constantly contradicting itself and providing wrong information they are badly organised in case of a calamity such as a cancellation which causes long and unnecessary waiting times for their costumers under stressful conditions the company does not give the compensation that it is legally required to provide the personnel does not seem to care about their customers simply no respect for their customers

11221,iberia,8,fabulous crew on board,excellent velazquez lounge in madrid with real meal very quick boarding and fabulous crew on board covid precautions well enforced 3 points might be improved entertainment system is outdated with an extremely limited choice of movies as well as poor flight tracking seat cushion is much too hard and access to baggage compartment is nearly impossible too high
11022,hong kong airlines,5,flight was punctual,manila to vancouver via hong kong the first leg from manila was philippine airlines our layover was only 2 hrs but we had to line up for an hour in hkg to get our connecting boarding passes prior to the flight i had checked in online already and saved the bar codes in my phone however according to the staff these were not allowed and printed copies were required they should have at least noted that online during boarding they did not prioritize families with children inflight entertainment is limited to movies and music inflight food is not nourishing for me the cabin crew are very accommodating and helpful flight was punctual as expected
21741,vietnam airlines,4,we were not impressed,hanoi to osaka kansai first time to fly vietnam airlines and we were not impressed the food in economy was terrible crew did their bare minimum and we could see them sleeping in their crew seats during take off and landing also the plane wasnt cleaned properly crumbs and wrappers on the floor the good thing was the ife which was very user friendly and quite a few selections

5032,avianca,4,very budget affair overall,aviancas controversial race to the low fares bottom has also taken a hit on business class no dedicated check in or boarding for business class in bogot complete rudeborderingon indifference from gate staff when i innocently asked why not onboard no pre flight drinks or nibbles for business and other than dinner and mediocre breakfast staff just hid away all flight with no drinks or even water small touches that cost nothing but leave a mark when absent entertainment had limited films and tv no music channels very budget affair overall i was on miles but for high paying pax it makes no sense to cut back on premium classes even if economy is all low fares would rather take longer with better product eg on iberia

6203,brussels airlines,2,lost me as client for sure,vilnius to brussels traveled on fastflex economy not first time and really was surprised that since now everything drinks snacks are for purchase as no any service except fast track option price available tickets vnobru price was double that for lower economy class in my opinion no more any value to buy this class tickets few weeks ago i used sasplus economy and i got food beverages and even access to business lounge at airport for free so brussels airlines lost me as client for sure
17207,rwandair,7,aircraft very well maintained,aircraft very well maintained terrible to make transit transfers in dxb had to struggle in the middle of the night with busses from t1 to t2 where there is always check in chaos and no signage nor separation of airlines had to insist on lounge access as the checkin counters could not care less about passengers was granted access to a sub par lounge in t2 called marhaba the bar sections was for smokers also so air was hazy poor boarding services at gate on time but then shuttled around by bus for ages after waiting in the bus for 20 minutes before it took off onboard nice atmosphere great decoration of business cabin great fas and good good caring however no menu cards nor drink list sparse supply food acceptable and plenty ife worked well seats very nice and spacious i slept well got dinner at night and got a full breakfast from mombasa to kigali good airline though not attached to any alliance ticket not cheap otherwise could have rated 810

18230,singapore airlines,5,worst business class seats,worst business class seats why does sq still have business class seats where the place to put your feet is not in line with the rest of your body and the transition from bed to sitting is not a button push rather get out of seat flip seat with handles get back into seatbed

9172,eva air,5,a horrible flight for me,taipei to san francisco my flight was on august 18 2022 on br 18 from taipei to san francisco i have a condition called oab over active bladder and thats why i always wanted to sit near the lavatory because i always have to empty my bladder every 30 mins on that flight i was on 73h last row aisle sit right side and behind me was the lavatory since i got into the plane i rushed to the lavatory behind my seat and it was occupied i waited for 15 mins and a flight crew approached me and told me to just use the lavatory on the other side and that was fine with me since it was vacant but mid flight i noticed every time i went to that lavatory it was always occupied and i was forced to use the left side lavatory or on the lavatory on the middle part of the plane but one time i caught a flight crew came out on that lavatory behind me and as soon as she came out she suddenly locked the lavatory from outside and make it appear that it was occupied but nobody was using it and the reason they are locking it from outside so that nobody can use that lavatory except for them crew it was a horrible flight for me because i badly need to use a lavatory to empty my bladder i have one behind me but that crew on that flight are using it exclusively so i have to use the other side but it always had a long line or the lavatory on the middle part of the plane which is too far from my seat
7417,condor airlines,5,inflight staff are the shining light,overall an ok experience the outbound flight was delayed by 3 hours due to an instrument light that needed a physical signoff by a technician that was 2 hours away if this was an isolated event that would be one thing but reading numerous reviews before booking my flight it sounds like this happens quite frequently shame on me i guess the condor 767s are rather old from my understanding 28 years on average so it seems like this problem could be better planned for this delay caused me to miss my connecting flight with lufthansa which was a whole other ordeal in and of itself the return flight was uneventful thankfully the only issue was that my digital boarding pass listed an incorrect seat i specifically paid for an aisle seat with premium entertainment so that caused me to feel pretty anxious when i got to the gate in frankfurt i asked the desk agent about my digital pass only to have him largely ignore me he then printed a new boarding pass that had my correct seat what this was about i dont know the cabins arent bad seats are ok and the inflight staff are the shining light for this airline they were polite and attentive and i appreciated their help

13200,kuwait airways,3,forgot my luggage in kuwait,new york to delhi via kuwait water bottle not provided in the flight so every time you want to drink water you have to call the flight attendant and she will bring a small glass of water for you flight delayed 15 hr and second time it delayed 12 hr they forgot my luggage in kuwait though it had a tag of delhi they are not picking my call vegetarian food is not available you have to give special order for vegetarian food mostly food was halal and pork free too much of crowd if you are travelling in economic class you have to be in a long queue for every checkin boarding blanket will be provided to those who ask for it it was wifi equipped but paid so i dont know how was the speed for entertainment it had decent number of nice movies movies in english islamic hindi but subtitles available only is arabic announcement were mainly in arabic and english
16042,phuket air,2,phuket air customer review,we flew with phuket air in january but have only just found this site we must agree with all comments made about this airline our outward flight scheduled for 200 pm on 18 january was delayed until 700 am on 19 january the aircraft was very cold for the whole journey lots of people sitting with blankets around them the cabin crew were trying to keep the toilets clean but were not very effective the in flight service was not of a good standard and we were left for many hours with no food at all on asking about this we were given a tuna roll our return journey which should have left of 29 january at 1150 pm was delayed until 1245 pm on the following day before we left sharjah after refuelling the engines on the right hand side of the aircraft were under observation on take off and periodically throughout the rest of the journey we found this rather worrying more so now after the events of the last few weeks our travel insurance company rejected our claim for the return delay because the wording of the airlines letter stated the reason for the delay was aircraft rotation and this is not covered under our policy we arrived back at gatwick at 830 pm on sunday and were unable to use our return rail ticket and our son had to make a 400 mile round trip to collect us we were left considerably out of pocket we feel that the comments in the press from the airline representative over the fuel spillage incident last week patronising and indifferent to the very real fears of the passengers concerned phuket air pulling out of great britain is the best news for travellers to thailand the flight problems left us with bad memories of an otherwise very enjoyable holiday
22466,volotea,7,better than ryanair,in general volotea is a good airline every time ive flown with them everything has been correct no delays planes are comfortable and somewhat clean crew is generally polite and nice however there are downsides as in customer service this last time ive flown with them i checked in my luggage at the counter and it arrived with a bit of the zip open no one would actually give me a coherent answer to my claim i was left in the hands of automatic responses etc another time having purchased my seat i was asked to change it because they or their algorithm had seated separately a mother and a toddler i said i wouldnt change it before boarding as i had paid to my surprise a flight attendant confronted me once again onboard when all passengers had already been sat that is plain rude and once again never got a proper answer after having filled in a complaints form to sum up volotea is better than ryanair but they still need to improve many things will keep flying with them though

20348,thomas cook airlines,1,appalling customer service,dont even bother booking a thomas cook airlines flight it was the worst experience ever we paid 130 for 2x65 seat upgrades for extra legroom only to be told 30mins before boarding that they had double booked our seats and we were being moved to normal seats the only way to get a refund was to wait until getting back to uk and put in a complaint form online and wait 28 days even then after phoning them they insisted that they never received my complaint absolutely appalling customer service with no concern for its customers we will never fly again with thomas cook also on our outbound trio my inflight entertainment didnt work and it meant having no entertainment for a 10 hour flight plus when we got back to manchester our suitcase was damaged beyond repair

4897,avelo airlines,1,customer service is inadequate,if you ever have to cancel your flight they will conveniently lose your travel funds and youll never see them again i spent countless hours sending them the proof that they owed me travel funds and they just said that they couldnt find them and that it was the customers responsibility to keep track what a joke i sent everything that they had sent me how can i give them travel funds numbers to research whats owed to me if they never gave them to me in the first place customer service is inadequate and in accurate and they do not care if you are owed if they say they cannot locate your travel funds on their end it then you lose i will never ever fly avelo airlines again and if i am asked by anyone in my area how i like them i will always tell them the full story
15159,norse atlantic airways,7,seats were comfortable,first time flying norse airlines i went premium economy seats were comfortable a lot of movie choices especially on a long flight like this food choice was good friendly staff on the plane when they make announcements on the plane a little too cringy for my liking on the excessive explanation ie every time there was some sort of turbulence they would repeat the same announcements which took about 23 minutes other than that i really enjoyed the flight
13364,lan airlines,7,lan airlines customer review,santiagolima in premium economy then two internal flights in peru and limahavana all in economy all flights operated on time and the service was friendly and efficient pleasant meals and snacks were served the plane on our first sector was a bit old and tatty inside the others were all fine though the seat on the 5hr sector from lima to havana was rather tight for such a long sector checkin boarding and luggage delivery were all efficient and all flights arrived on time or early the premium economy seats are economy seats with the middle seat left empty a business class meal was served on our international premium economy sector one sour note was the way the entire crew including the captain and first officer pushed past their passengers in havana to get to the front of the immigration queue not a good look
1117,air busan,2,was a disaster,today in morning when we were coming jeju to busan it was 10 minutes late which is acceptable but after this when all the passengers were in plane and it start to run they stopped we were informed that there is an issue and pilot will take plane back we were kept waiting another few minutes and cabin manager announce that they are looking into it and will give further notice crew members were serving water and juice further notice kept happening for next two hours and plane finally moved at 1235 pm instead of 1030 am it was my first time to fly with air busan to jeju which was a disaster
13026,korean air,6,business class product is subpar,auckland to seoul i found a lot of the business class service systems of korean air quite odd whilst the crew were polite and responsive they are working within a set system that means their business class product is subpar for example your menu which includes the wine list is taken off you immediately after departure so you cannot refer back to it this makes ordering wine particularly difficult another thing is that if you order the korean meal options then you are deprived of the additional food such as a soup starter and bread that people ordering western meal options receive they are not even offered and as a result i was starving after my small bowl of rice porridge ive never been left hungry after a meal even in economy class there was no indication of what snacks were on offer luckily i was sitting next to a frequent flier and he kept ordering interesting snacks and so i followed suit on a 12 hour daytime flight during which two meals were served there were only two drink runs by the crew and they were both during the second meal service i had to constantly request a drink and at one stage even went to the galley to see what types of wine were available i really didnt like this approach to service i much rather have the drinks offered rather than have to proactively request for them however this seems to be the way they do things you wont be offered anything beyond the bare minimum but staff are happy to respond if you do request things the ife was poor a very limited selection of mainstream movies and little in the way of reading materials the seat was comfortable and the cabin was spotless including the toilets which were regularly cleaned so whilst the hard product was good and the service was polite and efficient i really felt it was a bare bones service culture and therefore i did not feel pampered or spoilt as i usually do in business class it really felt they were trying to minimise costs by keeping the food and drink away from the public eye
6206,brussels airlines,9,staff was kind attentive,copenhagen to entebbe via brussels our trip with them was amazing at the checkin counter the staff was so incredibly kind to put priority labels on all our of bags even though only one in our group of four was entitled to it a member in our group was in the need of wheel chair service and the staff was kind attentive and service minded our group was transported from gate to gate with a smile on the flight a member of our group could not eat the food they served because it contained tomatoes and shes allergic we did not inform brussels airlines about this prior to our trip so they had no way of being prepared for this however alternative food was presented by friendly and service minded staff all in all we are super happy that we chose brussels airlines and will definitely do it again
4827,austrian airlines,4,not very customer friendly,vienna to montreal it is ridiculous that in 2022 you are not able to let passengers check in with a permanent resident status in canada online it is time consuming at the airport seat cannot be selected because checkin works only at the airport and i am wasting my time at the airport because the system is not working online i called the support service and i am just told to check in at the airport very frustrating and not very customer friendly
5083,azerbaijan airlines,7,seats and leg space were very good,first time to fly azerbaijan airlines on a short break from dubai to baku a319 and a320 aircraft were used both planes were a bit older and looked tired however seats and leg space were very good no entertainment only the overhead screens which was showing some programs but yet couldnt used earphones as nothing can be heard from the audio set food was on the good side not the best quality but nice for 3 hrs flight the crew were very friendly and helpful both flights left on time and arrived earlier than scheduled overall a good experience especially with a very good price as well
13310,lan airlines,2,would not use again,brisbane to lima via santiago i would not use this airline again we flew from brisbane to lima and experienced confusion at santiago as we waited for flight to lima no one really knew what was happening and we changed gates many times when we were in santiago we realised we had a problem with one of our flights we could not go from lima to rio as we did not have a visa for brazil so we went to lan offices and asked for some help to change the flight we were told this was not possible even though we were prepared to pay extra money to avoid losing our connecting flight from santiago back to brisbane in fact we heard for the first time that if we didnt get on the flight to rio all our ongoing flights would be cancelled catch 22 as we couldnt go to rio as we didnt have a visa and we couldnt not go as we still wanted to return to brisbane lan offered us no help at all and were totally useless at a time when we were in a country where we needed some help we ended up booking flights with delta to fly back to brisbane moral is always fly with a decent airline it is worth the extra cost
8733,emirates,2,needed to request accommodation in advance,i landed in dubai on the 27th jan in transit to perth with a 19hrs layover when i inquired about accommodation i was told by emirates staff that they could not help because i did not book it in advance at no point during the booking i was notified i needed to request accommodation in advance i had to spend 19 hours at the airport because i did not have any cash to book a hotel at my expense will definitely think twice before flying emirates again
7605,corsair,6,overall good experience,paris orly to pointepitre overall good experience decent food friendly service on the inbound flight outbound all of the crew disappeared at night difficult to get something to drink some security concerns upon landing in paris crew didnt check the cabin at alltwo teens sleeping in lie flat position until touchdown no one to wake them up no one to remind them to put their seat in an upright position never saw that before seats are ok but angled lie flat
9557,firefly,5,firefly customer review,i have just returned from a trip to alor star aor from subang szb and it was a very pleasant flight with fy flights took off on time and the crew were friendly and genuine overall excellent trip with fy i wish they flew into kul as well for easier connections to other points
15667,openskies,3,openskies customer review,travelling parisnewark in october and i fear im about to be very disappointed a pity because ive flown this route with openskies in the past and had good service a phone call today informed me that my flight has been cancelled with three options available leave the previous day impossible as connecting flights are built around this one fly ba through london nondirect flight that adds 35 hours to an already long trip i chose os to avoid this sort of thing or refund the customer service agent was courteous but had no explanation other than operational issues 3 months out my answers to the other rating questions in this review would be it depends on the outcome of the current situation but that option is not available
13999,lot polish airlines,1,it was relatively cheap,most convenient connection between the two citiesas i needed to go from bydgoszcz to warsaw in certain time frame i found this connection to be more convenient than railway as it was way shorter but only small bit more expensive but for time concious people like me it was best connection between two towns as bydgoszcz is a small airport we boarded by stairs and had to walk only a small bit to the aircraft but weather was not bad so it was not an issue again as on every lot flight as we enter we get a sanitizing wipes which was good the flight was very short under 40 mins the cabin crew did a very good job providing complimentary pastry and cup of water in my opinion one of the best lot domestic connection as it was relatively cheap and the good service despite very short flight but makes it very fast journey between cities would highly recommend anyone traveling between bydgoszcz and warsaw to consider this connection
22016,vistara,3,avoid booking their b737,bad experience booked for premium economy and at the last moment they changed to economy with excuse that aircraft has been changed and no premium economy in that aircraft also during call they said that now we have window and middle seats in mid row but at the last moment when we were doing web checking come to know that we both were given middle seats so certainly on different rows the app is pathetic tried many times to change but unsuccessful finally was able to do using laptop call centre is another bad experience too long waiting time also didnt get any confirmation mail about change from premium economy to economy only refund was done on time even the aircraft was too cramped very small leg space with respect to other vistara aircraft just like any lcc whereas vistara is a full fledged carrier my suggestion is to avoid booking their b737 their a320321 are good food was ok for such a short route which was just 1 hour 30 min
7564,corendon airlines,1,do not youve been warned,bad service and ripoff first please note that when flying corendon everything thinkable will be charged surplus not doing online self checkin will cost an extra 10eur pp any additional luggage other than cabinluggage is charged surplus 1x20kg 60eur a coffee inflight would have cost me 3 eur surplus further the flightinformation was not understandable but at least deafening conclusion do not youve been warned
15093,nok air,5,worn out seat dirty windows,i booked with nok air online for my business trip from bangkok dmk to chumphon cjm tax certificate can be easily requested online and delivered to my office even before my journey their website is user friendly and i selected my preferred seat well in advance on departure i was informed that flight would be 50 minutes delayed with no further explanation the aircraft was a 3 years old dash 8 q400 lovely livery but the sign of poor maintenance and improper cleaning are all over interior tray table cannot be used worn out seat dirty windows a small bottle of water is served free of charge by a nice cabin crew i bought a pack of snack which is nice the return flight on atr72 which is an even older aircraft i had to move to a few vacant seats before finally finding one that can be kept upright all in all the experience is fair but i would prefer to fly other airlines if possible
17073,royal jordanian airlines,2,fees for everything,worst airline ever with their customer service fees for everything it was about 1000 fees to be able to just change the flight day because i had an emergency case to travel earlier and no convenient option for cancelling at all no full refund and not even a credit option the only option was to leave the ticket on hold for a fee of 270 this is ridiculous and waste of money with all the extra fees another cheaper flight can be purchased its the last time for me to travel with this airline
21576,uzbekistan airways,3,uncomfortable sleepless night flight,we flew to tashkent on 11 october 2016 from london this was a night flight of 75 hours and we wanted to sleep but it was not to be this was an ancient plane whose business class seats reclined only a few degrees it was 2x2 seating did not taste the food as wanted to sleep tablets with pre loaded entertainment was offered i dont understand why such ancient planes are used on such a route they have boeing 787 but these are not thought to be worthy of this route the washrooms were sparsely equipped a very uncomfortable sleepless night flight
8060,dragonair,8,disappointed with inflight meal,kota kinabalu to hong kong it was a pleasant experience flying on the second day of chinese new year flight ka060 was delayed until 1500 from the original schedule departure 1200 due to unforeseen circumstances i was not able to make my flight connection to beijing i was delighted that a notify sms was sent to my mobile informing of such delay another notification was sent from bki based ground staff to further confirm such i arrived the airport earlier with the hope that i will be able to get a replacement flight to beijing seemingly that it was indeed risky for me to get a connecting flight from hkg to pek on 1830 they offered me the option of next day departure which i agreed upon travelling was made easier as a confirmed seat and boarding pass for cx390 was also issued at the same time similarly hotel was also arranged for me upon boarding flight ka060 i was assisted by the cabin crew to my seat a apology was also made prior to departure informing the reason behind such delay i am impressed with the professionalism of the flight attendants in flight meal was promptly served after airborne i had been flying cathay dragon since 2014 nonetheless i am slightly disappointed with the inflight meal the portion has now been resized to smaller portion since 2016 in the last 12 months i had also flown with other airline in this region asiana airlines still serve dessert and metal cutlery which cathay dragon now longer provide
16545,qatar airways,2,made me feel unwelcome,staff were unfriendly did not smile and made me feel unwelcome during service it looked unorganised and on our second flight it took 25hrs before a drink or meal was offered received a meal and saying thank you to the hostess who did not even acknowledge it d0 not understand how they say the tomato juice is finished 2hrs into the 9hrs flight and they need to go see if business class has on our last flight they loaded us into a bus for departure in doha we had to stand in it for 30min at the gate before it moved anywhere and to top it off we had to board a hot plane sitting for 30min before taxing and any form of cold air
18285,singapore airlines,5,a very average experience,was this a memorable flight not really i like the entertainment selection the seat was fine for just over a 2 hr flight on sq177 actually not much different to the 350900 medium haul except maybe the adjoining two seats in the middle are closer the food oh my dreadful sounded great lemongrass chicken it was very fatty and unpleasant the bok choy was almost raw i would have preferred a plateful of the garlic bread instead of the tiny slice i was given all in all it was a very average experience i miss the singapore airlines pre covid and really think they need to up their game in the food area especially i booked this flight as at the time it was actually cheaper to go to hcmc via singapore than just to singapore however i wish i booked through vietnam airlines and saved money and connection hassles
14149,lufthansa,1,they refuse to refund the hotel,on december 16th i was supposed to fly from hamburg to brussels there was a strike so at the airport they rerouted me over munich on a flight not affected by the strike no problem it happens my flight to munich unfortunately left with delay so i missed the connection in munich and then it started since it was already late the lufthansa staff in munich to just organize your own hotel and they would provide a refund after which they just closed the office now they refuse to refund the hotel avoid this airline at all cost if you miss your flight they leave you stranded with no assistance at all
13174,kuwait airways,7,i was pleasantly surprised,bangalore to london via kuwait having read poor reviews i was pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort of the planes and the good service both flights were punctual enough and baggage delivery was speedy almost my best experience of flight from india to a hub airport
20944,tui airways,4,delivering a way below par service,delayed take off no issue with this flying from a skiing trip you do expect the weather to possibly delay things on arrival at manchester it took 1 hour 25 minutes for the cases to filter through from the aircraft to the luggage belt no explanation no staff around to ask incredibly frustrating a 98 minute flight took over 10 hours including the time from resort 3 pick ups delays in take off and delays with luggage handlers very poor tui manchester is an international airport but sadly your ground crew delivering a way below par service
19510,swoop,3,none of them checked my hand luggage,i have a complaint to report the reason for writing is to expose my discomfort from a very bad experience i had in the service in this airline i have traveled for work reasons on june 9 2022 from toronto to halifax and when i got to the area where the staff checks the luggage a young guy told me that the luggage of my suitcase that i had paid for was fine but in the carryon bag that i had with me i had a 156inch laptop he made me pay 6780 for it thats more than the cost of my baggage of several kilos of weight you should have more control of your staff thats why im leaving my review here and i believe that those people like me will never again travel on your airline including that i already asked my family and friends because these experiences are discussed at family gatherings and social it is very uncomfortable and annoying that your review staff does this with consumers because you owe it to the consumer and with these actions many people move away and avoid traveling on your airline again then i traveled 3 more times between halifax and toronto on other airlines and none of them even checked my hand luggage much less charged me a cost for said bag if it passes the formal airport review its fine but we are not charged extra by travel agencies guide your staff better or renew them constantly because it seems that they are not happy doing their job rb
3978,alitalia,5,very old entertainment system,flew back to brazil in alitalia business class short hop from lhr to fco was nice all good lounge at rome is as good as any in the world simply because its food is great the longhaul flight back to gru was same type of aircraft as the outbound and similarly tired very old entertainment system even in business class i do like alitalias flat bed seat i do find it very comfortable food was not up to scratch the menu was quite limited and uninspiring for premium cabin campari was great as always the pasta was a little burned the fish was tiny and of poor quality i was very disappointed as i have always raved about alitalias food the flight was very uncomfortable as there was a lot of turbulence i was unable to sleep at all i felt the pilot could have done more he cruised at the same altitude for from the third hour of the flight when in my experience others have tried to look for more comfortable reaches maybe there were atc considerations i dont know but it was a pretty horrid flight and i did feel a lack of consideration from the front
2132,air malawi,6,a very pleasant airline that tries hard,a very pleasant airline that tries hard despite being the national carrier of a very poor country with only 3 planes the service on the 737 is equal to saa the domestic flight on a cessna caravan between blantyre and club mak was perhaps the most fun flight i have ever undertaken the pilot flew low so we could look at the scenery and even made several detours to look at herds of elephants and hippos service on this flight was understandably limited to a help yourself cooler filled with soft drinks but too busy looking out the windows anyway
68,adria airways,5,adria airways customer review,i fly adria a lot at least once a month and find them ok the service is mixed often the supervisor is not ready for boarding and there is noone to greet last time when i boarded the crew were having their photo taken on the tarmac so we all had to stand and wait until they finished food is fine and the hand luggage service where it is delivered on the tarmac on landing works well on the crj aircraft
133,aegean airlines,1,one of the best airline apps i have tried so far,great airline i fly regularly with aegean airlines and it is always my number one choice especially the new planes are really nice and the service on board is good too the food is really not that bad especially in business class however economy is great as well there are some nice touches with aegean like how they inform you when your flight is delayed they email you and you get a notification in the app about the app it works really good one of the best airline apps i have tried so far i dont have any complaints even after dozens of flights no problems at all
12125,jet2com,6,jet2 is perfectly decent,leeds bradford to thessaloniki for the most part this airline is fine both the outbound and return flights took off an hour late not the longest of delays but a bit annoying the pilots made up a chunk of time on the return and we arrived only 25 mins after the scheduled time i guess the swift turnaround helped to explain the lack of cleaning always a bit disconcerting to open ones tray table to find the spill marks of a previous passengers drink see pic same plane for both journeys a 27 yearold 737300 however it had been retrofitted including winglets and the interior looked very new apart from it being a little noisy the planes age was no issue the seats were interesting plastic with minimal cushioning see pic they didnt lean back a good thing and had tiny armrests a bad thing i suppose it allows the airline to fit more in without reducing legroom they were comfy enough for the first couple of hours but as we approached the third hour the lack of cushioning started to tell the plastic felt sticky avoid wearing shorts the legroom was perfectly fine for short haul this is the first flight ive taken on which there were no window blinds or dimmers a real curiosity and i cant think why they would be absent it made the outbound journey uncomfortable until i fashioned a blind of my own using a sweatshirt until then the sun was pretty blinding and hot as a budget product jet2 is perfectly decent booking easy online checkin and printing of boarding passes easy no ife but none was expected didnt bother ordering food but the menu items were predictably overpriced didnt pay for checkedin baggage as the 10kg allowance for hand luggage was enough for my short trip well done for this in particular jet2 the staff were fine efficient and friendly enough without being overbearing i felt a bit sorry for them to be honest having to spend much of their time trying to sell stuff i guess its the necessary economy of the budget airline i didnt like the fact that they prohibited the drinking of ones own alcoholic beverages and only allowed us to consume those bought on board i appreciate theres a security aspect being able to refuse extra drinks to very drunk people but i suspect theres a profitbased motivation too naturally when the crew announced you shouldnt drink your own alcoholic drinks i understood it as you shouldnt get caught drinking your own alcoholic drinks i was very discreet
7160,citilink,7,flight attendants were friendly,i flew from jakarta to semarang on citilink it was a flight near the end of the ramadhan season so its packed since most of the passengers are traveling to their hometowns to celebrate lebaran with their families and relatives the flight was the first flight of citilink in hlp which was scheduled to depart at 515 i was notified by citilink to be at the airport 3 hours prior to the scheduled departure to avoid long lines at the airport which is a bit upsetting since i have to be at the airport by 215 only to find the flight itself was delayed for about an hour due to operational reason aside from that the trip was pretty good the ground staff were quick but a little more smiling could be better the flight attendants were friendly informative and helpful the cabin was clean and comfortable overall citilink is pretty good and i will fly with them in the future as long as they improve especially in the ground handling and the punctuality of their schedules
18629,solomon airlines,6,solomon airlines customer review,bnehirbne bne connection is operated by strategic airlines service bnehirbne excellent like a party on board with plenty of food and endless drinks luggage allowance flexible punctuality quite good domestic no service on board had only one cancellation due to puncture on remote island of gizo however hotel and care quickly provided until next morning small aircraft on domestic routes noisy

535,aeromexico,2,terrible and dysfunctional airline,just such a terrible and dysfunctional airline starting with customer service the app is terrible service has no interest in being of service business class is nothing of the sort stay away
17310,ryanair,7,very good service with lots of smile,return flight zagagpzag in mid march 2023 booking flights on the ryanair app is easy and straightforward very reasonably priced tickets are bought 2 months in advance flights from zag are operated by lauda europe and their a320 in 180 seat config boarding was on time with a bit of queuing the young and very enthusiastic crew offered very good service with lots of smiles both flights were on time onboard products are reasonably priced had just enough leg space i was not touching the seat in front no frills but flights were definitely very good value for money
13276,lan airlines,7,seats are too narrow,sydney santiago via auckland on 7879 above average flight with an average meal very good crew and reasonable ife selection however the 9 abreast in economy is too tight the seats are too narrow and the aisles are tiny the meal trolley only just fits through the tray table is also very small on the return leg a passenger fell ill immediately after takeoff the crew managed this very well about 2 hours into the flight it was determined that wed have to return to scl the airline put us into hotels as a transit passenger through scl the airline arranged to pay our reciprocity fee us100 to enter into chile this was a long process over 1 hour but at least they paid for it the airline wasnt able to arrange a single large bus to take us to the hotel at the last minute and so there was another long process about 15 hours of getting all of us into separate mini buses the hotel was excellent and included free food back to the airport this time in a big coach and a very long checkin process our bags were checked through to syd and we were advised wed been put onto a qantas flight from akl to syd the flight was again reasonable good crew ok food definitely not up to emirates standards and bathrooms kept clean due to our delayed arrival into akl we had to overnight there and again lan had arranged a hotel meal and bus transfer for us overall lan managed this stressful situation which was out of their control quite well ensuring we had a place to rest and food to eat and made sure we all got to our final destinations my lower marks are for the standard and quantity of the food and the cramped seating that almost all operators of the 787 have adopted
9479,finnair,3,delayed but they didnt inform us,the airline staff in germany is very nice and helpful the flight was smooth and the food was good but the flight back to germany from bangkok is not ok the staff at bangkok suvarnabhumi airport are so not helpful and complaining about our heavy luggage in thai i am thai but my husband is german i could understand what they talked the flight was delayed but they didnt inform us the app from finnair was not updated for this delayed information the staff were busy charging us more money for our luggage all in all we would consider to take finnair again if there are no other options
5709,blue islands,4,sold its soul to the devil,guernsey to southampton such a huge disappointment that what used to be a great little channel island based airline has now merged with flybe a route that was already relatively expensive for the air miles travelled has now become excessive due to the unreasonable way that flybe charge for absolutely every aspect of your booking including booking seats how else do they propose we travel in an aeroplane and taking luggage this has greatly increased the ticket prices on a recent review of tickets for later in 2017 i found this to have worked out at approximately 100 increase roughly a third increase which i think is disgraceful what used to be a small customer focused company appears to have sold its soul to the devil and been swallowed up by the greedy big boys and i will have to think twice about who we fly with in future such a shame as i always chose blue islands previously for so many positive reasons
3633,aircalin,9,surprisingly very good,melbourne to nouma surprisingly very good airline and good business seat for a three hours flight very good staff and very good product in business among them nikko japanese whisky
12629,jetstar pacific,5,jetstar pacific customer review,sgndadsgn check in on both legs quick and easy boarding a little chaotic but no more so than most cheap asia flights extremely old and dirty boeing 737400 both flights left and arrived pretty much to time and crew were polite and friendly the general feel of aircraft was old worn out and dirty which does not give you a good feeling overall the flight was very good value for money however i would not choose to fly with jetstar again due to the state of the aircraft
17799,seaborne airlines,1,disgusted by the treatment,st thomas to st croix i have nothing good to say about seaborne airlines at this moment i traveled from st martin to st thomas today via air sunshine and i had bought a oneway ticket from seaborne in advance to travel from st thomas downtown to st croix downtown which was my ultimately destination the oneway ticket on seaborne cost 8900 due to inclement weather in st maarten my flight left very late and i arrived on st thomas at about 1125 am my seaborne flight from st thomas downtown was scheduled to leave at 1210 pm unfortunately i had to go through customs at st thomas airport and by the time a took a taxi to the seaplane location on the waterfront the time was 1150 am when i arrived at seaborne i was informed that my flight had already been closed and that i would be put on standby for the flight leaving at at 240 pm i was then informed that i would have to pay an additional fee of 7500 to get on the 240 pm flight i came back at 140 pm and was informed that there were seats available on the 240 pm flight and i took out my credit card to pay the 7500 fee and i was then informed by the attendant at the counter that there was an additional 4000 charge above and beyond the 7500 that was already being charged for a ticket that i bought for 8900 so the total cost for a oneway ticket from st thomas to st croix would have been 20400 absolutely disgusted by the treatment that i got i refused to buy the ticket and got home via the qeiv fast ferry for 5000
3106,air zimbabwe,1,air zimbabwe customer review,i was on my flight back from london there is never any inflight entertainment on your long haul journeys and yet they is a projector onboard very disappointing one of the flight attendants back chats when i ask for a refreshment because i could not sleep he tells me sir do you know it is four in the morning it is not good to arrive at the airport and get told that the aircraft has to stop over in lusaka to refuel
7594,corendon airlines,6,corendon airlines customer review,nueayt charter in november14 very nice flight altogether charter flight but the last one of the season so plane almost empty cabin crew fairly relaxed and joking around a bit plane seemed in good condition and clean overhead lcd displays every few rows with basic entertainment enough for the 3 hr flight the cheese roll snack was absolutely inedible but i did not mind plenty of free drinks which were served multiple times by the crew
21908,virgin australia,4,virgin needs to catch up with the rest of the companies,the flight was alright but the airplane was very outdated other airlines have tv screens and usb charging ports at every chair no matter economy or business other airlines also offer a free meal during your flight virgin needs to catch up with the rest of the companies also the wifi connection was terrible and kept dropping out

22031,vistara,6,disappointed with vistaras inflight food,extremely disappointed with vistaras inflight food expected better from a full service carrier than to be served a baked roll and a bottle of water my prior journey was with an lcc where i purchased a hot meal and a refreshing beverage
5317,bangkok airways,8,it was a great flight,i flew on an extremely early morning flight with this airline and i was in for a pleasant surprise albeit the short distance and flight time the flight attendants provided courteous service and there was even a breakfast meal it was quite nice i think the meal consisted of a sausage eggs and some vegetables checkin and baggage drop was done via a self kiosk and it was seamless at arrival my checked bags was dispensed in no time everything from start to finish was effortless and it was a great flight
16826,rossiya airlines,4,an underwhelming experience,moscow to petropavlovsk needing to go to kamchatka for work i decided to pay for business class as i didnt fancy the 8hour flight from moscow in economy nominally part of aeroflot rossiya airlines is nevertheless far from an equal to its mother company and i was disappointed when i realised that the flight was operated by ra as i have come to esteem aeroflot on longhaul routes in both business and economy online check in was easy and baggage drop was handled at berlin tegel by utair who flew me the first leg on arrival at moscows vnukovo airport i went to the pretty decent rossiya airlines lounge where i used the wireless had a coffee and ate some fruit before going to board business class passengers both of us had a small shuttle to the plane which allowed us at least to skip the crowded main bus the plane itself was freshly painted with a gorgeous mural of an amur leopards face plastered over the nose which looked amazing inside however the cabin was quite aged but the welcome was warm one stewardess spoke english well and i was glad that the business cabin was empty the stewardess informed me that the entire planes entertainment system was not working as if she was letting me know that one of the meal options was unavailable she seemed totally unbothered by this and while of course i was prepared with my laptop and a bunch of series this seemed really poor and i would have been furious had i be flying west and wasnt intending to sleep a meal was served promptly after take off salmon rice and vegetables salad and a dessert that was of the standard youd expect on a medium quality european airlines economy section and then i went to sleep the business seats recline fairly well to around 80 and were fairly comfortable meaning i got at least 6 hours of shut eye which was the main point of flying business a meaty breakfast and undrinkable coffee were served over the volcanoes of kamchatka the following morning before touching down in petropavlovsk definitely an underwhelming experience next time i will try to ensure i fly with aeroflot proper rather than one of its subsidiaries but overall i got what i paid for
17271,ryanair,7,punctual reliable service,ryanair provided a very punctual reliable service follow the rules and there are no problems friendly crew my only concern was the steep stairs down to the boarding area at stansted airport and no help for the elderly passengers
9375,fiji airways,3,the service is slow,indifference is how i would describe my experience i had a full fare business class ticket flying from sydney to nadi on the qantas code share you cant check in at qantas even with a qantas flight number and at the fiji air checkin no one was at the business class checkin although there was someone at the service desk next to it but she just ignored the business class line after 15 minutes of no action i asked her if we were wasting our time in the business class line and she said we should get on the economy line so you pay this extra money and get nothing onboard and generally the staff are friendly but the service is slow almost an hour into the flight before drinks are offered the a330 is definitely better than the 737 but most flights are on the 737 in which case i prefer virgin for service at least in business the downside is virgin offers no lounge in nadi qantas should think twice about putting its name to this service because i expect a certain standard when i buy qantas and you dont get it on fiji airways
16037,philippine airlines,4,booked the wrong flight by accident,i booked the wrong flight by accident within one day i notified them of my mistake i asked for 2 options 1 reschedule and get the difference back 2 cancel and book again with pal both werent going to be possible if the price difference was in my favour i would not get any money back customer service is bad and not flexible at all now i have to pay 2000 pesos because i want a refund i will never fly with pal again not flexible at all
14176,lufthansa,5,service is now worse than budget carriers,service is now worse than budget carriers a free bottle of water and a chocolate dont make up for the ridiculous fees for changing seats etc planes are clean staff are friendly but service is no better than a budget carrier and pricing is premium every opportunity to extract money is taken you cant even pick a seat at check in and when a seat is allocated the fees to change are high the app often doesnt work as it should and presents errors preventing you from making changes to bookings
5172,ba cityflyer,8,great experience with ba cityflyer,great experience with ba cityflyer from mykonos to london city seat configuration 2 x 2 comfy seats almost similar to a premium product no inflight entertainment but with a relatively short flight at just under 4 hours thats okay would be nice to have a hot meal in economy in the evening dinner was a chicken and potato salad lcy a breeze to get through immigration took less than 2 minutes and bag collection 20 and was on my way would highly recommend and hope ba operate more flights from here in the future
20698,tigerair australia,1,do not purchase the insurance,sydney to gold coast do not purchase the insurance with chubb insurance the recommended insurer by tiger i have had the worst experience after 9 months of being asked for more details receipts not efficient enough type them out send airline report again and long delays has been the worst experience and obvious that the company has been trying to avoid or find an error which has meant they do not have to pay i advice getting insurance elsewhere
8541,egyptair,4,would never recommend egyptair,cairo to london at mansoura egyptair office i paid more than 10000 egyptian pounds to change the date of my and my wifes tickets since the imminent suspension of airports because of corona virus despite saying that changing travel dates is free the staff were playing games and bargaining with customers to charge the largest amount if money initially they denied any economy seats left and asked for 23000 eg pounds per seat ie 46000 for 2 seats business class for only to change the travel date when i complained to the manager i found out that there are many economy seats and asked to pay over 10000 per ticket ie over 20000 after arguing this was reduced to 10056 egyptian pounds which i had no choice but to pay this is illegal since the closure of the airports was the government decision and not a mind change this is giving the company and the country bad name i come across tens of angry passengers who would never recommend egyptair to anyone this is sad situation at a time other companies are helping their passengers
12242,jetblue airways,1,will never use this airline again,i originally booked a 9 am jet blue b6340 departure jacksonville fl that i would arrive in ny well ahead of the drive rush hour to ct some 39 miles away jb changed my flight to a 1230 flight that got me to ny at 245 middle of the rush hour 3 hour drive in heavy traffic to ct return flight june 7 flight 2339 flight delayed 3 12 hours as they used our aircraft for a fully booked flight to tampa our jacksonville flight was about 60 populated the cabin crew or dispatcher or whomever is responsible for catering the aircraft failed to notify the caterer of the new time gate etc whatever is needed for the caterer to know where to meet the aircraft many passengers were aware of the aircraft switch off and voiced their disapproval of this move i heard many folks like myself resolve to never fly jet blue again the crew did a very nice job of taking care of us however they could not offer hit coffee or tea as the plane was not catered jet blue offered us a 50 credit which is nonuse to me as i will never use this airline again this is the third time jb has botched my flights from or to ny where i travel on a monthly basis on one jb flight that was cancelled i booked a delta flight home from jfk after getting a cab from lga so i would not have to wait 36 hrs for a connecting flight thru boston to get home to jacksonville flying jet blue this cost me 559 no more jet blue they really do not manage the company as though they care about the passenger
18567,smartwings,5,isnt a very good airline,rhodes to bratislava it was normal night flight the plane was quite old and dirty we had a delay about 1 and half hour smartwings isnt a very good airline but this flight was good i had very bad another flight with smartwings before we get tea water or juice and sandwich
18080,silkair,6,silkair comes up short,singapore to coimbatore return checkin was efficient but the staff member was rather haughty in her dealings with us until she discovered our class of travel a family travelling in economy class was rudely turned away from the business class line leaving a bad impression the silverkris lounge in terminal 3 was comfortable but unimpressive though the staff were excellent sincjb flight was in silkairs newest boeing 737800 9vmgq and the flight back was in their oldest one 9vmga the former was in a very good condition but the latter despite being less than three years old had many scuffs throughout the cabin the service was not quite as polished as on singapore airlines though this was because of the constraints of the hard product the cabin crew were friendly and attentive always ready to attend to the passengers while remaining unobtrusive meal service with a welcome drink and light snack before a threecourse meal later in the flight the meals were not as extravagant as those served by other airlines in business class but were sufficient i appreciated the small touches such as the festive cookies served with the snack and chocolates served after the main meal the superb cabin crew were let down by the poor product the seat though spacious had manual controls which seized up frequently my seat 2a did not recline at all a tablet an ipad on the outbound flight to cjb and a lenovo on the return leg was provided together with a pair of disposable earphones to access silkairs wireless ife but the selection was paltry and the audio was drowned out by the ambient noise furthermore the lack of a tablet holder made using the ife system for prolonged periods difficult with a price of almost sgd 2500 return per traveller and given that several other airlines in the region such as dragonair qatar airways and malindo air have superior product and service onboard similar aircraft silkair comes up short
14433,malaysia airlines,3,i will be flying qantasemirates next time,i have flown business class with many airlines over the years and malaysian airlines wins the prize for the overall worst experience late departure no announcements no notice of gate changes and all this before we took off this is the only business class that has 122 seating meaning no aisle access if you are next to a window seat impossible to climb out of your flat bed seat when the stranger in the aisle seat next to you is also asleep touch screen was old and had to be hit hard to make it work meal offerings were standard same with the service i will be flying qantasemirates next time
6198,brussels airlines,4,a total ripoff,brussels airline is awful i always try to book premium economy on international flights if i am travelling for 1517 hours it has always been well worth the extra money have done so on air canada lufthansa klm and had terrific experiences brussels airlines was awful a total ripoff barely any additional legroom no amenities every other airline provides a small pack with a toothbrush eye shades etc no water despite having a water holder no blanket inedible meal surly flight attendants and they dont even provide milkcream for coffee seriously premium and a cup of lukewarm coffee after a seven hour flight and you are handed a package of powdered chemicals it was laughable they treated us as though we had paid 59 and were making a short hop flight in fact i have taken 59 discount airlines in the us and had great experiences i will never make the mistake of booking with brussels airlines again
12189,jetairfly,3,jetairfly customer review,brusselspunta canabrussels 4hours delays at brussels due works on takeoff track flight itself was good except for flight attendants bad mood a chartered italian plane
17234,rwandair,4,rwandair customer review,i had purchased a flight from nairobi to joburg in november of 2012 for a trip i took the first week of april apparently when i was trying to catch my connecting flight to kigali i was informed that my flight had changed completely and im not referring to a minor change in time but completely i guess when rwandair made the changed they forgot to put me on the new flights they had informed me that i wouldnt be able to catch my connecting flight until the following day instead they put me on another flight with a different airline i had to wait for 11 hours at the airport additionally my return flight was changed as well which included another long wait for my connecting flight i also had to change another flight because of this rwandair caused me to waste time waiting money to change my flight and sleep i dont want to punish the courteous flight attendants as they were great but i would be careful with booking with rwandair
16348,qantas airways,3,not where it previously was,the overall qantas business product is not where it previously was having taken the same flight down with virgin business it is interesting comparing the two products virgin was overall a better product qantas check in at canberra cbr could not even see dedicated business check in and used the general boarding machines qantas lounge is comfortable but no dedicated business lounge in cbr just one shared with qantas club at time of boarding they just called the flight so no priority for business or premium ff members on the plane we were only offered water prior to the flight the plane was comfortable and the seating was good the meal was good overall but we were not offered any refills or a second beverage basically the attendant seemed to be looking at herself in her phone screen over providing service following service my empty water bottle and napkin clearly was visible in the front seat pocked but was never cleaned up even though there was plenty of time on completion of the lunch service finally the bags well again no business priority the bag came out amongst all the general baggage being a premium ff the premium baggage service has been nonexistent since qantas moved to contractors
18094,silkair,5,disappointed with the service,chiang mai to singapore mi705 and was so disappointed with the service was traveling back with a group of friends and we were sitting in the last fews rows we could not get any rest on the way back because the staff were talking joking and laughing so loudly i understand at work the need to joke socialise to pass time but i think this was way too much

7611,corsair,5,seating quickly uncomfortable,paris to pointe a pitre cabin very densified i chose duo seat for more space standard seating comfort but rather quickly uncomfortable the cabin dating from 2012 is aging rather well ife old generation and not at all reactive the touch works with the nail but you have to be patient as the reactivity is bad the catering is just ok the quantities are minimalist even for the eco the taste is correct when the search for originality is totally absent the snack 2 brownies before arrival is a petty joke fr cabine trs densifie jai choisi sige en duo pour plus despace confort dassise standard mais assez rapidement inconfortable la cabine datant de 2012 vieillit plutot bien ife dancienne gnration et pas du tout ractif le tactile fonctionne avec longle mais il faut tre patient tant la ractivit est mauvaise le catering est tout juste correct les quantits sont minimalistes meme pour de lco le got est correct quand la recherche doriginalit est totalement absente la collation 2 brownies avant arrive est une blague bien mesquine

23099,yemenia,7,yemenia customer review,ruhsanaa return on time on both legs ruhshh sector was run by the customary a319 which look tired and old no ife and food was inedible shhruh sector a newer a330 was used but still no ife food on this sector was passable scrambled eggs and foul on both sectors staff ensured that security procedures were adhered to which was reassuring
20958,tui airways,6,aircraft not clean,flights outbound return very good however aircraft not clean tea coffee stains on panel in front of extra legroom seats and table holders in seats full of crumbs tables stained sticky and this was a morning flight out of manchester considering we are wearing masks and advised on hand hygiene and reducing infection risk i thought the infection prevention controls measures on this aircraft were very poor they werent much better on the return flight either
3306,airasia india,6,ground staff were well trained,flew from indore to goa on air asia check in was easy we opted for the paid front row seats and got them easily flight on time and ground staff were well trained crew on board however were very casual the inflight supervisor spent the entire time while boarding was going checking her phone and chatting with other staff flight otherwise quite okay
9709,flyadeal,1,be cautious with this airline,i booked a flight with flyadeal on june 10th from riyadh to dammam for june 21 on arrival at king khalid airport i discovered the flight scheduled for 835pm didnt exist all flights currently stop at 6pm at the airport this is at time of writing i paid for the flight with my debit card and am now waiting for a refund for a flight that never happened whether i receive my refund remains to be seen please be cautious with this airline
18270,singapore airlines,5,there was no more beer onboard,frankfurt to singapore on singapore airlines sq325 23 february 2023 1st drink service served on trays with cups of water or juice pack of mixed nuts instead of the drink trolley 1hr into a 12hr flight dinner was served when it was my turn i asked for a beer with my dinner but was told there was no more beer onboard explained staff this flight felt a lot like scoot
7297,cobalt,9,we were very surprised,london stansted to larnaca when we booked this flight with a new airline having seen an advert on social media we were slightly unsure of what to expect however we were very surprised as to the level of service on board we flew on a small planetgrand cruz aircraft which i assume cobalt are using as a stop gap the cabin crew seemed to be a joint team of small planet and cobalt crew the cabin service was first class we purchased food and drink on board and the prices were normal high street prices the food tasty fresh and inflight announcements were clear i know the airline is new but a suggestion is please can there be an inflight price list in the seat pocket even if it is a typed laminated sheet prior to the flight we were unsure about the catering on the flight and if internet was available so we sent and email and received a reply within 30 minutes i had problems when i used the online check in and again on calling the airline was friendly and professional the downside to the flight which was beyond the airlines control was the chaos caused by the ground handling at stansted airport
2655,air nostrum,7,very good and would choose them again,i flew from madrid to marseilles with air nostrum everything was what i expect from flying on a short flight i flew on a brand new crj1000 i liked the size of the plane to the bigger a319 operated by air nostrums owner iberia i also found the seats more comfortable than iberia more legroom and 2 by 2 layout rather than a three by three warning if you are claustrophobic or dont like flying in small regional jets fly iberia or iberia express but still very good and would choose them again
9680,fly540com,8,fly540com customer review,accra to kumasi in ghana with fly540africa in february whilst on a business trip in ghana i have flown low cost airlines in europe before so had pretty low expectations however i found that booking a flight was easy via their website and also staff were friendly and helpful it was a short flight so no food to comment on the seats were pretty comfortable and although i am admittedly not very tall there was a comfortable amount of leg room i would not hesitate to use fly540 africa again
18817,southwest airlines,1,delayed for over an hour on multiple flights,this airline delayed for over an hour on multiple flights this last one was apparently due to paperwork that needed to be done before we took off im not sure what kind of nonsense that is but its sounds like a complete waste of everyones time instead of getting the entire plane where we needed to go we sat at the gate for hours due to this paperwork i used to love flying southwest and now i will choose a different airline that actually cares about their passengers
10301,georgian airways,1,they are unresponsive,tibilisi to amsterdam this is one of the most shocking scummy and poor airline i have ever flown with and i travel a lot we booked flights with this airline to armenia and then we had connection with this airline on our way back to uk via amsterdam they didnt informed us about cancellation and they didnt care to apologies or even show any curtest towards their customers very unreliable changing times of their flights all the time so please if anyone buy flights with this airline always check few days before flying as an airline they are unresponsive and will refuse to pay money back for cancellation or just lie to your face about it their english is extremely poor so is russian so im not sure what other language you can communicate with this airline apart from georgian the food on the plane was disgusting and we havent received refreshments at all not talking about the water which you would think would be basic human right the entertainment on a long flights is non existent and staff does not bother on our flight back stewardess was sleeping all the way to amsterdam at the back and if anyone was trying to use toilet at the back of the plane other stewardess was barking at people and could not be more rude and annoyed with people actually being on the plane
8095,dragonair,7,dragonair customer review,convenient online check in friendly ground staff and boarded the plane within 5 min from the boarding time however only a small portion of rice with chicken and a small glass of orange juice were served the flight attendents were robotic and were not seen except when serving meals
6399,cape air,4,cape air customer review,sjueissju san juan to tortola on a cesna 402 this is really a great flight lots of great island views in the cesna you see all the virgin islands on your approach to the bvi i put on my ipod cranked up the bob marley and enjoyed the flight
1492,air dolomiti,6,entitled to the same standard of treatment,the very short flight was decent the aircraft clean when embarking there was a female member of the aircrew welcoming passengers on board with a simple buon giorno and a smile when embarking she greeted the passenger in front of me and behind me and ignored me the other male crew members who were offering water and a biscuit and were collecting the rubbish were very courteous when disembarking this same female member of the aircrew was stood at the exit and greeting passengers as they left one more she greeted the passengers in front me and behind me and did not greet me i believe that i am entitled to the same standard of treatment as the other passengers i do not know the motivations for this particular member of the air crews omission towards me however i do think they fall beneath the standards of her training and basic common courtesy
13034,korean air,3,nickel and dime culture,los angeles to chiang mai via seoul we decided to spend a little bit more for our flight to thailand in exchange for a better service and were disappointed we could have saved several hundreds of dollars if we had used a chinese budget airline what was good about korean air were the flight attendants who were super friendly and helpful on our return flight to lax they even carried my carry on bag for me when they saw that i was holding our baby the reason why we wont fly with korean air anymore i had ordered a vegetarian oriental meal not vegan but vegetarian which isnt as restrictive what i received was a joke it looked like someone had emptied half a can of peas into the aluminum container and thrown some bok choi leaves on top no sauce tofu rice or potatoes horrible my wife was still hungry after her meal and asked for a snack the answer was we dont carry any snacks contrary to what their website says snack service a wide variety of snacks such as samgak kimbop cup ramen pizza and makkoli rice cakes are served on long flights the flight attendant explained we stopped offering cup ramen because of the smell when my wife told him that she used to get ramen on previous flights i had one can of beer at the beginning of the flight and ordered a gin tonic several hours later this drink spilled because my table was defective the kind which you pull out from the armrest when i asked for another drink they watered it down and advised me this is your last drink each passenger is allowed to have only 3 drinks i was not the slightest little bit drunken and very surprised because even on low budget airlines like air india nobody told me how many drinks i could have this is obviously a policy which is supposed to save the airline money we both started to get a headache because of dehydration when i asked for water the flight attendant poured approximately 4 table spoons into a cup i went back and forth several times between our seats and the pantry and each time they filled the cup only 50 we were both thirsty during the entire flight before departure there was a bottle of water on each seat and as soon as the boarding was completed they hurried to collect the water bottles from the vacant seats probably in order to lock them up in the safe 5 we had purchased an inflatable pillow which was specifically designed for air travel as soon as my wife started to inflate the pillow several flight attendants approached us saying that we were not allowed to use it obviously korean airs management made decisions in order to save money and we felt this nickel and dime culture during the entire trip if we had chosen a low cost chinese airline we may have received some kind of rude treatment but enough to eat and drink for several hundred dollars less
11199,iberia,8,really good experience,i was really looking forward to this flight as i do fly between madrid and london a lot and iberia flies also their a330s and even a350 on this route so picking up time to try their a350 was no brainer iberia also offers upgrade to business class at check in you wont get extra miles or extra baggage allowance but you get full experience fast track lounge and of course on board experience this time it cost 52 euros which is a pretty good price and worth paying i got to airport only 2 hours before as i was busy during the day checked in my carry on you can for free as i was filming this experience as well and went through fast track which was close at london heathrow you only got to skip most of the line the flight was leaving from gates c but there is no lounge there so i went to ba lounge right after security which was a bit crowded but managed to get a seat got some snack and drink for hot food you have to use qr code and order online but didnt have much time as boarding started already took me like 15 minutes to get there but you can board any time using priority lane unfortunately everyone boarded through one jet bridge even though there were more doors and it could have been done differently on board i had seat 3l which was really wide comfortable and i like that its 121 so everyone has aisle access which is great unfortunately my ife wasnt working so i was moved to 8a which is exactly the same type of seat most private one which is exactly what i wanted so all good there is no pillow or blanket on this 2 hours flight which makes sense and no pre departure drink which is lacking a bit headphones are good though and i cant complain seat in general is very wide and comfortable and im sure i would be comfortable to be there for 10 or more hours business class passengers also have free wifi even though only basic but better than nothing service started around 3040 minutes and there were two food options i took a beef and it was good its served on the tray but i get that its short flight and for drink i got gin and tonic and coke overall happy with service as for ife there are plenty of choices and im sure i would have enough things to watch on 10 hours flight overall really good experience just one little thing crew pretty much always start speaking spanish and keeps doing it would be better if they first ask you if you speak spanish and than try to remember at least for business i get that economy is too big otherwise happy with this airline and a350 is really nice aircraft
13918,lion air,2,worst flying experience,lombok to jakarta worst flying experience i have experienced first there is no transparency about the departing time 2 hours of delay which turned out into 3 hour delay because of operational reasons the desk operator doesnt gave us the clear and complete information about the delay and they were rude to the customers a dirty cabin we have to wait for a long time for a shuttle airport bus after a latenight flight about 30 minutes and then wait 45 minutes to get our baggage this is definitely my last time flying using this airline
40,adria airways,6,service of a low cost airline,adria airways has the price of a regular airline but the service of a low cost airline all the beverages and food are for purchase the seats are fine staff is friendly since we usually travel very early in the morning or very late in the evening we use the flight to rest every time we ask for a pillow we get one it might sound strange but this is very important for us

3298,airasia india,1,virtual assistant is of no use,the company doesnt have any live customer care people to talk to which in times us really needed to get important information easily their so called virtual assistant ava is of no use i tried checking my flight rescheduled time number of times and all the time the result was there are no flights thirdly the flight which was supposed to be departed around 8pm it got rescheduled 3 times which in turn made the flight to be departed at 1 am next day the boarding in the plane started at 1245 am which delayed the flight further lastly there were no announcements being made regarding this matter
21564,uzbekistan airways,6,cabin clean and bright,an internal flight from urgench to tashkent as the airport is small has only 4 flights a day check in was simple and fast no chances of getting lost you walk out to the plane on the tarmac ryanair style the cabin is clean and bright with simple economy seats on a 3 3 fashion the 4 staff soon had people on board and bags stored the pre flight briefing was from drop down screens that then showed a 15 minute video of uzbekistan in flight the crew served a selection of cold drinks after take off and this time no one was able to get tea from the business class section of the plane the flight was straight forward and took around 50 minutes landing in tashkent was quick and we were taken from a remote stand to the terminal by bus bags where on the belt when we arrived
5163,ba cityflyer,8,excellent flight experience,amsterdam to london city with ba cityflyer on the embraer e190sr checkin went well however could have been quicker to drop of my baggage as two of the handling staff were apparently busy chatting with each other once at the gate i chose to give my hand luggage to them to check into their hold as aircraft was full and as compensation i was told that i could use their priority lane flight departed on time and arrived on time during the flight cabin crew worked efficiently however catering was quite poor compared to competitors on this line seating was spacious and comfortable landing was performed well in gusty conditions luggage in hold took it time to be on our belt could have been faster after all an excellent flight experience and money well spent
10410,germanwings,7,germanwings customer review,as germanwings is the lowcost carrier of lufthansa it is of course better not to choose them for flights longer than 3hrs i bought a ticket for eur 150 duspmidus smart tariff and was very satisfied with the service very friendly staff and for a 2hr flight spacious seats with smart tariff you have 1 x luggage and 1 x meal included the snack is ok nothing special
12484,jetstar asia,2,cheap flights are not worth the hassle,the cheap flights are not worth the hassle for my flight from manila to singapore checkin was slow excess baggage fee of 100 inability to check in online no customer support and of course the jammed seats jetstar asia is a step down from the japan counterpart i recommend paying extra 80 and flying singapore airlines or even airasia last time i fly jetstar in asia
6064,british airways,4,all in all very disappointing,my husband and i booked seats within our premium economy booking on both outward journey ba015 on 12 february and return on 11 march we were last or almost last to be served food each time they had run out of our choices on one occasion i did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me on all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curryspicy food all in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of british airways
19922,thai airasia,7,overcrowded and poor service,nothing unusual for a budget carrier but if you can upgrade yourself so you can get a lounge pass for the phuket airport its probably one of the airiest and friendliest lounges in one of the happiest airports you are likely to find anywhere the flight itself was a typical airasia experience overcrowded and poor service but you pay for what you get
17405,s7 siberia airlines,5,s7 siberia airlines customer review,domedovochelyabinsk return first time with s7 online booking great although no english spoken at their ticket desk a320 was clean old but in good condition the captain made announcements in russian and in english and cabin crew although friendly spoke almost no english senior flight attendant spoke no english at all food good but i advise you to take a bottle of water from duty free with you all magazines were in russian s7s hub is domodedovo which is an advantage for your trips to russia
1811,air india,4,service and customer experience lacking,air india now owned by tatas but overall service and customer experience still lacking and poor i travelled from singapore to bangalore and then boarded air india the flight left my baggage at bangalore and i had to waste 2 hrs in mumbai airport i was told that in my baggage side pocket there was a lighter i acknowledged and appreciated their promptness on my return the flight was again delayed by 2 hrs someone opened my bag and lifted it the food served inflight during lunch was also pathetic i had planned to have my lunch in bangalore however due to a delay had to rely on air india i just had sweet yogurt and returned the rest thank you for landing me safely
10939,hawaiian airlines,9,really good clean and comfortable,my overall experience with this airline is really good clean and comfortable best part is entertainment options are good especially with kids staff and all crew members are good too one request to all airlines when someone traveling with kids give them seats that are comfortable for them with kids because some people are really rude during flights they dont want any noise they dont understand that kids cant keep quiet for 5 6 hours sometimes its really hard for those who are traveling with kids
19330,sunwing airlines,4,such an inconvenience,id like to know why this airline has to transport its passengers from terminal 3 to a small good for nothing terminal 2 miles away by bus when west jet same company has its passengers board at terminal 3 with plenty of gates open this is such an inconvenience plus they havent changed since the last time we flew with them in 2020 whats up sunwing ive flown sunwing about 10 times now i guess its time for a change
17905,shanghai airlines,3,shanghai airlines customer review,ctupvg on b737800 2 hours delay supposed to depart at 1925 turned out to be the inbound flight did not arrive until 1945 we got on board but sat on the tarmac for another hour due to heavy traffic asked the crew the estimated departure time the answer was i have no idea seats all right for domestic flight however i was on the last row right next to the lavatory and it smelled badly passengers cell phones started to ring when we were still in the air just before we touch down the crew did not do anything to stop them not a good experience and i prefer to fly with china eastern instead of shanghai air
19418,surinam airways,3,surinam airways customer review,i have traveled surinam airways 3 times and none of those times we departed on time the service on board is good though and they serve a hot meal at least i fly most of the time from aruba to miami but instead of leaving at 11 am we departed 8pm the other day supposed to leave miami around 330 pm instead we left around 1 am we spent 13 hours at miami international they provided us with a 10 voucher for food unacceptable
7060,china southern airlines,9,i really enjoyed it,it is a nice flying experience with china southern airlines and i really enjoyed it crew members provide excellent services on the aircraft staff on the ground also provide great service
21112,tunisair,2,tunisair customer review,this is not my first review on tunis air but since the closure of the londontunis flight on ba this is the only scheduled direct service from the uk right now departed on the tu790 on the 06th april the flight was over 2 hours late arriving into london on the inbound so did not depart until some time after the std outbound aircraft tsimh was very old 1994 and extremely dirty inside the cabin crew were not very happy and showed this in the service or lack of during the flight meals were simply a piece of bread with cheese and chicken and 1 service of drinks the most memorable part of the flight was going to the rear cabin once the food and drinks service was concluded the cabin crew 6 members were having a wonderful time socialising with no regard or interest in the passengers the return flight that i took on the 13th april as the return leg tu791 was operated by a much newer 2013 aeroplane tsimv however again clearly tunis air have either a very poor outsourced company which do the aircraft cleaning in tunis airport or they simply do not clean their planes in order to save costs at least 1 cabin crew member was on board who operated the flight a week earlier unfortunately again the service was a complete repeat of the earlier flight tunis air are under increasing pressure i am informed to perform as an airline who frankly have not for some time however if this is an indication of the measures they are taking to improve the service then i do not hold much hope for the airline going forward and once ezy start their service from stnmir in june i will be switching my business to them
16296,porter airlines,2,worst staff attitude,the worst staff attitude ever i was on my way from us to montreal via toronto and forgot my portable charger in the ny to toronto flight with 2 credit cards on the backside of it as soon as i was at security check for my connecting flight to montreal i realised it and informed the porter desk in the lounge they called the aircraft staff and got to know that they found the stuff since i had a flight in next 15 minutes they told me to jump on the flight and that they would send my stuff in the next flight which was just after 30 mins of this flight they asked me to speak with the portal staff in montreal i contacted their staff at the montreal airport and they said we did not get any message about any such suff left i said pls check my file and that they would put the note on my file as they assured me at the toronto airport the lady did not even bother to check this and asked me to wait for 30 mins till the next flight arrives i waited for almost 40 mins and then asked the lady again so she said she is going to check on the flight which just arrived she comes after another 10 mins and does not even bother to inform me as to whether she found it or not i go to her again and she carelessly says that they havent sent anything in this flight i told her that i have my 2 credit cards in it and no cash left she suggested me to contact the manager in the departure area when i went there the manager contacted the staff at toronto airport and he was continually asking me to whom i got in touch with at the toronto airport i said i did not ask the name he said that he is not able to know whom i contacted and that they dont know whether they found my stuff i said that i am sure that they had found it and they were going to send that in the next flight finally they just gave me a recipe of lost stuff and asked me to wait for a call
9466,finnair,3,very disappointing experience,very disappointing experience london wouldnt check us in the whole way so there was a huge queue in helsinki at the boarding gate to get our documents checked again secondly i had 3 lots of seat changes to my flights without asking and or notifying me of the changes i selected 1a in advance months prior i noticed i was moved to another seat before departure spoke to customer service via chat who said 1a was blocked and unserviceable i then moved seats online to my second choice to then find in helsinki i had been moved again and dumped in a seat right next to the engine and of course when i boarded the flight someone was sitting in 1a when i had been told the seat was blocked and not serviceable i feel like this airline doesnt care about their customers in business class and they just blatantly lie about everything i gave them the opportunity to rectify the issue including providing complaintfeedback before departure which was not replied to so its obvious they couldnt care less about the quality of their business class experience
857,air astana,9,a 4 star experience,nur sultan to frankfurt in every sense a 4 star experience as a frequent traveller it was my first 4 flights from fra to ala via tse and back and i was impressed an excellent product with attention to detail the presentation and quality of the inflight catering in my opinion is slightly above a 4 star carrier great airlinegreat product
3996,alitalia,2,very unpleasant experience,so paulo to rome horrible experience regarding service the airplane may not be new but considering its economy class the seats are spacious if compared to newer airplanes but what was really terrifying about this flight was the horrible appalling service given by the flight attendants in the section of the airplane where i was seated 22l those staff simply hate their jobs and make it clear that they hate having to serve other people disgracefully these other people are the clients who paid for a seat on their airplanes hoping to receive some decent service which doesnt happen these crew members are the most unkind unattentive and rudest professionals of all crews in european airlines due to my job i have to fly alitalia frequently and its always a very unpleasant experience if you can avoid alitalia whenever possible
16407,qantas airways,1,the worst customer service ive ever encountered,qantas cancelled our flight two years ago and still has not refunded us the hundreds of dollars in excess baggage we paid for ive spoken to them about this many times and they dont deny they owe us the money they just say someone will get back to us about it and no one ever does any time i phone they say they have no record of any of the hours and hours ive spent on the phone with them before and say they need all the information again if i have a reference number from the last call when i call again they say the number doesnt refer to anything and they have no record of the case the worst customer service ive ever encountered and its cost us money we couldnt spare but they really dont care avoid at all costs
17169,rwandair,6,overall service was good,about the service is been so wonderful in helping us navigate the checking process food wise need to improve more travelling with a special child is always challenging but with the help of staff its been less stressful and for that im forever grateful overall service was good
20595,tigerair,6,an okay experience,ningbo to singapore with tigerair and the flight was okay staff was unfriendly and didnt smile but i didnt have to interact with them except hello and goodbye both of which went unanswered the departure was a bit delayed 30 minutes but we arrived in singapore almost on time seats were quite comfortable nice magazine to read i would fly with them again if the flight is cheap enough as overall it was an okay experience
17007,royal brunei airlines,6,respectful and courteous,i found the seats to be very hard and uncomfortable for a long haul flight from melbourne to heathrow via brunei with royal brunei airlines we ended up sitting on our slightly inflated neck pillows that helped a little leg room in front was ok but the seats were very narrow if a passenger in front reclined it made it difficult to eat from the tray and to view the screen the meals were pretty good on the first leg but then went downhill from there they were a little better on the way home from london food was plentiful and delivered with a smile due to there being no alcohol served the toilets remained clean and there was never a queue for them so the noise level within the aircraft was always at a minimum even the babies were great the customer service was outstanding very respectful and courteous they are happy to help in anyway they can brunei airport is very basic and very hot i dont think they like to use air conditioning and the lights were kept low
3054,air transat,4,aircraft did not offer a bassinet,i had a very hard time getting in touch with customer service over an hour wait i originally spoke with an agent before booking who confirmed the availability of seats with extra leg space as i was travelling with 2 kids by myself of course after paying and booking the air transat agent said there were only 2 seats available and i had to let go two agents were giving me conflicting information and i asked to speak with a manager they said you will have to wait an unknown amount of time which can be a few hours it was also disappointing that a aircraft with a long flight to europe did not offer a bassinet they claim the seats are bigger in this new aircraft but i did not feel that was the case i also tried to modify our return booking i wasnt able to do so via the app or website i kept on getting an error message and had to call customer service and wait for more than an hour i travel a lot and this is by far the worst airline service never to be repeated
19381,sunwing airlines,2,would never recommend sunwing,paid for direct flight january 27 2020 from santa clara to saskatoon flight delay of 2 hours arrived at airport when boarding began heard from other passengers that we were going to montego bay when in montego bay pilot stated we will be going to windsor ontario to fuel up arrived in saskatoon at 440 in the morning nearly 6 hours late sunwing does not give customers accurate information and provides very poor service we would never recommend sunwing buyer beware
20510,thomson airways,3,feel conned and cheated,manchester to larnaca return my complaint is that i changed my holiday plans to a more expensive one after thomson airways told me i would fly on the boeing 787 when we boarded the aircraft on both legs it was a very uncomfortable boeing 767 i feel conned and cheated why do thomson treat their customers with such contempt lots of passengers were very angry about this
2257,air mauritius,7,friendly welcoming and helpful,mauritius to paris cdg check in process was slow with long queues even though i was using the priority check in queue only two desks were open to handle 4 air mauritius departures in total the wait was around 40 minutes to check in however when i finally got to the check in desk the process was efficient the lounge experience is detailed separately at the departure gate the process was chaotic there were 9 gate staff standing around but only two actually doing any work the staff were unfriendly and didnt want to engage with the passengers they gave the impression that they didnt want to be there doing the job and did not come up to the air mauritius standard for customer service this lowers the overall rating given the gate staff began releasing passengers before the crew were ready to receive them i was the first passenger to the aircraft and had to wait on the air bridge for 5 minutes while the cabin crew finished their cabin preparations once on board the cabin crew were what i had become accustomed to with air mauritius they were friendly welcoming and helpful and are a credit to the airline this a340300 was one of the refitted aircraft and the cabin was very nice this aircraft now has lie flat beds in business and the interior is now similar to the a350 minus wifi seats are comfortable food and beverage service was good and the food was surprisingly delicious the departure time was 2230 so it was late to eat a main meal but non the less it was good breakfast was served 90 minutes prior to landing and was adequate its difficult to make airline breakfasts anything special i didnt use the ife but there did appear to be a good selection of films to watch
10704,gulf air,8,service was great,the flight was smooth and service was great i didnt take the food as i was had enjoyed lounge food prior to boarding the entertainment system had new movies which i like even though its a short flight i wish boarding was more organized where people boarded based on their rowszones because it can get chaotic
6596,cathay pacific airways,8,overall the trip is not bad,the flight was full but managed to take off on time overall the trip is not bad but i wish to see more passion and smile from the cabin crew services were delivered on time and the cabin crews quickly dished out food to passengers the food roast beef with potatoes was beyond my expectation i didnt expect that kind of food from economy class the airline didnt cheap out dessert and still offer haagen daaz ice cream which always lifts up the overall dining experience
11011,hong kong airlines,8,cabin crew and service is good,beijing to hong kong ticket quite cheap comparing to an average of hk2500 this was only hk1000 new aircraft check in at pek is fast but boarding is a little messy cabin crew and service is good they may also accept flight logs meal was nasty as usual since air cater was done in pek
19667,tam airlines,4,crew were sitting in our seats,travelled domestically on tam from grumao in relax business class on the a330 we were in seats 1d1g the seats were situated in the first class compartment of plane which has just 4 seats these were full flat beds and very comfortable the cabin was quite dated and shabby carpet all frayed and very dirty and the seats were quite tatty upon boarding the cabin crew were sitting in our seats and seemed quite miffed that wed been assigned the seats and that had to move cabin service was awful onboard within 10 mins of seatbelt sign being released the crew came through offering a small cheese bun and a soft drink they were not seen again for the remainder of the 4hour flight entertainment was okay but not as good as the 767 we travelled out on flight was on time and actually arrived about 15 mins early
9471,finnair,4,they have next to no customer service,flight out from london to helsinki and then onwards to bangkok went well they are not very clear on what business light is when you book the flight but i guess easy to find out yourself and i travelled with carry on so it wasnt an issue for me connection in helsinki went fine airplane was fairly new service onboard ok food and drinks options a bit like premium economy in other airlines so nothing to write home about but it was ok now the return flight got delayed which meant i was being rebooked on another airline since then ive been trying to contact finnair about getting my airmiles for that section might sound trivial but i paid for a business class flight and those points would have come very handy in reducing my cost of future flights they have next to no customer service calling doesnt work that automated service is laughable finally after about 4 weeks i got a reply that there is nothing they can do and thats that now im thinking what if my issue was something more serious than missing airmiles i cant imagine flying with them again if there is no way to contact customer service other airlines like ba lufthansa etc arent perfect but at least you get to talk to someone and they answer your emails
17874,shanghai airlines,5,shanghai airlines customer review,we bought two tickets to travel from melbourne to beijing via shanghai late dec 2014 without any prior knowledge we were put on shanghai airlines instead on both legs outbound aircraft was a bit old but the inbound was rather new and clean ife english programs are rather limited and not up to date they didnt change the movies selection our outbound and inbound flights were in different months established airlines usually refresh the ife at the beginning of each month food was ordinary very chinese and please bring your own food if you are hard to please the fa served water very regularly two thumbs up too many announcements turbulence related and we were very annoyed passengers should have some common senses and not require reminders from the fas all in a very basic airline
15423,olympic air,8,olympic air customer review,cdgath a320 welcomed by a friendly crew seats quite comfortable i was sitting one row behind the emergency exit and the cabin crew came to brief the passengers about the operation of the doors in case of emergency started service with drinks and then a hot meal after that more drinks as well as coffee or tea along with a box of chocolate cookies overall good service smiling crew and good value for money bearing in mind i booked the ticket a few days ago and the plane was nearly full still room for improvement though as there is still no in flight entertainment or a good magazine to keep the passengers busy
4819,austrian airlines,5,very upsetting and discriminatory,i flew back to montreal last saturday with os i could not believe my eyes and ears when we were told the seats at our gate were reserved for business class passengers only and that we had to stand or find other seats elsewhere over 75 of the seats remained empty until boarding no other flights in this area had the section cordoned off people were pretty upset and the poor agent got an ear full in my opinion this is not acceptable and very upsetting and discriminatory
17002,royal brunei airlines,9,delightful experience overall,melbourne to ho chi minh ccty via bandarseri bagawan delightful experience overall checking in was quick and easy with express passes for departure lounge access at cathay pacific lounge in melbourne and pass for the lounge in brunei we were permitted 40kg which apparently can be spread over multiple bags boarding was confusing as they call up families and business at once so you are in a line boarding as many families were travelling it seemed our seat on the plane was very spacious but we couldnt have any bags stowed near us all had to be put in the locker we were offered juiceswater prior to take off menus were distributed and the staff during this first leg were fabulous very friendly they referred to us by name the entertainment selection was very good the food was superb the steak ordered was very tender and the quantity of food ensured we were well and truly satisfied yet there were snacks available also we had to go through security again to board our next flight the flight from bandar seri bagawan was on a smaller plane and it was late arriving thus late leaving the staff were not as friendly on this section but we still got fed a sizeable main meal all in all it was a positive experience and one i would love to do again
10437,germanwings,9,germanwings customer review,flown verona to cologne connecting to manchester i think this airline deserves its 3star status its peculiar as a lowcost airline as it offers connecting flights though prices average double compared to the cheapest point to point options the space for legs on a standard a319 is the best ive found in the last 6 years of low cost travelling personnel look professional throughout onboard prices quite competitive for euro nationals i will definitely fly with them if i need to go to germany in future
22013,vistara,6,service with a smile lots of patience,would love to share my appreciation for the 2 wonderful ladies manning the check in counter vistara airways at t3 new delhi on 5th april could gather their names are ronali and reena service with a smile lots of patience helping me out i while i had to transfer my pastry cutlery from cabin to checked baggage as i struggled to rush forward to the ongoing flight was a big help keep it up ladies i remain a vistara loyal flier only issue is that inflight food quality has gone down hope you can do something about that do give a big thanks to your ladies mentioned here

21790,virgin america,4,ground staff was unpleasant,first return flight with virgin america from new york jfk to san francisco announced delay of 130hrs due the weather but the weather at sfo is 10mph wind with rain and other flights are taking off to there when i gently asked the ground staff whats the issue and to tell me about the weather impact on our flight schedule she was unpleasant not willing to talk about the topic this gives me the feeling that this company is not honest with passengers
14451,malaysia airlines,4,very disappointed with the product,excellent staff and attentive service ancient aircraft with an excuse for an entertainment system the route from hanoi to kuala lumpur had no entertainment systems they said the screens and the usb ports do not work for this leg of the journey very disappointed with the product malaysia airlines is offering they were really good like a decade or two ago
23025,xl airways france,2,i am horrified by the service,if you are tempted to fly with this airline because of the wonderful price do not do it the flight out to paris was wonderful the plane was empty so everyone had their own row to relax the troubles didnt start until we arrived in paris on our flight to paris they lost our babies car seat when we went to check in today the lady at the counter was rude and unfriendly we handed her 5 passports three for adults and two children we had 4 bags to check in a stroller and we had our 2 year olds car seat we have a double stroller i was holding our ten month old and our two year old was sleeping in the stroller in san francisco they put stickers on all three pieces because the stroller breaks down into three pieces when we told her that the stroller did that she rolled her eyes and said really then we tried to check in our two year olds car seat she said nope you cant take it or you have to pay for it when i explained they hadnt charged us for it in san francisco she said well that is san francisco she then called the airline and they said we had to pay 50 for the seat she told us we had to go to a separate counter to pay then come back to her as we were leaving she said wait let me put the stickers on the stroller as she was putting the sticker on one of the pieces she noticed our daughter and said oh you have another child we said yes you have her passport to which she then said oh you dont have to pay anymore instead of apologizing she just said your finished we upgraded to seats 4 thinking they would be wonderful seats because of our previous flight but the seats had less space than before they were so uncomfortable especially having a twenty pound baby on your lap there was a section in front of us nobody knew was available when i finally got the attention again of a stewardess the doors were being closed and she said that i needed to go to the gate to pay what kind of airline charges for everything other than water coffee and tea but wont let you buy up a seat there were 8 seats open those seats remained open all flight our ten month old was walking back and forth in front of our seats holding onto the seats we didnt notice but there was an ashtray in our daughters seat in it was trash with liquid and food it stuck and was disgusting our son put his hand in it when i asked the stewardess to do something about it she said you think its my problem i said to her i am not saying you own the airplane but you are the only one whos really able to do anything because you have the access to things to clean it she rolled her eyes at me 6 minutes later another stewardess came with gloves and took out the trash and in the process got liquid on us and said there i got everything she went and got a napkin dabbed and said there i am done and walked away 6th thing for a couple hours service was non existent we were trying to make a bottle for our ten month old so he could sleep and we pushed the service button but nobody came for 30 minutes i am horrified by the service
14564,malindo air,6,disappointed with refund issues,kuching to kuala lumpur i am disappointed with the management of refund issues i booked twice the tickets due to first time screen shown that my booking was not successful and so i rebook though the price was slightly different later email came with two bookings and was charged to my credit card immediately on the same day i reported duplicate of bookings i was advised by the customer service that they can only refund the lower fare and so i checked in the higher rate 2 days early before my flight to date the issue still under investigation the counter found that ive two bookings on the system so they called up the office the office told the staff to checked in the lower fare and cancelled my higher fare told me that the other ticket will be refund in 30 days time to date they had been giving excuses that ive utilised the lower fare and so they can only refund the higher fare tax only this is absurd by right i am entitled to the refund it is the incompetence of the counter staff fault that caused this problem how can an investigation took so long

4891,avelo airlines,6,recommend this with reservations,i was a bit wary reading the reviews here after i purchased my one way ticket i usually book a round trip with one airline but i booked two one way tickets due to the holiday period check in crew was fine and had no problems checking my prepaid bag in boarding process was a lot less orderly than southwest and the seating was tight avelo does acquire used 737700s from swa but uses another airline to buy 737800s i knew they didnt have snacks so that didnt bother me but the flight was bumpy due to the weather and flight attendants were ok the flight was on time i made it in one piece and my bag was fine i recommend this with reservations since they keep swa competitive pricing wise

10321,georgian airways,9,georgian airways customer review,i recently flew from vienna to tbilisi and back both flights were operated by a clean crj aircraft both flights departed and arrived on time the flight attendants were very kind and spoke english really well food on board was great both flights were fully packed with passengers seats were a little cramped but still relatively comfortable there was no inflight entertainment onboard which was to be expected since both flights were operated by a small crj aircraft overall i was very pleased i would definitely recommend flying georgian airways
19860,tap portugal,1,no messages or refunds from tap,my flight from amsterdam to lisbon was cancelled three hours before departure when i was already at the airport even though tap had my email address and telephone number there was no further communication at all it was only when i logged in with my booking reference that i saw that i had been rebooked to leave very early the following morning with a layover in munich that would take me nine hours no hotel voucher was offered and i decided to cancel my trip the tap website was totally unhelpful for this and i had to wait for 30 minutes in the queue for a telephonic help desk it was only then that i managed to cancel and request a refund we are now three weeks on and there have been no messages or refunds from tap so far no contact data are provided to make enquiries about the refund i consider my money lost
1650,air europa,7,decent flight crew service,first timer here with this airline quite inline to my expectations meaning they are part of an air alliance so they should be holding to a minimum service standard overall it was ok the best aspects of my flights experience part of skyteam so my luggage transfer from klm was easy and seamless we flew with the boeing 787 so it was nice and new decent flight crew service the areas where ae can improve their company site can be more user friendly as i had a bit of trouble trying to manage my booking prior to my departure seat selection is also not complimentary for everyone during web check in inflight entertainment has limited new movies not bad overall but i just wish they can offer free seats 48 hr before departure
20625,tigerair,9,tigerair customer review,1st time on budget carrier tr2288 on 15 jun lots of people almost full flight a brand new aircraft a320 sharklets more comfortable breathing than 20 jun ri836 stuffy aircon staff were very friendly the duty free was on 30 discount when disembarking the plane the staff cheerfully greeted passengers ground staff were good not so strict with baggage weight compared to some airlines overall i will not mind flying tiger airways again
6353,canadian north,5,canadian north customer review,flew with canadian north on two occasions found both flights to be very enjoyable first flight was edmonton to norman wells and the next was edmonton to yellowknife found check in staff to be friendly and helpful both times flight attendants were very courteous and friendly no corny jokes unlike westjet meals are also included with the fare for breakfast it was a hot or cold meal for dinner on the way home it was pork or chicken with free wine almost unheard of today on domestic economy flights the airplane was an older 737 but in nice condition and lots of baggage allowance would fly with them again and strongly recommend them
34,adria airways,6,cabin staff rather absent,lodz to paris cdg and munich to lodz with adria airways decent service for short hops like those i took small and cramped cabin in a clean crj700 the flight lcjcdg was nearly empty so i felt like being in a private jet muclcj with 65 load factor checkin via internet with an option to select seats without any problem both flights on time cabin staff rather absent just served a glass of water for free although we were informed about possibility to connect to onboard wifi i couldnt manage to do that if you do not expect a 5star service adria should be a good option for quick and not too expensive flight
9688,fly540com,9,fly540com customer review,nairobikitale and return both flights were on time plane noisy but comfortable cabin staff helpful costs reasonable would recommend and will use again
3737,airnorth,5,airnorth customer review,i have to put in some severe criticism of airnorths customer service during the ash cloud disruption in june my original morning flight on sat 31 may dilidarwin was cancelled fair enough airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home the call centre told about midday that they hadnt decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later about 3pm i got a call from the qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm sunday then on sunday morning i looked at airnorths website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 1245pm so i rushed off to the airport it turned that was wrong and we were sent home the call centre isnt open on sundays so i had no idea what was happening eventually i saw on darwin airports website that the incoming fight had been cancelled all other airlines operated normally from dili and darwin that afternoon airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me i was rescheduled for 5pm monday normally airnorth flights have been fine on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway however they really cant handle anything unusual and given their monopoly on many routes they probably wont bother to improve
11198,iberia,4,i will never fly iberia again,worst customer service the airline lost our luggage i had to call multiple times daily to try and find it i was sent to a voice mail to leave a message which were never returned when i did get a customer service agent i would be redirected multiple times and no answers this process took 5 days yes 5 days without luggage the customer servicebaggage claim was no help at all i finally got help from the airport that did not have any association with iberia but they took the time to look and guess what my bag was sitting in their holding area noone at iberia ever called if it was up to iberia i still would not have my luggage when i arrived home i noticed that my bag was damaged i call customer service again after 20 minutes on the phone i got sorry theres nothing we can do i will never fly iberia again
13224,kuwait airways,9,will definitely fly again,kuwait to london enjoyed the flight specially my kids the crew was very attentive helpful and the seating was specious also leg area the entertainment was good with the option of listening to quran will definitely fly again in kuwait airways during summer vacation
14377,mahan air,8,mahan air customer review,flew on a very large a340600 in business class the checkin was organized and the fast track provided was helpful in bypassing the very long immigrationsecurity lines they used the thai airways lounge which was fantastic boarding was via a bus and despite the airlines effort was not too comfortable i found the flight attendants to be attentive and polite plenty of food and nonalcoholic drinks and natural juices the on board lounge was a nice experience and i enjoyed the iranian treats the business class seat was full flat with mattress and a nice blanket which improved the sleep quality when compared with other aircraft i have flown a nice snack before our early morning arrival into tehran overall a pleasant flight
18086,silkair,6,movie and entertainment choices limited,bandung to singapore with silkair the food was good we had fresh salmon for our lunch you need to use your personal devices in order to connect to the onboard entertainment system movie and entertainment choices limited the aircraft looked old and interior not so great compare with the newer cabins
10075,french bee,1,its good value for money,i dont understand why everyone hates on this airline i flew from paris to san francisco and back in may 2019 the plane was new enough space great service perfect entertainment program relaxed bag rules if you read the booking rules carefully and purchase the extras courteous stewards safe feeling inside good food unlimited supply of water clean punctual the only problem is the booking process which is a bit counterintuitive but this has nothing to do with the flight itself id really recommend french bee the prices are super cheap also so its good value for money
11947,jeju air,3,very disappointing service,very disappointing service especially at its home base icn checked in online the day before departure and still arrived at the airport 2 hours before departure which would be before 6am and found out that there was basically no benefit at all for the extra effort the previous day i still had to go through the endless wait the queue was so long that it completely filled up the massive checkin area at icn and still seeped out into the corridor area one might wonder that the queue was probably because some of the machines were out of order but no the queue was really just to drop checked luggage via superslow machines in short the airline was basically not allowing any nonpremium customers to be served by humans just by selfcheckin kiosks for those lazy customers who dared not check in online the day before departure and by selfbag drop machines which were absolutely lacking in number and seemed to confuse the customers all the time what happened after the stressful bag drop simple the flight was delayed by 20 minutes which snowballed into an overall delay of 40 minutes when i finally landed in fuk considering that icnfuk is supposed to take 80 minutes from gate to gate this delay is horrible i ended up almost missing my selfarranged connecting domestic flight despite a generous selfsecured transit time of 25 hours thanks to the massive delay caused by jeju air paid 300 just for a short roundtrip ticket between icn and fuk completed online checkin the day before and still arrived at the airport 2 hours only to find out that checking in luggage is something to be punished at jeju air by an endless queue and had to wait in line for 30 minutes just to drop my pithy bag then found out that the flight was going to be hugely delayed and almost missed my domestic connection 25 hours apart jeju air only offers 15 kg as your base checked luggage allowance you have to purchase its flybag tier ticket to get any checked luggage allowance and even after that it is still only 15 kg even peach the supercheap lcc in japan offers 20 kg all the other services were just as expected mediocre seat pitch and comfort even according to lowcost airline standards okay cabin service not that they were bad but they were not that great either limited food beverage options and no inflight entertainment and cabin connectivity given the short flight distance however i guess the nonexistence of any inflight digital stuff should not be negatively judged upon jeju air
5981,breeze airways,2,not my preferred seating,paid for preferred seating and they placed us by the toilets and that was not my preferred seating when requested a refund the support chat was very rude and the inflight entertainment as advertised was never available on either flights
6349,canadian north,9,efficient and very pleasant,my husband and i traveled to yellowknife for a day the main reason was that we wanted to visit buffalo airways canadian north were fantastic both services on time and on the way back to edmonton we were lucky enough to travel on a 737200 combi which was fantastic the crew on the way home made us feel so welcome they were efficient and very pleasant great breakfast on the way up and a good dinner on the way back if only they were a bit closer to our home in australia we would be more than happy to travel with canadian north any time a great experience
18108,silkair,8,get what you paid for,short silkair flight from singapore to medan one way the ground service at changi airport were very professional and boarding was smooth the seat was standard for short haul flight and the plane seems very well maintained the meal was average but i didnt make a big deal out of it since it was a short flight even though it was short flight they still provided entertainment service via wireless connection this is my first time flying with silk air and i will fly with them in the future the price is premium though but you will get what you paid for
21083,tunisair,1,will avoid in future,nouakchott to tunis with tunisair aircraft late departing the aircraft was filthy and seat broken no inflight entertainment soiled and tattered inflight magazine food tasteless make cabin crew indifferent service almost arrogant no safety demo no seat belt check will avoid in future
3341,airasia philippines,2,decided to cancel my flight,second time i have flown with airasia philippines reason being the flight time was ideal for my connection coming in from london it gave me 2 hours to transfer from term 1 in manila to term 4 well thats what i thought until air asia decided to cancel my flight and transfer me to a flight some 7 hours later with no explanation upon checking in no apology was given however my blood shot did cause a stir i explained it was a burst blood vessel which was confirmed by my doctor in the uk the member of staff on check in told me to wait as she needed to consult her supervisor i was told by the supervisor i needed to see a doctor who was based at the airport i tried to explain but he wasnt having any of it it was either i saw the doctor or i wasnt be allowed to fly eventually i was seen firstly by a nurse who took my blood pressure asked me a number of questions about my eye i did inform her that i was not feeling any discomfort no itching no blurred visor infact nothing at all even telling them i had flown some 7000 miles for 15 hours from london with no problem the doctor as soon as she arrived said it was ok for me to fly if i sign an indemnity after all that i asked why they were so interested in my eye yet no tests questions were ask regarding covid no answer once on board all was ok i am not a mask wearer as this is not required at home i know when in roam but within the airport on the plane i was never asked to wear one
2169,air malta,3,there is a problem with checkin,malta to heathrow i used to go business class but unless you have the front row the leg room isnt very good it is also quite antiquated compared to say cathy pacific where for the same flighttime of around three hours you get your own cubicle a menu and topclass service i now fly economy and every time there is a problem with checkin instead of having designated checkin desks for each destination they have about five for all destinations this causes all sorts of problems as each flight destination has differing takeoff times its not rocket science to figure out if theres a huge holdup in your queue with everyone going to different places that the earlier flights have the danger of either missing their flight or spending so much time queuing you get no time to relax or have breakfast before boarding when i travelled to heathrow from malta in april this year the computer in our queue packed up instead of using some sort of intelligence and splitting our queue into other ones which were working we were simply standing waiting i had got to the airport early and spent almost an hour in the queue just standing in the end i jumped queues as i was worried i might miss my flight the checkin staff are very slow the slowest out of all the many airlines ive travelled with the only trouble is i have to use them as there is no alternative
21505,us airways,7,us airways customer review,dubphllaxphldub first experience with us and overall it was good good value for money pleasant and engaged cabin crew and the special meal pre ordered on the transatlantic legs of the trip was quite good by todays airline standards a nice touch on the outbound trip was a mid flight ice cream snack and the complementary wine with meals was also appreciated good selection on the transatlantic ife but surprisingly no ife on the us domestic a321s quite a limited inflight menu on domestic flights not much healthy food on offer and by the time cabin crew reached us they were sold out of most food items return flight from lax to phl was diverted to richmond due to atc restrictions in phl thankfully the dub flight was held so when we eventually got to phl we were able to make the connection which departed 1 hour 20 mins late in spite of this arrival in dub was 45 mins behind schedule
2647,air nostrum,3,leaves much to be desired,bologna to madrid the service of the leaves much to be desired from the attention at the time of checkin to the punctuality that does not exist one hour delay on the outward journey and two and a half hours on this return trip of which an hour and a half were inside the cabin without any attention or explanation the captain already with all the people ready to leave says that we were going to have to wait two hours to get out es el servicio de la aerolneas deja mucho que desear desde la atencin al momento del checkin a la puntualidad que no existe una hora de demora en el viaje de ida y dos horas y media en este viaje de regreso de las cuales una hora y media fueron dentro de la cabina sin ninguna atencin no mayor explicacin el comandante de a bordo ya con todas las personas listas para partir dice que bamos a tener que esperar dos horas para salir las compaas areas tienen todas las concesiones habidas y por haber mientras los clientes somos siempre rehenes
12084,jet2com,3,terrible service jet2,we checked on flight radar before leaving the hotel to find our flight delayed but according to the rep it was on time getting to the gates was straight forward but we soon realised there was a problem when we found out 4 flights from the uk were all delayed by around an hour the staff fed us some cock and bull story about why the delays had happened the gate was rammed with travellers not enough seats for everyone a lot had to sit on the floor terrible service jet2
4833,austrian airlines,3,the temperature was set to 24,flew business from lax to vie on june 20 cabin was warm when i boarded asked purser to cool it off yes no problem once we get going it will cool off after dinner went to bed woke up half way through the flight sweating was wearing shorts and a tshirt and not using the provided blanket rang the bell asked what the temperature was set to learned it was 24 24 is ridiculous austrian does not have individual air vents after arguing with the purser for over 10 minutes she agreed to lower it to 22 i argued this was not enough and argued there was no way i could sleep in such a hot cabin she then said do you feel how cold i am im freezing so because the purser is cold the whole cabin has to suffer in a saunalike environment on a 10 hour flight ive written letters to the standard customer service team and have forwarded comment to the head of operations asking what the policy is for cabin temperature 4 weeks later no response even though i think the products and service are generally better on international airlines i simply cant trust then to have a reasonable cabin temperature
8472,egyptair,1,i will never use egyptair,we were scheduled for our initial flight 850 from nairobi to cairo at 425 am in business class minutes before boarding the airport display showed one hour delay and according to the staff from egyptair a flat tire needed to be replaced hours had passed by with no real indication as to what the situation was and passengers had become very frustrated demanding answers after five long hours one of the executive representatives of egyptair mentioned to all of the passengers they were going to put up in a hotel because they couldnt find a spare tire for the aircraft we waited another two hours for the bus transportation and hotel accommodations the whole deal was horrifying with the transition of getting a new visa to enter back into the country the business class lounge had no real accommodating nourishing food it was basically appetizers and finger food that couldnt hold our nurturing standers for the long hours the bus transportation had no ac we were stuffed with our luggage and belongings into the bus like sardines being on top of each other not having any personal space or being mindful of covid19 i will never use egyptair or recommend it to anyone
13844,lion air,1,worst flight experience with lion air,never again i had my worst flight experience with lion air after more than 16h of flight from paris to jakarta the flight from jakarta to bali had several hours of delay no information provided
181,aegean airlines,5,some things are really frustrating,i dislike the fact that on too many arrivals this airline has not approached passenger walkways and is choosing the bus as if we are still in the 50s this was the case on our flight from larnaca to athens on 1011 arriving with more than an hour delay which was not announced until we were on board and in athens the bus like sardines despite the pandemic the very expensive fare is not justified by a tiny sandwich they give you in flight and you are given a choice of a fee seat only at the two last rows right next to the toilet that is is such a place they give you 6 only free seats you pay very dearly for the ticket pay extra for luggage or anything over 8 kg pay extra for a seat or take the seat next to the toilet the plane is perfect inflight service excellent pilots top class yet some things are really frustrating
15991,philippine airlines,1,the most terrible airline,you trust them to answer your questions about the booking and then before the flight it turns out that there was an error we could not tell you they can neither send an official letter with a response nor say the application number for a complaint or request a month before departure i called several times and clarified information on transporting animals on a specific flight they confirmed the transportation of the animal and told me how to proceed send them documents for exporting the animal three days before departure i bought a ticket and three days before departure i sent them all the documents and called to find out the status of the reservation support told me in surprise why did i get the idea that you can fly with an animal i talked with support all evening they even listened to my calls to them before buying a ticket and confirmed that yes it was their mistake and that it was really impossible to bring an animal and why another employee said so they dont know they dont help with a full refund they refer to the fact that it was my mistake when asked to listen to those calls they answer that they suddenly cannot do this and they cannot send the recordings to me either lost time money nerves and strength the most terrible airline
2216,air malta,5,cabin crew not a happy bunch,paris to malta the ground crew were very helpful at the gate since i did not have any seats assigned by air france because their computers had a glitch the cabin crew were not a happy bunch your felt as though you had crashed their party they did the minimum and one of them was actually quite abusive apparently that is acceptable according to air malta management the flight itself was smooth on time and a nice landing they should not waste their time serving the buns and water not my first choice to fly with taking into account the numerous other carriers available at the same or lower fares
166,aegean airlines,9,my first choice to and from greece,had to reschedule my flight to athens from london called the aegean customer service line to do this lines were busy but didnt wait long call answered by very polite agent i explained my situation about requiring my flight to be rescheduled and my onward connection within greece agent did this and explained the process in excellent english i paid the extra and booking was complete no fuss no bother flight was outstanding from start to finish as usual these are difficult times for everyone and we need a degree of flexibility i am still shocked to see how rude and aggressive some passengers are to airline staff when travelling aegean is still my first choice to and from greece no airline is perfect but they are better than most
16544,qatar airways,1,flights always on time,thank you qatar airways due to the nature of employment i fly on regularly with long distance flights since 2000 during 2020 with the covid outbreak my then carrier of choice stopped flights to and from johannesburg south africa qatar airways was the first airline that resumed flights from south africa and by times the flights were less than 10 full but qatar kept on flying and that bought my loyalty in addition to the above why do i continue with qatar airways flights always on time very important for me ground and flight personnel professional and friendly doha transit very quick and efficient even with numerous flights disembarking providing socks eye masks and toothpaste kits for even economy class food and drinks served of good quality and lastly flight schedules work out perfect for me
20736,tigerair taiwan,9,seamless and flawless flight,having no low cost carriers until relatively recently between bangkok and taipei this was one of the few major asian routes which meant a plane change in a third country to find a decent fare for budget travelers now it is served by two v air and tigerair taiwan on the basis of this flight both are excellent and put similar carriers in the shade the tigerair taiwan afternoon flight to bangkoks don mueang airport was boarded efficiently using a bus gate and taxiing commenced 10 minutes early fas were smartly dressed and super efficient smiling as they carried out their duties my preordered meal was piping hot unlike on some fullservice carriers who serve from a trolley all in all a seamless and flawless flight
14317,lynx air,2,it was such chaos,whole experience was extremely negative i paid 90 just to be able to check a bag but they lost my bag how do you lose a bag on a direct flight worst part is its been over a day and they still havent contacted me about where my bag is i needed all my stuff for my trip customer service has been literally awful no one is replying to my emails with updates the chat bot was absolutely useless i paid 90 just so they could lose my bag and barely communicate it would be one thing if it was delivered to me the next day but i am left wondering if i will see my personal items ever again i am never flying with them again on top of that when i arrived at the airport i checked my bag in at the very end they hand me my ticket and they tell me my flight was delayed 3 hours i go through security and then afterwards i find out its actually on time again but its moved gates it was such chaos
11086,hong kong airlines,5,hong kong airlines customer review,shanghai pudonghong kong then hong kongshanghai hongqiao both on a330200 and delayed more than 1 hour seat comfortable and avod with a few movies cabin crew young and lack of experience no newspaper provided like kacx food awful and very tiny size the only reason i fly with hx is their low airfare between shanghai and hong kong
15569,onur air,5,onur air customer review,used the stanstead to ercan route and returned a week later although i can have no complaints whatsoever about the crew or the flights i have strong reservations about the very cramped seating on both journeys i am just over 6 feet tall and found myself in considerable pain from having little or no leg room although it was not the airlines fault the return journey was made worse by taking over 105 minutes in line waiting to check in at ercan whilst staff hand wrote the boarding passes and luggage labels it left us with barely 10 minutes to shop before rushing onto the aircraft which then spent over an hour on the ground in turkey as it was an early morning flight over 200 disgruntled people finally left the cramped plane i had a great holiday in a northern cyprus but would never want to repeat the experience of bad seating and rubbish checking in procedures i will look elsewhere in future
16448,qantaslink,8,will fly qantaslink and this route again,i have flown this service before it is a quick flight between the 2 major regional cities in the north approx 45 min flying time cutting down around a 3 to 4 hour drive there is no classes available and whilst you could select your seat it was on a first come first served basis the plane was full only a few empty seats so no opportunities to move seats it is mostly workers commuting between the cities or to connecting charter flights for mining we were slightly late on take off due to the catering being late the catering company also failed to deliver the alcohol so they made the decision to leave without it we did however land on time i cant blame the airline for this but i was looking forward to having a glass of wine they provided an inflight snack manna from heaven which was a small box of 3 x bite sized snacks very tasty your choice of soft drink considering the flight time was so short the cabin staff did well to serve the whole cabin do a rubbish collection and then we were ready for descent the cabin crew were courteous and efficient but nothing jumped out to me as a wow the cabin and seats themselves are very tight and not a lot of room i would imagine it would very uncomfortable for a tall or large person i am only 5 ft especially of the flight was longer then 1 hour the cabin was clean there is no entertainment provided or wifi aboard but again for such a short hop it isnt needed i will fly qantaslink and this route again
7234,cityjet,6,cityjet customer review,wx120 from dub to lcy 27th may and wx121 from lcy to dub on 28th may i agree with previous reviewer call this progress and a wonderful message from the ceo on how the split will only mean improved services the website is a joke for checking in whoever designed this knows nothing about enduser experience you used to be able to print a boarding card at lcy by just using your passport now you need the booking ref hence the number of people standing at the booths scrolling through emails on their smartphone ugh no more sky priority on my boarding card which got me through the fast lane at security and when i asked re ff program there are no plans yet to introduce one yet roll on the alternative
16055,phuket air,2,phuket air customer review,intrigued by fern tuppens comments below we were on the same lgwbkk plane on the 24 february and condition wise the cabin was dirty and scruffy torn and stained seat covers and staff service was offhand to say the least are the staff the thai airways rejects because they really do not come close to the thai standards i agree about the flights not being full and have heard rumours that phuket air will have to cut these long haul flights because it is crippling the airline to keep losing money i would not repeat the experience even though i admit it was cheap i do have real concerns for the maintenance and safety standards for this outfit and fear the worst has yet to come for them
21237,turkish airlines,2,think twice about flying with turkish airlines,my luggage was left in newark and didnt get it 2 days after new year and 5 days after i arrived the contents were new year presents to my family it was difficult to touch base with their office in manila the baggage services from dnata helped me a lot and asked them to please tell the person in charge of lost baggage in turkish airlines to communicate with me when i applied for a refund for my expenses to collect the luggage i was told that they only allow 21 days to do this upon receipt of the item i would like to remind turkish airlines that people travel for different reasons and mine was to spend time with my 87 year old mother do you think i have the time to read the fine print of their carriage rules nobody from their office informed me of this when i filed a complaint about my luggage i would think twice about flying with turkish airlines again
20410,thomas cook airlines scandinavia,7,thomas cook airlines scandinavia customer review,arlanda to marsa alam return all things considered it was better than the tui equivalent where our 25 and 7 year olds were only offered coffee or tea no water as a beverage for paid meals staff were friendly food looked great we packed our own and no price gouging on the drinks service
22616,wamos air,3,one has to buy the fooddrinks,chicago to gatwick flight with norwegian was operated by wamos air and was absolutely horrible at the checkin that we couldnt complete online we had to wait forty minutes one of the employees wasnt very focused and got confused with our luggage as well as the boarding passespassports we did not know one has to buy the fooddrinks all staff spoke a lot of spanish and avoided the contact with the passengers as much as possible one stewardess was so rude that even passengers next to us complained you can only pay with credit card no other paying method is available the staff didnt distribute water for several hours and said that we had to go back and ask them earpods werent included and cost 3 dollars a pack the tv program didnt offer a wide range of programs and my touchscreen hardly reacted i changed seat because the one i got first was even more uncomfortable

2763,air serbia,1,only refunded me for airport taxes,i bought a ticket for 1806 however as i was prevented from traveling corona virus i had to postpone the flight for 0207 i called the call center and they said i had to pay 90e because of the price difference in the meantime i had to reschedule the flight for 0907 and again to pay another 50eur due to the impossibility of traveling i wanted to postpone the flight again but since i no longer knew for which date i wanted to leave the ticket open and use it until the end of this year which they did not allow and i had to choose another date and pay 50eur again in the end i did not want to pay for the postponement of the ticket again and i asked for a refund i paid 300eur for the ticket and they only refunded me 55eur for airport taxes i couldnt get the rest of the money because the flight was operational btw they dont reply to emails and the call center can hardly be reached
11269,iberia express,9,easy departure and punctuality,stuttgart to madrid cabin crew friendlier than customers wifi to see movies on the cellphone easy departure and punctuality finger use in airports never had to use a bus to get to the plane it does not seem a lowcost airline at all and i try to use it whenever i can the only but is that the cabin crew are too permissive with customers leaving their backpacks in the trolleycabins if you get late to the plane you might not have space because of this
10969,hi fly,2,cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything,we returned from holguin on flight 5k2817 run by hifly this company was drafted in to replace the original thomas cook flight mt2817 the flight was due to take off at 1700 but we didnt start boarding until nearly 1700 like most people we didnt rush as we had boarding passes with allocated seat numbers some people had also paid more for extra leg room seats as we boarded the plane the cabin crew told us to just sit anywhere this led to chaos and contributed to the delays in taking off a storm then rolled in and at 1755 the captain confirmed that we wouldnt be taking off there was no further information until 1839 when he announced that there a was sick child on board and asked for assistance at 1908 a thomas cookcondor plane landed in the storm at 1931 the captain announced that the child and parents would be leaving the plane but it wasnt until 1958 that the baggage belt arrived to start removing the bags at 2046 the captain announced that we would finally be leaving at 2050 the thomas cook plane took off ahead of us at 2121 we finally took off 45 hours after boarding the cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything not even the seating we heard of several fights breaking out and there could well have been many more the seats were cramped and there was no leg room the selfish person in front of me pushed their seat back resulting in absolutely no leg room at all my knees were crushed against the back of their seat for over 8 hours there is no way i could have placed myself into the brace position see image i pointed this out to the cabin crew who as usual couldnt care less there was no entertainment at all and the only food offered was a roll with very little inside it the only drink offered by the crew was water however we discovered 6 hours into the flight that hot drinks were available near the back none of the crew bothered to tell us and we had to get up and get it ourselves this is without doubt the worst flight were have ever had to endure the whole experience had left us reluctant to fly again hifly should not be used as a replacement service again they simply arent up to the standards required for even basic air travel their planes are cramped underequipped and the staff are either undertrained or just couldnt give a damn

12953,korean air,7,food and beverages are delicious,the airport was clean and fresh the ground service is nice and boarding is easy welcoming food and beverages are delicious and fresh and the pillow and blanket included on the seats are comfortable entertainment is a bit outdated no close captions for english the flight attendants do not fulfill requests sometimes
21604,uzbekistan airways,6,uzbekistan airways customer review,if you book your flight in tashkent you get what you pay for basic service that will get you from a to b with no frills however if you book your flight outside of uzbekistan the flight prices are ridiculous i regularly fly lhrtaslhr if i have my ticket booked in tashkent it costs approx 350 return if booked in london costs me about 550 from the airline i take great issue with the check in at heathrow there are 3 check in desks to check in about 300 people many of those 300 speak little or no english which makes the process more prolonged and agonising there is a screen that says tashkent business class check in this isnt used for business class only and even those paying a premium price can expect to wait up to 2 hours to check in boarding is as expected everyone pushes but my experience has been that everyone sits in their allocated seats inflight entertainment is poor seats are comfortable and cleanliness is acceptable staff vary from helpful to uncooperative a bribe can be paid 50100 to cabin crew to sit in business class
20898,transavia,3,used napkins in pocket,online checkin wasnt possible because of codeshare flight transaviaklm used napkins in pocket in front of me and broken closing of air conditioner almost froze me and other passengers around me
9717,flyadeal,5,wheelchair was not arranged,riyadh to jeddah it was low cost carrier so had to pay for baggage and snacks price of checkin baggage if bought at time of checkingin was as high as 100 sar per baggage piece ie 50 of total fare even upon request wheelchair was not arranged but some how ground handling staff arranged it from some other airline snacks price were bit high during flight upon landing at jeddah there were no jet bridges so i requested ambulator medical lift which they clearly denied that they cannot call and ambulator for me so had to use stairs to hop off the aircraft in my personal opinion it is a cruel act luckily i can walk with sticks but what about passengers who are completely dependant upon wheel chair
11869,japan airlines,8,attendants were incredible,my first flight was from vancouver to tokyo and i was so disappointed in the business class not having full lay flat seats and having to step over the passenger beside me every time i had to go to the washroom the service was mediocre at best i felt like it was premium economy what saved japan airlines for me was the flight from tokyo to delhi it was like night and day the seats are 121 configuration so you have a lot of privacy the seats had lots of storage space and the tv was huge the flight attendants were incredible always walking by to see if we needed anything and the bathroom was clean i dont know why there was such a big difference in the flights but japan airlines is now my second favorite after eva air but beware as some planes are still the old horrible configuration
16619,qatar airways,4,waiting for the driver to deliver it,the first leg from dc to doha was on the 777200er with 343 configuration in economy which is an awful set up my food was inedible but service as always was excellent i flew business class on the doha to denpasar route on a boeing 777300er it was an excellent flight even if entertainment options were limited then they informed me they failed to load my baggage in doha it was a 10 hour layover and they couldnt get my bag loaded they informed it arrived at denpasar hours later and said they were waiting for the driver to deliver it and then nothing it is 8 hours later and no update or response no luggage
9333,fiji airways,2,could not answer any questions,we were told there would be a one hour delay for 9 pm departure at the end of that 1 hour we were told there be another hour delay at the end of that hour we were told there would be another hour delay because we were changing planes we received only 1 communication per hour and no explanation until the last announcement when finally boarding we were told that due to the late nature of our flight that their own booking people would be rebooking all of our connecting flights for us and they would be waiting at the gate in la with our new flights and boarding passes that was a lie it did not happen all of us ended up having to go through rebooking in la after exiting customs and security and nobody from fiji airways in la had any idea why we were there most of our connecting flights were all missed and we were on our own booking connecting flights with 2 overwhelmed fiji air people at every point where they said they would have things fixed for us they lied their gate staff at nadi were completely clueless and could not answer any questions
7214,cityjet,5,cityjet customer review,just returned from a weekend in amsterdam flying out of london city airport flight was fine for a short flight and the location of city airport was convenient was disappointed by how they handled the large volume of cabin trolley cases on both outward and return flights on the way out of london nothing was said until my friend and i boarded the plane and there was no space left in the overhead lockers for our trolley cases both of which were standard cabin size this was the case for a number of passengers and it was inconvenient as we were told that we had to take them to the front of the plane for them to be put in the hold which caused difficulties as passengers were trying to get down the aisle in opposing directions on the return flight out of schipol as we queued at the gate to get on the plane they saw that about 1012 of the passengers at the front of the queue including us and told us that we would have to hand our baggage in to be placed in the hold what bothered me was that after we took our seats we saw people coming onto the place after us who had trolley cases bigger than ours so it seemed unfair that some of the passengers were treated differently
6573,cathay pacific airways,3,was given the worst seat,worst airline ive flown with economy seat seated in front of the toilet last row and given the last option i requested for window or aisle and not in front of the toilet but was given the worst seat i ever had ever since i traveled to anywhere staff are unfriendly and one of the worst meal from hong kong to narita crew at the back are very loud before take off they need to have a serious customer service training seats are worn out
8631,el al israel airlines,9,very nice business class,london to tel aviv fresh new boeing 7879 with very nice business class seat configuration is 1x2x1 seat is very conformable with wide screen and very good entertainment system kit was nice with ferragamo brand kit the seats is isolated with direct access to aisle team was very good and professional
1299,air canada rouge,7,better than i was expecting,toronto to montego bay morning flight delayed by an hour premium rouge class seat 1a was better than i was expecting decent leg room breakfast consisting of fruit and oatmeal tasty and cabin staff friendly and attentive compared to my return leg via westjet premium rouge premium was a close second would consider a second trip with them although i wont recommend to others due to an over abundance of negative reviews and i think i may have just got lucky id need some further travel using rouge
6320,bulgaria air,9,bulgaria air customer review,overall satisfied very friendly and professional crew good onboard service the only thing which can be pointed out as negative are the old british aerospace plains which operate the internal flights small and crowded recently have spotted the new embraer 190 jets i am sure this will improve the overall quality of their fleet
18692,south african airways,9,best crew ive had to date,livingstone to johannesburg my 40th flight on saa in the last 15 months or so and i must say this was the best crew ive had to date flawless service engaging purser the captain even made his announcement in german as there were germans on board saa has challenges but once up in the air their service is consistently good and a positive attitude from all the crew
14375,mahan air,8,overall a good flight,mahan air from kuala lumpur to tehran check in was fast and friendly the signage to find the premier lounge in kuala lumpur airport was almost nonexistent and took me a while to locate the lounge which offered minimum amenities boarding was efficient and the a340600 was packed for this flight the aircraft interior was new and clean with smiling crew the flat bed was great and plenty of food was offered for this 8 hour flight perhaps the refreshment pizza and a burrito at the end of the flight was a bit too much only negative thing i can think of was not much entertainment and it was limited to public lcds considering the business class fare was almost 40 cheaper than other airlines which operated indirect service it was a good buy i was especially impressed by the very attentive flight attendants overall a good flight
17740,scoot,4,next time will pay extra,we flew with scoot on our singaporesydney route on the way back from the uk which we booked through singapore airlines however we were disappointed we paid a little bit extra for a scoot in silence seat which was like a small economy area where children werent allowed food was pretty terrible but included however drinks were not included except for water we had brought our own water on board but had to pay for any extra drinks which i wasnt happy about no entertainment system so come prepared with your own devices i wouldnt fly scoot again and next time will pay extra to fly with singapore airlines the whole way
6581,cathay pacific airways,4,a true disappointment,i had high expectations but it is a true disappointment the flight delayed the cabin was not clean the flight attendant were tired and demotivated no accessories like eye blinds earplugs my food was terrible and seats were very uncomfortable
21724,vietnam airlines,6,it did not disappoint,first time trying this 4 star airline and based on the prices it charged it did not disappoint first flight to ho chi minh city was in a a350 with 121 lie flat staggered seats the seats were visibly narrower than the boeing 787s reverse herringbone seats food was almost inedible but since the changi airport terminal 4 lounge was quite good we did not mind once in ho chi minh city the 3rd floor lounge was filled to the brim and we were brought to a first floor lounge food was below par except for spring rolls second sector in boeing 787s reverse herringbone 121 full flat seats very similar to finnairs slept ok all flights were on time and we even arrived in london 45 mins earlier than schedule on each flight there was 23 very attentive fa with the others being less helpful more training needed did not take the supper but breakfasts was tasty albeit too small portions toilets not as clean entertainment not as varied with only about 5 chinese movies overall recommended to give this airline a try keep on improving vietnam airlines
6957,china eastern airlines,6,tickets were extremely cheap,flew with china eastern from gatwick to bali via shanghai and back to heathrow flight from gatwick was poor compared to the flight back to heathrow on the return leg the food was good and flight attendants attentive however the flight from gatwick could be much improved we were served food within an hour of departure and then didnt see the flight attendants again until two hours before we landed an almost 8 hour absence no snacks no water 8 hours flight to bali on old a330 no entertainment and again limited fa presence however tickets were extremely cheap and so long as you stock up with water and snacks before the flight it is worth travelling with them for the cheap tickets
18235,singapore airlines,6,rather disappointed,the first suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets and some fellow travelers might be impressed i was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite the bed is not in the direction of the travel but across the suite it is narrow and very hard if the bed is in the nonsleeping position then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood in order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite which is not very private when as in my case the door does not close properly on both legs to and from sydney there were technical issues in the suite either the door could not be closed properly or the entertainment system did not work at all or not properly the seat belt did not fit into the mattress etc to add as well that singapore airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer only the caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of first class food on my way to singapore i have enjoyed swiss and their first class product for a frequent traveller their product was first class all over only with the exception of the bathroom
17249,ryanair,3,selling food and lotto tickets rather than concentrating on safety,boarding was the normal scramble with people rushing to get into line at the gate and wanting to be first on total waste of time and money paying for priority boarding when you have allocated seats quick turn around meant aircraft hadnt been cleaned crisps and biscuits all over the floor around the seat normal crew members more interested in selling food and lotto tickets rather than concentrating on safety real concern was the fact those sat in the overwing exit row two rows in front of us had plastic pint glasses full of beer they were drinking from during approach landing and taxi at gatwick so much for the so called final cabin checks
10196,garuda indonesia,7,without delay or any problems,i flew with garuda indonesia from jakarta to singapore return i booked this flight a month in advance the flight to singapore on went smooth without delay or any problems the female flight attendant who served meal was polite and professional the meal was mee goreng and was a decent meal the plane arrived on time the flight from singapore to jakarta on was the opposite the female flight attendant was impolite and unfriendly towards me my meal was bad pad thai the plane arrived about 10 minutes late
809,air arabia,3,very poor customer service,gatwick to tangier missed my flight in this airline and another flight was cancelled contacted them regarding refunds and claiming the airport taxes and duties for the flight i missed no luck they never replied to my emails they not interested at all very poor customer services

7115,china united airlines,8,china united airlines customer review,beijing nanyuan to hohhot china united is the only airline that uses beijing nanyuan a former military airport in the south of beijing the airport is easy to get to and flights in and out of nanyuan do not seem to be subject to delays as serious as those at beijing capital theres also very little taxiing checkin was quick easy but the checkin area is noisy and dilapidated toilets at the airport werent great the flight was on a newish 737 and the plane was clean service was friendly and the bacon wrap for breakfast was actually very nice takeoff and arrival were both on schedule id use china united again just to avoid the delays at beijing capital
8605,el al israel airlines,5,poor for a premium airline,nice to tel aviv old 737 that was refurbished very nicely looked like new all seats and cabin are new real business class with recline seats and all the rest is economy gate and counter location is awful no place to seat super busy and feels like low cost the crew was ok not more than that as el al recently pulled out serving food on eu flights they have very poor salad or sandwich poor not enough for a 4h flight and very uncomfortable security checkin el al asked to arrive airport 3h before departure add the fact the nice airport is very small and so at the end the entire tour is very long a wrong move and poor for a premium airline
16813,rossiya airlines,2,totally not worth it,bangkok to moscow with rossiya airlines not the worst airline i flown with but far from good for the money they charge service shouldve been much better food was average seat comfort was none didnt get any sleep plane was packed overcrowded and even in these conditions the price for the ticket was outrageous because of that virus situation it was the only airline flying and they knew it so the price was unreasonable im pretty disappointed mostly because of how much money ive spent on this ticket totally not worth it
17128,royal jordanian airlines,3,very bad experience,jeddah to chicago via amman very bad experience the workers in this airline are not politethey over charged me on the 2nd luggage when i get to the airport i got charged 250 and no body to talk to in their website it is 200 but they make me pay 250 bad service in the grand and air bad experience
17205,rwandair,5,id recommend this airline,cape town to harare rwandair recently started flying directly from cape town to harare and the convenience made me book them this airline is surprisingly good an up and coming african airline which well be sure to hear more of in future the cabin interior is spotless and all staff friendly and efficient the inflight catering and entertainment are average ive flown this route a few times now and they seem to have a problem with delays of over an hour each time on this route whenever ive flown advance communication of delays were lacking each time overall id recommend this airline if youre on a budget and dont mind the occasional delay
1732,air france,6,need to feel welcomed and pampered,air france business class mauritius to paris boeing 777 recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me meal selection was limited forgot to serve me dessert when asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin when asking for a napkin i was given a large table cloth for breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals you need to feel welcomed and pampered this was not the case for air france crew on this flight
2172,air malta,1,no help whatsoever,our terrible time with air malta started with baggage checkin we bought our tickets through expedia and they just said economy turns out air malta has like 5 different ticket types and the one we had didnt have checked baggage we didnt know this in advance but whatever we payed to checkin our luggage we were traveling as a group of 3 and my friend was in a wheelchair because her leg was broken she has been in a full cast up to her knee for over a month on our way to malta from israel on flight air malta 829 that departed sunday morning apr 14 2019 at 7 am my friend was questioned about her cast how long shes had it and if shes cleared to fly we answered all of their questions told them the cast was a month old and that the doctors cleared her to fly in the end of this questioning we were all allowed to board and the israeli ground stewardess even found my friend a row of seats so that she could elevate her leg comfortably on our way back from malta to israel on flight air malta 828 that departed friday morning apr 18 2019 at 1 am my friend was giving the same round of questions except that this time they declared she was unfit to fly and that their doctor said it would be very dangerous for my friend to fly with a full cast it did not help that we told them we flew with there airline 5 days ago and that she was fine they said that this was a mistake and she should never have been let on the first flight to begin with or that we had papers in hebrew proving my friends cast was at least several weeks old nothing helped they told us she had to go to a clinic in malta to get her cast cut so that it was a half and not full cast and that we were wasting our time my 2 traveling companions got in a cab and went to go get the cast cut in a foreign country where we knew nothing of the healthcare system this would have been fine but the clinic they sent us do didnt have the equipment to cut the cast so that trip was a waste when we asked what we could do if their own recommendation didnt pan out and they said that my friend would have to stay to get her cast cut at the hospital we tried to find out from the maltese air malta manager if there would be any kind of compensation since they would not let my fried on the plane could they transfer her ticket book her a hotel for her extra overnight stay we were given a negative response on both counts and she told us that it was stated clearly in the air malta rules that you cannot fly with a full cast we searched for a while for these alleged rules and couldnt find them only general airline guidelines that said you shouldnt fly within a few days of getting a cast so this was our problem when we tried to find out what else we could do and if we could maybe get the hospital that treated my friend to send an email in english that cleared her to fly the manager speaking to us was very rude said she was repeating herself and just walked away since the 3rd traveling companion and i could not afford to wait any longer or buy new tickets we left my friend in a cast with her wheelchair and crutches to stay alone overnight and try and book another flight air malta was obviously no help whatsoever in the end my friend got a doctors letter in english saying she was cleared to fly and booked herself a flight back to israel through another airline company with a layover in vienna so this was not the most convenient flight
10979,hi fly,7,operated my norwegian flight,hifly operated my norwegian flight from paris cdg to los angeles the premium class seats were very comfortable however inflight entertainment was limited and not on par with that of major carriers meals were very average although the flight attendants were all polite and professional id be open to flying them again only if the ticket price was substantially below that of the legacy carriers

12515,jetstar japan,3,dont understand why she wanted to be difficult,osaka to manila with jetstar japan first counter lady tells me i canceled our seat reservation i objected and showed payment for the choice seats after much insisting she eventually relented and issued my seats next she tells me my carry on luggage was too big i argued that it was a standard size bag she brings it to the steel frame to show it wouldnt fit i followed and showed her that it could fit she let us through with the warning it was up to the gate when we got to the gate she was there and she took out a tape measure and this time says the height didnt pass after much arguing i just agreed to have it checked in even if so many other passengers had same size bags that were allowed even the bag of the fa was same size i dont understand why she wanted to be difficult
14165,lufthansa,6,worst in flight experience,i have been a loyal customer of lufthansa both for economy and business flights for over 16 years being my second preference after swiss flying longhaul with them for the first time after the pandemic how things have changed it was the worst in flight experience the hardest seats one can possibly imagine for an 11h flight terrible food and in the smallest quantities no snacks no fruit for in between and the entertainment console i could not even imagine something this terrible can exist in 2023 it was touch screen but mostly an instrument of torture for your fingers and the slowest thing one can imagine not too great of a selection either paid internet available obviously their safety record is great and i am happy they got me to my destination safe and on time but it would have been nice if they did it with a bit more comfort i am really disappointed to see what was a really great airline to fall so low in terms of service
9760,flydubai,3,seats were so uncomfortable,the highlight of this flight was the cabin crew kind friendly available to assist us amine and vladimir are 5 stars the breakfast served was ok but the seats were so uncomfortable the seats are so tight that the screen is right in your face and if the person in front of you decides to recline its seat you will be inside the screen after 2h i couldnt find a comfortable position to be seated my back and my neck hurt definitely an experience not to repeat
2109,air madagascar,3,forthcoming with meals and accommodation,flew sainte marie to antananarivo with air madagascar online this looks to be an airline of last resort but i found myself requiring their services at the end of a holiday in madagascar i wasnt totally surprised when my flight was cancelled and the replacement flight the next day ran 2 hours late to their credit they were very forthcoming with meals and accommodation while we were stranded

15784,peach aviation,3,peach aviation customer review,to those who complain about european lcs i would recommend a japanese lc as peach to see that easyjet or ryanair are not as bad as they look our flight an a320 was so late on arrival to taipei and departure from taipei that we landed at midnight in kix immigration customs no more transportation available out of airport which is on an island peach did not take any measures at least advising taxis and we were just dropped off in an empty airport they had their profit they did not care as they had apologized for the delay peach sells a taipeiosaka 650 flight which is late in nearly 70 of the cases it always arrives close to the last buses out of osaka airport they know it but risk is at passengers expenses
15659,openskies,8,openskies customer review,value for money this was one of the best airline experiences ive had check in on both sides was fine the premium plus with an equivalent fair to most airlines economy comfort was a far better value definitely more room and more comfortable seating than comparable airlines offerings while their fleet of 757s are not new and not glamorous it was better than most international business class of 5 to 10 years ago considering you only pay a couple of hundred dollars more then a regular coach sardine class and 23000 less in business class it is hard to beat this airline also the fact that fly to orly as opposed to charles de gaulle makes transportation into the center of paris much more economic
15573,onur air,3,onur air customer review,we flew from stansted and got there early to book extra leg room my husbands tall and requires this for three months both thomas cook and ourselves have been trying to book extra leg room with this airline the telephone number published isnt answered and the system throws you out repeatedly just when you think you are nearly there and are about to pay for seats journey to antalya was great as a result our return was a nightmare once again we got to the airport early paid for row one 4 seats at 2000 per seat fine if thats what it takes to be comfy we were happy when boarding our seats were changed to row 2 but we had paid for row 1 they said sorry but these had been prebooked this service didnt exist as a result we waited for our refund and my husband flew in the tightest space possible his knees were into the chair in front are the pitches aimed at five footers he was so uncomfortable as a result we came home with a bitterness about the holiday and the airline
18452,skymark airlines,7,comfy seat and legroom,tokyo haneda to sapporo return with skymark airlines first leg on boeing 737800ng new cabin comfy seat and generous legroom for a lowcost airline even though i didnt purchase any the drinks and snakcs are sold at a cheap price departure and arrival on time return leg delayed for 30 mins due to congestion at destination airport return aircraft was an older boeing 737800 very warm cabin temperature but overall worth the ticket price definetely better than airasia and jetstar

4588,asiana airlines,3,they forgot to serve my bread,the passenger experience has worsened beyond imagination even though i was being seated in business had little expectation for asianas product as their fleet is aging without much refurbishment but now it seems that the flight crew is losing it they forgot to serve my bread until the end of the meal in business class
17990,sichuan airlines,3,smelled cigarette smoke,chengdu to hong kong i liked the staff but twice i smelled cigarette smoke i complained and the staff did nothing about it she just explained it away saying it comes from the outside while on the tarmac the second incidence occurred while in flight
8392,edelweiss air,6,overall a good carrier,my wife and i travelled from cape town to barcelona via zurich in november 2017 with our 8 month old baby on edelweiss swiss air my review is in connection with the longhaul flights between cape town and zurich edelweiss is overall a good carrier the aircraft was new clean and engendered trust in the airline however there are two points which the airline has to improve upon accommodating babies on the cape town to zurich leg there was insufficient time to book a seat at the bulkhead with a bassinet however the cape town ground crew assisted us and upgraded us to economy max which provided us with bulkhead seating and a bassinet for our baby to sleep in which was appreciated and not expected however upon our return trip which ironically was when we had the foresight to try to book a bulkhead seat in normal economy we found that in trying to book a bulkhead seat and a bassinet both on the website and via email correspondence the airline did not accommodate us we even paid 58chf to secure 2 seats however there were no bulkhead seats available and no provision for parents with babies who actually need those bulkhead seats due to the bassinet facilities upon arrival at both barcelona and zurich airports on return to cape town the ground crew would not or could not help us we therefore had to travel 12 hours with a baby on our lap between zurich and cape town and noted that the bulkhead seats were not occupied by people with babies a most uncomfortable arrangement with airline crew not assisting in making it any more easy for us or offering more suitable seating with a bassinet it is totally unacceptable that no provision is made for booking with infants on the website or via email we did send an email about 3 days prior to our trip but this was only answered upon retuning to cape town not acceptable the boarding system is chaotic not only in cape town but barcelona and zurich everyone rushes at the same time to board the aircraft upon announcement of boarding why does the airline not look at what singapore airlines or other airlines do in boarding in a systematic and orderly fashion thereby reducing an anxious and chaotic boarding process they are a swiss airline after all one would expect it ironically upon getting into the aircraft the aircrew constantly harass passengers with an announcement basically saying that passengers much step aside and get in their seats as soon as possible to allow other passengers to board surely if they instituted an orderly boarding system this would actually be far more efficient and this announcement would be unnecessary
18685,south african airways,2,shall not recommend saa,johannesburg to lodon we booked the flight and also made advanced seat selection seats 55h and 55 k more leg space on 3d of august reason is that i am 190 m long on the flight sa 234 on friday the 11th from johannesburg the airline has changed the type of airplane they did not inform us before by email whattapp on there own saapp and also not at the counterdesk where we put our luggage therefore we paid for nothing and other people were sitting the staff of sa in the plain didnt do anything to help us and only said you can get your extra seat costs back at the counter in londonwe didnt have a chance to upgrade or change our seats we could not go to the counter because we had a connecting flight 1 hour later to schiphol amsterdamit was very disappointed i have sent an email to sa customer services directly but did not receive any reply till now on top of that a staffmember suddenly came in the plane with a insectide in aerosol and sprayed us all it was a disaster total no feeling to the client i shall not recommend saa to anybody
237,aer lingus,6,a lowcost basic experience,there was nothing wrong with the flight itself perse it took off and landed on time generally calm terminal 2 security at heathrow was calm although amenities and shops quite poor since boots closed you cant buy water anywhere for less than 2 which is extortionate boarding felt a bit early but we didnt take off at departure time as it was quite slow this was because there was only one gate agent checking in everyone including premium passengers and those requiring assistance although automatic gates were used seats were above average comfortable for shorthaul on the way our was oldstyle so more padding and quite comfortable but on the way back was slimline but fine for an hours flight time strangely the seat pocket in front had been sewn up so no where to store small belongings which felt a tad lowcost despite the premium prices charged for this flight cabincrew werent especially warm and friendly and seemed rather unmotivated they did pass through the cabin quickly offering the buyonboard snacks and drinks but no menu was offered and it was almost like it was just a formality and seemed a bit surprised or putout that some people actually wanted any like my neighbour in my seat buyonboard products didnt look good quality from looking online felt very expensive for what they were in comparison to other carriers my biggest issue though is aer lingus charge quite a premium to fly with them against the only other carrier they compete with between the two cities so theyre not anywhere near cheap yet it feels like a lowcost basic experience i think even a complimentary snack and some water is the least the should offer as their sister airline ba now do in shorthaul economy given the premium charge i would fly with them again only if they were the only better option as on this route
21701,vietnam airlines,2,told me that i wont get any refund,i booked a flight with vietnam airlines before the covid crisis as so many flights it got cancelled not their fault at all they offered me a rebooking which i had to pay an additional fee for now they cancelled my second flight too and told me that i wont get any refund not even a voucher this is unacceptable they keep my money make me pay a fee for a flight change and now keep that too
6164,brussels airlines,3,below the standards of other airlines,check in was smooth and arrival and departure on time cabin crew was cool and uninterested we sat at the first row and had a bit more legroom but seat pitch of the entire cabin is the same standard economy seat pitch no difference in seat between business and economy as well as no divider curtain only a movable sign marked economy placed on the back of the last business class seat meal wasnt great but at least better than what it used to be until recent with the uninspired foodmaker cardboard boxes only good thing is they serve real champagne its a cheap one but its drinkable though and you get a small box of neuhaus chocolates given the price paid not really value for money and overall below the standards of other airlines on european routes in business class
7480,copa airlines,8,flight was nice,panama city to bogota flight was nice at the gate i asked for a better seat and gave us exit service with chips and drinks on a short flight and even inflight entertainment only drawback had 30 mins delay waited for connecting passengers
19498,swoop,1,why pay for a seat,my experience with this airline has not been good first off they cancelled my flight but agreed to move the date to another day and lucky for me i was flexible i paid for my seats both ways and when i checked in the seat i paid for was correct and was listed on my boarding pass 2f when i got to the gate and i went to board she said that was not my seat and they had no more window seats im like how can that be she had no answer i was super angry because why pay for a seat when they just give it away
20729,tigerair australia,3,rude and unpleasant experience,sydney to melbourne when travelling to sydney the experience was okay however flying from sydney to melbourne the supervisor checking in the bags at weight scale was rude she started questioning me are u going to feel that cold that you are carrying a jacket i was like its going to be cold in melbourne at night and she was embarrassing me in front of other passengers i was happy to pay and already paid extra but there is a way to treat your customers this is was such a rude and unpleasant experience

10370,germanwings,7,cabin crew were very friendly,flew from dublin to rome via cologne on germanwings website booking is very efficient and due to my fare type i was able to select seat 1d for both flights check in was smooth and all flights left on time again due to fare type i was given a sandwich coffee and bottled water on both flights and the cabin crew were very friendly and professional transfer in cologne was extremely efficient with no need to reclear security and a small and compact airport baggage claim in rome was a zoo but i would blame rome tourism in july for that all in all a very positive experience on germanwings and connecting in cologne would by no means turn me away from flying them again
16557,qatar airways,8,was well pampered,flight on time smooth cooperation with their partner rwandair by whom i arrived with in doha early morning coming from kigali luggage transfer went smooth arrived quickly in hanoi in doha i had 12 hours layover i was eventually denied a hotel stay but had lounge access to their decent platinum lounge onboard recognised as elite traveller and was well pampered by professional attendants they secured me 3 seats in a row by applying seatblock for me as elite flier the plane was not fully occupied as this is a new additional flight on this route ife of high class and movies renewed frequently food onboard improving for qr 3 offerings at dinner of which i had two dishes of beef which was excellent beers were of ridiculous poor quality wines were fair including a sparkling spanish cava the wineglasses are so small that they embarrass the passengers they hold 58 cl only the wineglasses on my previous flight rwandair are 4 times larger amenity kit given though rather useless a hot snack was offered before morning landing in hanoi recommended cant demand much more for economy class but bring onboard your own slippers and headset qatar airways tickets have become too expensive during corona
12219,jetblue airways,5,they lost this customer,my review is about jet blues administrative policys i spent hours picking out the right flight that met my needs for our vacation a few weeks after booking jet blue cancels my flight and assigns me another flight this new flight the picked for me was awful i would miss a whole days vacation because my original flight landed at 10am and new flight landed at 1115 pm to my destination my return flight switched from getting me home on a sunday to a redeye arriving home on a monday just didnt fit my needs and obviously a cheaper flight than i had booked jetblue allows you one change however they had no flights nonstop going to and from my destination i called an agent to try and work things out however things went from bad to worst they would refund my money but they would only put the money in a jetblue bank that i could use one for one year i didnt think this was fair since they made the change and now i was stuck trying to make jet blue work for me i didnt want to leave money in a bank that i had to use within a year this was my money and they made the change not me i had to rebook on different days and no longer was there a non stop option they all had at least one stop and a 6 hour trip each way turned into a 10 plus hour trip just what i was trying to avoid i feel like jet blue is a bunch of thieves stealing my money and then charging me more money for an inferior flight spoke with supervisor and really worthless got the standard line of this is our policy whatever happened to treat the customer with respect and make them happy not so in this airlines i have been a loyal customer for years but lately last three trips things have been going wrong and this is the third time my flights were cancelled after taking so much time to plan jet blue needs a new business plan because they lost this customer
20484,thomson airways,7,kindness and consideration,tenerife south to birmingham with thomson airways the aisle seat in the row in which my wife were sitting was occupied by an elderly disabled lady my reason for writing the review is the kindness and consideration shown by the cabin staff who were very friendly to this lady

6766,cebu pacific,7,they could improve the website,solid airline for locals i avoided it until they had a very good prices to fly domestically however felt the warm flight staff seats arent as small as other domestic flights i am very happy with the flight itself i think what they could improve on is the website side and helping people claim their vouchers
9619,flair airlines,3,behavior was so abrasive rude and abusive,after being told that our 2 bags of chips and cashews would be fine to take on the plane by the first check in attendant while trying to go through the last check in at the terminal we were told that we would have to pay the carry on fee my husband then proceeded to pack the snack items in his personal item and was yelled at and harassed in front of the remaining passengers telling him that was not acceptable to put the items in his personal bag when there was plenty of space for them we left the snacks behind and made our way down the ramp when she then followed my husband yelling forcing him to apologize for his behavior in order for us to board her behavior was so abrasive rude and abusive i have never experienced that before in all my years of flying she was so focused on our snacks that she didnt check my husbands boarding pass and passport delaying takeoff as they had to ensure he was on the plane great start to the morning
4004,allegiant air,2,not worth any amount of savings,disaster third time wasnt a charm got delayed in tsa mess and no attendants at the gate was there 18 minutes prior to the flight departure staff came out from the locked door and said they had a jam up in the jetway couldnt get in as they closed the door behind them watched the plane pull away for 18 minutes ive had three flights cancelled now sitting on hold for 30 minutes so far just to get a flight credit worth nothing avoid these people not worth any amount of savings
1333,air canada rouge,5,premium seats very comfortable,while the premium seats extra legroom in rows 13 to 15 were very comfortable the real irritation was with the air canada rouge player i tried to watch two movies on my return flight to toronto on august 16 both movies cut out at various places in the movie i waited patiently for the buffering circle to take me back to the movie where it was interrupted but neither movie came on i had to exit the air canada app reenter the app reenter the rouge player and try to fast forward to where each movie was interrupted i gave up on the first movie thinking there was something particularly wrong with that movie same thing happed with my second move i had to exit and reenter the player over 10 times i stopped counting at 10 in this day and age an airline like ac rouge which forces you to use an wifi player to access entertainment you would think they could get it right and make the experience seamless enjoyable and not irritating this ruined my flight never had this problem on westjet which uses a similar wifi player on its app
16153,play,8,would definitely fly again,pros great price comfortable plane nice staff great flight safe on time cons online checkin unavailable for certain flights ground organization can be a bit flaky must get there in time last minute terminal change at cdg last minute gate change at keflavik would definitely fly again
22352,volaris,1,i never would have flown with them,they tried to charge us for something that wasnt listed after we had paid the charge was disputed on a credit card so they took us off the manifest and we didnt fly out to start on the way back they didnt do a good job on the pre flight inspection and the plane didnt take off because it didnt have enough speed they canceled the flight on the runway and as we got off we saw that a tire had delaminated and there had been a brake failure the terms and conditions state that if they cancel a flight the passengers are entitled to a hotel transportation to and from and a minimum 25 refund they tried to screw us out of the first flight back and the entire service is over priced for what they offer on top of all the corners they cut if id known this was a frontier subsidiary i never would have flown with them
22972,xiamen airlines,3,staff barely speak english,wuhan to amsterdam via xiamen my flight was cancelled due to bad weather conditions the company sent me an email in chinese stating that i had to rebook my flight but without giving any option of possible different solution once at the airport they were surprised i was asking to be rebooked on another flight andor reimbursed im going to try to follow up on this and see if i can get something but in general i didnt like the way they handle the problem they didnt care about leaving people at the airport without any support in addition both the airport and the cabin staff barely speak english so its very hard to communicate with them

11544,interjet,7,overall better than expected,bogota to mexico city the checkin process is painfully slow but the airport staff was very friendly i have never seen so much care in applying the baggage tags i think there were 5 tags in total per bag the flight was on time and uneventful the plane was quite new 4 years but had no entertainment system apart from some scattered displays they do show the takeoff and landing which is kind of cool for a plane this size the legroom was above average and quite comfortable the service included a small bag of snacks and a drink overall better than expected i would fly again

5804,blue1,3,blue1 customer review,cphhel in economy class i have always been a blue1 fan but after this trip i am not so sure anymore the flights departed and arrived on time which is probably what you can expect from an airline these days i think what really bothered me is that it was so uncomfortable on both flights avro85 although i have flown cphhel on blue 1 quite a few times i cannot remember that i have ever been on a plane with a tighter seat pitch than these two flights it might be that there has been a change in aircraft in addition i think that the flights were expensive given that i got the lowest possible rate about 250 eur for a return ticket all inclusive and the service provided next time it will be finnair
9969,flysafair,4,crew werent helpful at all,cape town to durban had a bit of a struggle breathing while on board decided to move to the back of the plane as the passenger next to me was asleep and leaning towards me which was a bit uncomfortable crew werent helpful at all found me by the cabin but asked me to move back as they had to get on with their work props to the fellow passenger who offered to help
1587,air europa,2,worst customer service,worst customer service ever the staff at embarking point particularly a lady checking the boarding pass was super rude she did not hide her anger against many customers she accused us multiple times of breaking the line while she was allowing people of later groups to skip in front of us then when my husband asked why she threatened him to not allow us to embark it was very unprofessional
22872,wow air,1,i have no complaints,st louis to gatwick via keflavik wow air is a fantastic airline as long as your expectations are accurate from the get go if you want to fly usa europe for 200 but expect in seat entertainment cushy padded chairs and complimentary food and drinks youre dreaming the seats compare to a domestic flight slightly padded and a bit uncomfy after a while but i have no complaints about wow air we flew with a backpack only so cant comment on luggage handling in flight experience was great i brought my kindle and sleptread the entire time got my own food and drink at the airport and had a wonderful trip
7598,corendon airlines,3,corendon airlines customer review,adamantalya and return one negative comment the very narrow seats specially with a 15 year old child on your lap no knee space at all and im just 180 cm my husband had to put his legs behind his neck in order to sit we fly regularly but never in such narrow seats the 4 hour flight time becomes very long because of this extra leg space at the emergency exits costs 15 pp extra but not available when you travel with children checkin was quick both times service is excellent very friendly staff no snacksdrinks included the plane wasnt the youngest but except the dirty toilets it was acceptable if youre not that tall and dont intent to use the toilets or on board services i can recommend this airline
1505,air dolomiti,8,air dolomiti worked ok for us,munich to bologna and pisa to munich both on an embraer 195 economy both flights handled efficiently southbound on time northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight there had been thick fog at muc early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning however support given to those with tight connections modest inflight service snacks and drinks wine came in proper glasses other reviewers seem to have had a hard time but air dolomiti worked ok for us
19511,swoop,1,not impressed and never again,swoop is the worst airline i have ever flown with never again we booked the flight weeks in advance and the flight got cancelled twice the second time was less than 24 hours from checkin time when we did check in for the second time no qr code boarding pass was emailed to us and we couldnt access it through their poorly made website our friends flight also got cancelled and were asked to rebook however after checking in their luggage their flight got canceled 30 mins before take off they rebooked their flights for the next morning when the concert is tonight and i highly doubt that they will ever be reimbursed the flight we are on has empty seats even though my friends were told that the plane was full after talking to the flight attendant asking why they couldnt board apparently it was too late but they had already checked in and made it past security not impressed and never again
20598,tigerair,3,an unscheduled delay,singapore to denpasar with tigerair this was a trial i usually fly garuda or sq i figured it was worth trying tiger as their itinerary fit what i wanted when i showed up to check in i was given a ticket and the agent asked me to go to the service counter i asked why and he informed me that the flight was 3 hours delayed at the service desk they informed me that i had been unreachable when they tried to inform me about 45 minutes previously as if that would have made a difference i asked why there was a delay and was told it was a maintenance issue or a refilling issue in neither case does that explain an unscheduled delay i certainly wont choose to fly them again without some testimony suggesting my experience is highly irregular
18749,southwest airlines,2,attendant was saving good seats,flight attendant was saving good seats for people that she decided she wants many people not just my group tried to sit in the seats but she blocked the seats with her body and gave all kinds of excuses as to why each person shouldnt sit there when she saw people that she liked she unblocked the seats and told them to sit there i dont know how she decides who deserves the good seats but i paid 100 for earlybird check in me and my wife so that we would have choice of the better seats two other people in my group upgraded for the same reason but they couldnt get the seats either and one of those people have hip knee and back issues and upgraded so that he would have a chance at the good seats two knee replacements one hip replacement and multiple back surgeries the whole point of paying extraupgrading is to get those seats i feel jipped and i really hate to say this but there was some kind of favoritism going on furthermore there was another flight attendant that many people said was rude and condescending people throughout the flight were trying to get to the front lavatories the 2 rude flight attendants told several people that the restroom was closed i understand that they were working in that area preparing our drinks and snacks but they were very rude to my wife and several others when telling them to go use the other lavatories i was sitting near the front with my wife and we watched these 2 flight attendants throughout the flight everyone sitting near us was watching and talking about the situation too there was one flight attendant that was very kind and polite though
5372,bangkok airways,9,definitely a boutique airline,bangkok airways is charging very steep prices for a route they have a monopoly on and takes only about an hour and 15 minutes to complete in an older atr 72500 in which you definitely can notice the age airport is quite a distance from mandalay and you are required to enter through security prior to checkin checkin was slow but were welcomed by a friendly agent who invited us to use their lounge bangkok airways is definitely a boutique airline that offers complimentary drinkssnacks at certain airports for their economy passengers too lounge was ok with a limited snack offer hot food and alcohol you would be charged for boarding was slightly late and went by stairs to ground welcomed by two lovely cabin crew and took only 15 minutes to get airborne complimentary meal provided with drinks cold unfortunately as there is no galley in an atr landing was hard but on time and we were quickly through customs

16466,qantaslink,6,cabin crew were friendly,there was a delay in departure due to late arrival of the aircraft to the airport as a results of bad weather as a results some of us missed our connecting flights to jakarta and kuala lumpur upon arrival in singapore a buggy was waiting for us and we were immediately taken to our new gates we were told that the next flight will be in less than one hour hence they could not guarantee our luggage would arrive with us upon arrival to our final destination our luggage did not arrive as expected we waited for the arrival of another aircraft from singapore still our luggage was not delivered we lodged a report and our luggage arrived to our home address at 6 pm the next day why push us to the next immediate flight when our luggage couldnt join us i wonder otherwise the aircraft is comfortable food was delivered at speed and efficacy cabin crew were friendly
3926,alitalia,1,the trip was a fail,washington to rome the trip was a fail because my passport expires within the three months needed to enter rome mistake on me but my issue is after you have processed my passport and then printed my boarding pass they still allowed me to pay for bags when it should have been flagged that i wouldnt be able to fly im at the gate and the attendant looks at my passport and says you arent valid ok so will my baggage fee be refunded no this is definitely unfair contacting the customer support team was a good lesson learned that all support staff are not created equally these guys should have given my money back at the least but such is life hopefully they get better and its true you get what you pay for sometimes

22286,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,this little airline is brilliant antwerp to london city antwerp is probably the best little airport in the world free parking 10 minute check in simple walk to the plane no fuzz london city airport is the best airport in london so slightly above mediocre vlm f50 clean and fitted with great new interior staff very friendly and despite short flight two drinks and a sandwich with a smile wish this service was available on more routes in europe
19261,sun country airlines,1,what a joke of an airline,i would give this airline a 0 if i could we are very displeased with the service that we have had this past week with this airline this was supposed to be a special trip for our honeymoon as we have recently been married it started out great in denver colorado and we get everything checked in at the airport and paid money for the checked bags our first flight was delayed due to they couldnt find the plane is what we got told over the intercom the flight was delayed about 40 minutes for that and delayed another 20 minutes for the passenger who threw up before take off we then missed our connection flight which was serviced by the same airline sun country they knew we were coming and didnt wait 10 minutes for the 3 2 in my party and one other man going to myrtle beach of us they got us on the soonest flight with southwest and reassured us multiple times that our bags would be sent to our final destination we asked 3 people to make sure and even checked baggage claim and we were told that it would be ok we arrive in myrtle beach to no bags and no contact from anyone from this airline we have been working with a southwest agent to get the information we have spent the last 4 days in myrtle beach with absolutely no luggage thanks to you guys it took me hours to try and get a hold of you guys and when i finally did you guys werent happy or trying at all to get us our bags our honeymoon was absolutely ruined and now they only want to reimburse half of the money we spent on essential needs what a joke of an airline
19305,sunwing airlines,2,needed to cancel my booking and then rebook,i made a mistake on the name of one of the tickets on the day booking upon noticing the error i used the edit option on the website to correct the name fast forward to the day before my flight turns out that the name change was not administered in order to proceed with the trip i had to call and have the name changed over the phone given the short notice they needed to cancel my booking and then rebook this cost me an additional 500 cad per passenger each traveler was booked to each have their own room at the resort upon arriving at the resort they put me and my travelling companion in the same apartment that offered two rooms this was not clear and not at all what we were expecting we wanted an apartment each and there no drop down option for booking an apartment when scheduling a trip we asked for individual apartments at the venue and we were told nothing could be done currently im discussing these matters with sunwing service via email unfortunately its been 3 days since there initial message no follow up
11593,intersky,4,intersky customer review,friedrichshafen hamburg it was one of my best experiences on a regional flightairline aircraft was clean the crew checkin to cabin crew was very polite as well as highly professional flight attendant made clearly understandable announcementssafety demos the only downside is that intersky asks passengers to pay prohibitive expensive prices for onboard drinkssnacks but since they consider themselves as a low cost airline truly providing lcc price level it was no surprise and everybody is free not to buy anything
13761,liat,6,liat customer review,the journey did not get off to a good start port of spain airport is not the most organised airport in the world long queues staff who appear to hate their jobs no air conditioning and generally bad attitudes this was not helped by an liat check in manager making us join 4 incorrect queues before we could check in making the process take over 90 minutes that and a long queue for security meant we were not happy travellers especially having been told our bags might get there or then again they might not once through security it was a different picture friendly polite gate staff kept us well informed about delays and boarding was measured and orderly on board there was one polite cabin attendant and one who literally announced that she didnt want to be there the 40 minute flight was enough time for us to complete landing cards and enjoy a complimentary coke the captain kept us informed on the journey making up time and pointing out places of interest during the flight the flight made up for a pretty horrible check in and we were delighted to be reunited with our bags without any issue
18467,skytrans airlines,8,recommend this airline,brisbane to toowoomba and i was amazed at the service provided by this small regional airline skytrans airlines even though the flight in a small propjet was only 30 minutes duration we were given bottles of water and packets of potato crisps returning the next day service was equally as good would recommend this airline
3836,alaska airlines,7,flight attendants are pretty good,as a firsttime flyer this definitely was a nice introduction to fast travel by airplane pros then cons pros 1 flight boarding time is usually delayed cause airport security or passenger offloading so if youve arrived with barely an hour to get to the terminal after going through tsa and boarding pass first you should reasonably make it 2 flight attendants are pretty good about making you comfortable 3 tolerable wait times for taxiing and whatnot cons 1 the twinengine plane boeing 737 i believe economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia additionally the foldout for laptops is only big enough for the pc you want to use a mouse well need to use another foldout on your right 2 if want additional elbow room firstclass ticket is necessary 3 lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped im skinny and anyone whos taken care of hisher body should be able to use them without difficulty
21949,vistara,8,overall a fantastic experience,overall a fantastic experience with vistara though the flight was delayed by half hour the checkin was smooth and quick the inair experience was fantastic there was a wide selection of meals and desserts on offer the vistara a321 is perhaps the only flight in which you can experience lie flat seats and a nice big ife screen in domestic flights within india the service was prompt and pleasant just a few things which could add to the experience a wider selection of content would be needed for international routes the content on offer was great for a domestic hop but thin in case the same selection is offered for an international flight the encalm lounge in delhi is a improvement over the previous lounge but still not comparable to the one in mumbai i ended up leaving immediately and preferred to use the amex lounge over this
13110,kulula,2,kulula customer review,we flew to ot on kulula last week from cape town the initial flight i booked was cancelled by cell phone and we were placed on the next flight with no apology and great inconvenience to ourselves on our return flight we were bumped at the last moment having arrived 2 hours earlythen told they could actually fit us in the flight by then was running at least 34 an hour late the couple ahead of us had been bumped twice that day
22994,xiamen airlines,5,xiamen airlines customer review,dalian to kuala lumpur via xiamen i might have rated it more positively if this first time of mine to travel with them was a domestic flight it felt like a domestic flight to me in all dimensions you are not allowed to check in online or select seat before trip no matter how much you pay for the ticket whats worse the first segment domestic of the flight opens its checkin 15 hrs before it opens for intl passengers they can check in even earlier online so the 5 of us we were almost given seats far apart when passing immigration at dalian you felt it was quite informal and then you pass a formal immigration at xiamen again equipment was b738 what you may not expect to sit in for seven plus hours seat pitch was no different than any domestic no ptv poor tv programme dinner was ok coming with bread pickled snack and fruit cabin crew not as good as they boasted themselves to be and did nothing to stop a dalian tour group from talking the whole route and running up and down the cabin to annoy other passengers this particular flight i took mf831 was not punctual as usual i wouldnt recommend anyone to try xiamen intl flight
16304,porter airlines,3,over 44 for my baggage fee,toronto to montreal they have completely changed over the last five years i will never use them again they rip you off on your baggage fee if you dont book it online however they dont tell you that when you arrive at the airport you cannot book your baggage charge on a separate booking station you have to wait for over one hour to speak to an airline associate i had to wait over one hour in the line up because their was only one person serving hundreds of people flying out yesterday then when i got to the line up she charged me over 44 for my baggage fee on the way down i flew with westjet who charged me 30 on top of everything else i had to ask this associate four times to give me a receipt and to return my photo id they use to be the best airline use air canada or west jet in the future
22037,vistara,9,amazing service and new aircraft,one of the best fullservice airlines in india with amazing service and new aircraft which are well maintained in terms of cleanliness and hygiene vistara economy has good legroom the food offered was complementary and was good amazing inflight entertainment to be viewed on your phone
16168,play,9,streamlined and nofrills airline,play is a great value and i would fly with them again if the price was still quite a bit lower than other options it is streamlined and nofrills airline dont expect wifi in seat outlets or free drinks do expect a safe and efficient experience all four of my flights departed on time and arrived early there was ample overhead storage comfortable seats and friendly crew kef is a pleasure to connect through i had an extremely fast customs experience and there is a delightful minimarket style food option there seemed to be a hitch with boarding in bos with getting the jetway connected but the crew got everyone boarded in minutes one thing that i wish i had known was that it is difficult to look out the emergency exit row window so dont expect to enjoy the view
3682,airlink,3,wouldnt fly this airline again,there was a single person manning the counters at checkin my bags were overweight so was directed to another counter to pay for the excess which is no issue but that took 20 mins as they kept allowing other customers in front of the line in flight food was a joke now have been waiting at the baggage conveyor for over 30 mins and no bags have come out i expect this is due to the fact we arrived earlier than scheduled and were redirected to a parking bay other than the one designated for us and therefore assume this has caused some confusion and delay with the luggage being off loaded and reclaimed i wouldnt fly this airline again to be honest
20241,thai smile airways,7,the taste of the snack was too bad,almost all things are good except the snack or light meals in flight the taste of the snack was too bad other services in flight were good ground staff and flight attendants are kind with a warm welcome to all customer
20381,thomas cook airlines,9,nice smooth flight,newcastle to corfu flight left around 1015 mins late due to air traffic control restriction quick ascent seatbelt signs turned off very quickly seat were ok a little cramped if you are tall but the seat itself was comfortable like the fact they have made the backs rigid plastic so if people go into the pockets on the back the person in front shouldnt really feel it there was overhead screens which initially showed the route map and later turned into a childrens film one drink and snack round before meal was served about 1hr 30mins into flight could have been a little quicker as the flight set off at 530am and everyone was ready for breakfast nice smooth flight a few announcements from captain when we flew over the stunning alps flight was uneventful meal was good i enjoyed the breakfast and it was served with tea coffee or juice flight home was great as well food was good although if i was being picky the portions were small but you do get crackers cheese a bread roll and a small pudding to make up for the hot meal being small drinks and snacks are expensive just like any other airline usual sales pitch on duty free goods not many takers on our flight toilets were clean and functioning i find thomas cook fine for these short journeys we have gone with them long haul on the larger planes to vegas and we found them fine for the price we would fly with them again
12590,jetstar pacific,2,already been delayed twice,ho chi minh to danang we have already been delayed twice now leaving 9 hours later than expected we are bracing ourselves for 12 more delays it is likely they keeping delaying people to a flight that will be full enough in order to save them money thanks for a complete absence of customer service jetstar i will do my best to deter anyone else from using your sorry excuse of an airline
5679,blue air,4,cannot expect any help,glasgow to bucharest return blue air for the greediness of 8 placed all three of us in three corners of the plane on both routes flown lots of budget airlines but they have crossed even ryanair on this one staff at glasgow airport was great who managed to help us sit together while with airlineairport staff from romania you cannot expect any help from them at all this was the case for every other family with small children although they are cheap i would avoid them at all cost if you are travelling on a family holiday
22022,vistara,9,onboard experience is top notch,the checkin process was a downer the staff didnt seem enthusiastic for a business class desk this is doubly strange vistara is currently the finest full service airline in india and the onboard experience is top notch the seating is comfortable for shorthaul the service warm and the snacks served outstanding when is vistara going to start offering inflight wifi
18831,southwest airlines,3,no transparency no competence,weather delays and even cancellations as happened on 12262022 are to be expected however my daughter and her family were on two cancelled flights today they were told that they couldnt give them their luggage and that it could be days and that they wouldnt call them they just wanted their bags so that could drive to their destination ive never heard of a cancelled flight where they cant give passengers their bags off of the cancelled flight in the middle of the day and they couldnt begin to know how many days it would take to get their bags back not because they were lost because they wouldnt take the bags of the plane no transparency no competence no compassion and no urgency to serve customers they should be ashamed
354,aeroflot russian airlines,6,on time with good food and comfort,new york to nursultan return via moscow review covers svojfk su10024sep as this was the best of the four flights ground staff in all cities are surprisingly professional flights board well in advance of departure and airplanes when loaded depart schedules are not padded for time and flight time is accurate premium economy is excellent value with comfortable seats decent amenities and big filling meals the only alcohol served is beer and wine drinks service is followed immediately with meal oddly the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep announcements are continuous and interrupting first prerecorded russianenglish followed by crew russianenglish announcements repeating the same message crews are typical ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant willing smiling junior cabin staff services svotsesvo on airbus equipment with no ife are similar with nice food disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort svo is sprawling transiting without visa is easy but you cannot linger between flights due to crowds and distance aeroflot was ok on time with good food and comfort the nonstop announcements and timing of meal services however are offputting and would cause me to look at other airline options
9821,flydubai,3,seats are so uncomfortable,flydubai is one of the worst airlines i have ever traveled with their prices are extremely high the seats are so uncomfortable in addition the flight took an hour more than the usual the hostess was so unfriendly and mean the exit seats were all empty and we were not allowed to sit there as we had to pay extra money
3289,airasia india,6,crew were very proactive and good,airasia india from bengaluru to delhi the original time of departure was 0005 hours however there was a delay of 15 minutes which was communicated in advance the boarding pass print and check in of the baggage was performed at the designated points boarding was slightly delayed and as a result of which we ended up being delayed by over 20 minutes the seats inside the airbus were comfortable enough although it could be uncomfortable for longer flights seat pitch was comfortable at 30 inches and for someone who is 510 it was okay the crew were very proactive and good i observed that the crew even provided infant seat belts and snack items we landed at delhi around 2025 minutes behind schedule and the baggage collecting took some time on the coveyor belt overall id say that if you get this flight for a good price and for a reasonable distance it is okay
11443,insel air,7,staff was helpful and good,it is true that the flight started the boarding 20 min late the airplane is not the newest and it is hard to hear the staffs alerts because the sound equipament makes a lot of noise but the amount that i paid for the ticket was good the staff was helpful and good the service during the flight was excellent with complimentary food candy and beverages if you are taking the flight from miami to centralsouth america i suggest you to fly during the day my flight was in the afternoon and i had the pleasure to see miami coast as well a lot of the carribean islands it is not all the flights that you take in life that will give this opportunity to you the companys magazine is worth to take home they have an onboard raffle and stop the raffle when someone win
11678,israir airlines,5,israir airlines customer review,premium class from new york to tel aviv its a budget form of business class but service was excellent seating quite comfortable compared to coach seats and pricing very reasonable they give you free passes to the business class lounges at jfk and ben gurion airports although the ben gurion airports dan lounge was crowded and not very comfortable the jfk lounge in terminal 4 was a very pleasant place to wait this fare was well worth the money less than half of other airlines business class
13354,lan airlines,7,lan airlines customer review,fragru and grulhr flight departed on time nowadays there is not much differences between the main airlines and lan offered what is expected in economy class two full meals somewhat more basic than on main european carriers but portions a little larger good ife system and professional service from the staff less personal but on european carriers but nothing to complain about main complain was the hard narrow seats on boeing 777300er as in other carriers using the 3x4x4 option seats are much less comfortable than formerly and make longdistant flights something of a challenge but tam is not alone here
13618,laudamotion,4,cabin was very dirty,vienna to dublin flying with laudamotion means low comfort you cannot expect a lot at least i would be happy if the staff would be friendly the cabin clean and the overall onboardexperience would be good the staff was very unmotivated and not really friendly the cabin was very dirty sticky seats and broken tables food and drinks had to be purchased which is okay but the service was very inefficient and slow boarding was slow and chaotic long waiting times at the gate in the stairhouse outside the building and again in front of the stairs of the aircraft
16446,qantaslink,8,cabin crew were efficient and friendly,qantaslink branded flight operated by alliance airways the plane an embraer e190 had alliance markings but the cabin crew wore qantas uniforms first time on an e190 but id noticed on the qantas website specs the seat pitch was more generous than their b737 between that and the design of the seat it was a very comfortable cabin indeed good space relatively quiet smooth flight particularly the landing the only downside was being a leased plane and not a qantas own aircraft there was no qantas entertainment or inflight wifi this scuttled my plan to do some sightseeing planning while in the air to adelaide but i was content to play some stored tunes and relax in the comfy seat cabin crew were efficient and friendly
6576,cathay pacific airways,7,ive asked for a partial refund,i actually made four longhaul flights on cathay this trip overall the standard was solid fourstar rather than five the food and drink were acceptable if unexciting and the seats were comfortable but the absence of any sort of privacy screens was surprising and felt dated all the flight attendants were extraordinarily prompt at responding to requests for service and appeared willing i had two main issues on the flight from auckland to hong kong 1112 hours 38 seats in business i think there was no champagne available after takeoff a flight attendant told me they had only loaded three bottles which ran out on the ground the flight was late into hong kong so i was transferred to a later flight on which i was assigned without warning or apology a middle seat instead of the window id reserved the absence of any privacy screen meant i spent a rather intimate 13 hours with a stranger he was a nice chap but if i want a blind date ill go online rather than on an aircraft i paid 5000 for business because i wanted champane and privacy so i am not too happy anyways ive asked for a partial refund and was going to await a response from cathay before posting but cathay has just responded a member of our customer care team will review your case and respond in approximately six weeks time oh well
70,adria airways,6,adria airways customer review,this was my first time with adria short hop from kbp to lju the airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag online sale worked fine online checkin system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time nearly 2 hours early luckily their call center worked well and i was told to report to the airport at normal time and use wrong boarding pass it really worked there were about 14 passengers onboard canadair200 the plane was new and clean seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay my seat didnt work well so i did take off and landed in reclined position food was much below average small cheese sandwich bar service was good and generous flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime crew were cheerful and attentive my special meal was delivered and was okay much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers all in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket also saw no difference between business and economy cabin same seats for different price
2538,air new zealand,1,very stressful situation,air new zealand delayed their flight by 10 hours because staff resting requirements they sent us an update 12 hours before the flight we were in singapore so checked out and went to an airport to talk to someone as we would miss all connecting flights and picking up our fur baby on time where she couldnt stay another night there was no onefrom air nz at singapore airport the info center said use their help line the wait time was 4 hours by the time we rang them we had 15 hours left before the flight we could have re booked by the time they picked up it was 4 hours later very stressful situation we were stuck in an international airport with no one to talk to except stay on gold 4 hours hoping someone would pick up you should be ashamed
14481,malaysia airlines,5,the crew was super nice,this is my usual route very short flight within 30 minutes everything seems normal but in modest starting from boarding the plane until disembarking the crew was super nice throughout the flight light snack salted peanut and orange juice are more than enough for this short flight seat was modest but if possible can be upgraded
12874,klm royal dutch airlines,3,check process was a shambles,the check process was a shambles the bag drop system was broken down and the check in desks were moving incredibly slowly worst still when we were finally loaded on the plane they advised us we would going nowhere for an hour as there were delays in amsterdam why load the plane at all
7894,cubana airlines,5,cubana airlines customer review,havana to cancun economy class arrived at the airport to find the flight had been delayed by 15 hours it took almost 2 hours to check in clear immigration and go through security airport is a bit chaotic there was another hour delay which was not explained to us at all once on board the flight experience was actually not too bad flight attendants were professional and served us complimentary snacks and drinks the aircraft was a new tupolev 204100e
20528,tianjin airlines,9,tianjin airlines customer review,never heard of this airline until i flew in july on embraer 190 from tianjin to ningbo but impressed by service standards at the airport the check in and boarding was quick and efficient and fas were very attentive okay their english language skills need improving but never seen such an efficient and smiling set of fas seats comfortable for this quite short trip meals was also good lack of newspapers though will fly them again in september and woulkd have no doubts about recommending them to others as a musttry airline
2060,air koryo,6,air koryo customer review,pekfnj on tu204 check in quick and efficient at pek clean new aircraft seating reasonably comfortable and adequate for 2 hour trip was served bland meal but no worse than many other economy class meals service was efficient but cold drinks offered and free english language dprk literature entertaining pretake off video with politics included and inflight video showed happy images of the dprk quite reasonable flight noticeable that all nonkoreans were in the front economy cabin with the back cabin full of koreans pre take off and touchdown were marked by the happy playful music of an electronic band eerie but very much part of the dprk experience i was pleased to land given the safety reputation
6104,british airways,3,i wouldnt recommend british airways,i wouldnt recommend british airways at all i tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and i waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for 2 weeks website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you dont receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldnt recommend it is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around
2906,air tahiti nui,5,business class is old,air tahiti nui is basically the only airline that flies to french polinesia the business class is old and the seat do not recline to 180 its a very long flight from any airport i flew from japan and it was a 12 hours flight the aircraft is very loud there is no privacy in the business seat the food is really good and the staff are really polite the entertainment is quite poor
5744,blue islands,5,blue islands customer review,gcisou very good value everything included in the headline price no extras nice little lounge at guernsey for free drinks and biscuits dornier 328 very comfortable aircraft
11915,jazeera airways,4,worst international flight,dubai to ahmadabad via kuwait the worst international flight i ever had the cabin crew didnt even welcomed us well on board my flight got delayed for 3 hours i already did web check in the morning and they call me in noon saying that my flight is canceled they were fooling me anyhow i asked to manager and got a flight 2 hours prior which led me to long layover in kuwait when i entered the flight the attendants didnt welcome us warmly as they were busy in their own work after on boarding they dont even ask for a packed water bottle for the whole flight i was hungry and even tough it was an international flight i didnt got a meal though tickets says they will offer me the floor was messy of flight and the seats were not comfortable really dint prefer or recommend anyone to fly with jazeera worst flight
20611,tigerair,7,smooth flight and seat reasonably comfortable,flight was delayed by 2 hours they would have known this at the time of checkin but said nothing until departure time came and went and still no incoming aircraft and even then only when a couple of us demanded an update on board experience was fine smooth flight and seat reasonably comfortable a special mention for the food i preordered a vegetarian tomato koora this was small and predominantly rice but has to be one of the tastiest meals i can remember airline or otherwise i would fly tigerair again but i would make sure as i did this time that i allowed a long gap between connecting flights
3838,alaska airlines,4,been on hold for 6 hours,been on hold for 6 hours booking 7 1200 tickets and the website continues to have issue after issue its like you have the audacity to want to travel these days alaska airlines used to be amazing and generally once on board the flight attendants are good and all is well but the entire process from buying tickets to check in is ungodly now a days god forbid luggage gets lost they also act like its your fault if i didnt live here i wouldnt be flying with them but the free bags as residents keeps me going
22481,volotea,9,be more friendly with the passengers,some ladies of the staff from the land of the airport of oviedo had to be more friendly with the passengers i had to suffer the bad ones walking along the landing strip doesnt seem good to me sometimes its cold and it llueve the same thing happens when the plane is the last day of the day until now i am very satisfied with the timetable and timetables of volotea on the other hand to the megavolotea plus partners i believe that they would allow us to withdraw the departure boarding cards and immediate departure and not have to wait 4 days before departure you have to pay a supplement for choosing seats and then they allow us to withdraw the cards in the whole it is refunded algunas seoritas del personal de tierra del aeropuerto de oviedo deberan de ser ms amables con los pasajeros he tenido que sufrir los malosmodos de alguna de ellas por otra parte embarcar a las 630 am andando por la pista de aterrizaje no me parece bien a veces hace fro y llueve lo mismo si el avin es el ltimo del danos dejan en la pista hasta ahora estoy muy satisfecho con la puntualidad y horarios de volotea por otra parte a los socios megavolotea plus creo que nos deberan de permitir sacar las tarjetas de embarque de ida y vuelta de inmediato y no tener que esperar 4 das antes de la salida del vuelo o tener que pagar un suplemento por elegir asientos y as nos permiten sacar las tarjetasno todo es recaudar
1278,air canada rouge,3,missing my connection to tampa with united,my initial jazz flight july 23 left 2hours late from vancouver which lead to missing my connection to tampa with united after 2 hours in the united airlines customer service line up i was informed that there was nothing that united could do because air canada was in control of the ticket and they were the only ones that could rebook me on the next flight this has to be the worst policy because there was not an air canada agent anywhere in the denver airport to be found i had no idea how to get this problem solved after and exhausting search i was so distraught that i left the secured area and after more attempts to find an air canada agent i went to the united airlines check in counter the united agent carol ann went above and beyond to help me and while she was on hold with air canada she was busy checking in customers for a departing flight she finally was successful in being able to provide me with a boarding pass onto a flight leaving to tampa the following morning how is it possible that united airlines can be an alliance partner when they do not have authority to get air canada passengers where they are booked to go when the passenger has an existing boarding pass if passengers who find themselves in this situation are supposed to know to call air canada then that is also a poor policy i do not roam with my phone and certainly not going to pay for cell minutes to hold for who knows how long
16656,regent airways,4,mannerless attitude,unprofessional mannerless attitude we flew from dhaka to coxs bazar at new years eve due to govt election flight was delayed 15 hours but they didnt mention that before after sitting on the aircraft we came to know about that we were stuck into the flight for all that time the ground staffs behaviour was nice and professional but the cabin crew acted like they are also some guest passengers there even after asking for newspaper they didnt even bother to manage one
18899,spicejet,8,i want to praise the services,i want to praise the services offered by spicejet and praise the cabin crew staff on the flight the entire staff team was so helpful and nature was so humble the attentiveness and politeness were thoroughly professional i highly appreciate your staff and their professional behavior
6170,brussels airlines,7,it was a good flight,it was a good flight and the cabin crew was friendly and will try to help you if you have a question it was an a320 without entertainment i remember having more leg space in the a320s from vueling lowcost than i had with brussels airlines
7301,comair,7,overall a decent flight,johannesburg to cape town the slow lounge at jnb sets the standard with an impressive array of food even at 11 am and ample seating the bar service is good too and some neighbours had already finished their third refill of pink champagne by the time they boarded the same flight as is common on other ba flights group 1 passengers were kept waiting on the airbridge before boarding actually commenced service on board was friendly and efficient but very much old school ba as far as the fourcourse lunch was concerned at least one was able to see the main course before choosing it departure and arrival were pretty much on schedule and baggage collection was speedy too overall a decent flight
17714,scoot,3,they just let everyone board,being a frequent flyer and spending extra in purchasing for priority boarding i see scoot is not ensuring what is being promised to be delivered once the boarding is announced they just let everyone board without checking priority give zone 1 for boarding first but no different
22647,wideroe,4,wideroe customer review,bodoebergen with dash very good staff friendly and polite crossed the south norwegian mountains landscape and take off perfect just quite noisy with this kind of aircraft
20852,transavia,2,one of the worst airlines,one of the worst airlines ive travelled with when it comes to service and onboard safety and comfort i always have difficulty breathing while on their flight i never have this problem with other airline this time since im 5 months pregnant i asked for oxygen and they refused to give it to me repeatedly me and my husband asked them for oxygen over 5 times and they told us that unless im passing out or visually suffering they will not give me oxygen then they proceeded in giving cold towels claiming im just over heating
12168,jetairfly,5,they always have a delay,miami to brussels i have nothing negative to say about the crew they are friendly and courteous nor about the food i find it rather tasty and well chosen however it irritates me extremely that they always have a delay and you only find out in the airport while checking in it is so hard to send your customers a simple text to inform there is no use to come early to the airport as the flight is delayed with 2 hours on top we get offered a voucher for lunch for a value of 4 dollars 10 cents really not impressed
12456,jetstar asia,7,journey was a pleasant one,ho chi minh city to singapore jetstar asia is one of the better lowcost carrier in the region checkin staff were quick and were able to deal with the high volume of customers in ho chi minh city within 10 minutes we were on our way however at the airport we were met with 3 gate changes within the span of an hour the information provided by the airline on the airport displays were also inaccurate and had confused numerous passengers on this flight one effort however that ought to be noted was how the checkin staff had sauntered through the airport spaces to inform passengers of the gate changes boarding as a result was late the crew on the flight however were professional the entire journey on board the aircraft towards singapore was a pleasant one taking into account the fact that jetstar asia is a lowcost budget carrier the level of service provided is acceptable and should be lauded however jetstar can do much more in ensuring that their ground crew are sufficiently trained to deal with the unexpected situations which may arise on the grounds to attempt to alleviate the customers frustration
12713,karthago airlines,6,karthago airlines customer review,gatwick to monastir return we took off on time both ways the aircraft are dated but seat was comfortable food going was fine but only a stale sandwich coming back crew pleasant the toilets are a lot to be desired and we made sure that we used the airport facilities before boarding on the return flight
6661,cathay pacific airways,8,incabin service is nice,the hong kong tapei is cathays busiest route and no surprise that the incabin service is nice however the ground crew at gate and transfer desk are not that passionate and proactive on helping passengers perhaps its a morning flight the aircraft is a brand new a350
21065,tuifly,4,tuifly customer review,mancgnman with tuifly this past week could teach easyjet and ryanair a thing or two good value 130 euros return speedy friendly checkin seat preselection at no additional cost 20kg of checked bags at no additional cost spotless 737 with reasonably priced onboard catering decent seats with fair legroom flight crew efficient and smiling a breath of freshair after some of the snarling horrors i have encountered on other lccs at the moment they only serve man and ncl in the uk from a handful of german airports colognebonn stuttgart and hannover but there are some really interesting onward destinations such as tenerife for which i just forked out 400 for an easyjet flightfromhell
8592,el al israel airlines,9,wanted to write this to thank you,on a recent flight from newark to tel aviv my wife had a rather unpleasant experience and i wanted to write this to thank you for the way that you handled it my son who is just about 3 years old suffers from cerebral palsy and is handicapped his handicap is understandably difficult for him as his parents it is difficult for us as well one of the most difficult times for us and for him is when we need to fly my son is in a regimented routine within his therapeutic school services and taking him out of the routine into an area which he feels constricted a plane is very very challenging but we do it often to bring him to the us for special treatments on thursday 1612020 my wife and son were returning from one of these trips abroad following an intense week of therapies evaluations etc this trip was different than others in that it was the shortest trip we have done and it was the first time my wife and son were flying alone without my daughter and i at some point in the flight my son got very uncomfortable and began crying loudly my wife began the usual routine of holding him walking with him etc trying to sooth and calm his nerves but nothing was working as this was happening out of nowhere our son began to throw up uncontrollably my wife was shocked and started crying herself at this exact moment a frustrated passenger got up and began verbally abusing her yelling in front of the entire plane that she needs to get our child in check my wife responded explaining our sons challenges and disabilities at which time others around her joined in causing the abusive passenger to take his seat and quiet down and here is where your team stepped up almost immediately my wife and son were surrounded by flight attendants helping to clean the area diffuse the situation and even assisted my wife in cleaning up our son the attendants continued coming with warm towels blankets and other items that they may have needed one of the flight attendants even came and sat with my wife and son for about 15 minutes talking and being supportive to them she even offered to play with our son so that my wife could go clean herself up words cannot begin to express the thanks and gratitude that i have to your staff for this
10380,germanwings,7,staff friendly food terrible,easy checkin at dsseldorf the germanwings flight was on time seats good for a lowcost airline the food was terrible and expensive the normal ticket price excludes luggage and for including luggage checkin you have to pay extra money staff were friendly

8915,ethiopian airlines,9,all money refunded to my credit card correctly,we had 3 return flights booked and paid for in april due to covid travel restrictions asked for a refund via email no response so then a phone call to australian office told to phone head office in africa emailed again and received reply with lots of exclamation marks saying 46 month processing time didnt quite believe it was a genuine email but 5 days later all money refunded to my credit card correctly happily surprised sad not to have been flying looking forward to a future african holiday
6455,caribbean airlines,7,service was polite and understated,before boarding the plane we arrived at port of spain airport early from our transfers and we were delighted to be allowed to check in early breeze through security and spend a few hours in the delightful caribbean airlines lounge nice and relaxed in there and pretty good selection of food available strangely though while spirits were readily available wine and beer were on request which i found a little odd boarding was a free for all with passengers ignoring the boarding staff completely much to the annoyance of the gate staff upon boarding the plane was amazed to be on a wide bodied 767 which i didnt know flew this route we were in 2j and 2k and having experienced a slightly cramped 737 flight on the outward leg were delighted with the idea of flat beds and tons of leg room the flight departed on time and the jovial captain detailed our route about 20 minutes into service drinks and nuts were served including a perfectly chilled mot and chandon before dinner service we had preselected our meals and our thoughts that carribean serve some of the best inflight meals we have ever tasted were confirmed with a superbly spicy thai green chicken curry for me and a equally nice thai green tofu curry for my partner which were served after salads and bread salmon and a beef pepperpot were also available impressive meals that were this months signature dishes sadly my seat didnt work much so had little chance to enjoy the flat bed however my partners worked fine inflight entertainment was equally limited to 5 channels which did work in some seats and didnt work in others which was disappointing however the legroom and comfort was far superior obviously to the outward journey service was polite and understated which i liked from a pleasant crew and we landed on time in jfk pleasantly surprised with our carribean airlines experience and will definitely use them again on these routes

11396,icelandair,7,the seating wasnt bad for coach,i had the foresight to fly back home cheaply before borders were shut in some countries boeing 757s are hardly spacious but the seating wasnt bad for coach in a narrow bodythe cabin was immaculate it had that new plane smell crew polite and efficient if a little reserved compared to other nationalities i dont expect to be pampered on a low cost airline buy on board menu was ok fairly priced for a european airline
12409,jetstar asia,1,unfairness of this company,blown away with the absolute rudeness and unfairness of this company and its customer service i brought a guitar as a carry on from bali to singapore with no issues on a jetstar flight on my flight from singapore to kuala lumpur they refused to allow me to take my guitar as a carry on and required me to check it they told me it was the previous attendants mistake on the flight from bali i asked for a free bag check and wrap to make sure the guitar would be safe and they declined and insisted i pay for their mistake the guitar was not padded and was not ready for checking i ended up leaving the guitar in the airport since cost of wrapping the guitar and checking it was almost as much as the guitar and the wrapping likely would not have kept the guitar safe the staff was incredibly rude and talked back to me when i was just trying to find a solution to my problem never flying with them again check bags are incredibly overpriced as well and the weight limit for carry on and checked bags is ludicrously low seats are tight and uncomfortable we almost missed our flight from oahu to sydney because the staff didnt communicate that our bags were going through to bali even though we told the first attendant that they were and she told us all was set

13958,loganair,9,these flights are superb,travelled out on the tuesday morning flight from glasgow at 7am slight 20 mins delay but the flight now only takes about 35 mins in these newer jet engined planes instead ot the turbo props which used to be used on this route offered a drink and a snack with it which was nice and touched down enjoying some lovely scenery on the isle of lewis just after 8am back again on the 435 flight from stornoway to glasgow on the wednesday delayed 25mins due to the island air traffic control but again great flight and a snack and cup of tea some photos out over the scottish islands below then straight back into glasgow good flights slightly expensive but the ferry takes the best part of a day if you travel up from glasgow so these flights are superb and now there are 4 daily return flights

14009,lot polish airlines,9,id definitely go with them again,the flight attendants were all nice and even though i hadnt ordered vegetarian food in advance its what i ended up getting anyway the food was good and after the long flight from los angeles to warsaw i took a much smaller plane from warsaw to paris even though this flight was only a couple of hours they gave us snacks and drinks and again they were super nice and the service was great my only complaints are that the seats were a bit hard so bringing a cushion or using an extra blanket would help and on the long flight i couldnt charge my phone with the outlet on the seat but these things were minor and id definitely go with them again
13613,laudamotion,3,absolutely no legroom,vienna to dublin return to put the positive points in the first place the planes on both flights were very clean and on board staff very friendly and professional on the outbound flight just a couple of weeks after booking we were informed it would depart 6 hrs later than initially foreseen without any reason being given for that however we decided to stay booked on that flight as we had hotels etc already booked on the day of the flight itself in the end the flight was delayed another 145 hrs again with no reason given at the gate which was btw very cramped had no airconditioning and no seating available at the return flight checkin was with ryanair and very chaotic with no staff available to assist absolutely no legroom on both flights

5425,batik air,3,reputation for nonreliability,batik air has a reputation for nonreliability as far as punctuality is concern worst experience this time though flying in from singapore to kl on 16th jul 2023 was also delayed because of my arrival into kl on the 19th jul 2023 heading back also turned out to be a disappointment as the flight od 807 was delayed by 1 hr 45 min
17837,shandong airlines,6,happy with the service,i traveled from guangzhou to jinan and i was happy with the service the airline even replaced my suitcase that broke during the flight calling shandong airlines and deal with their customer service was not a pleasing experience the customer service lady was unprofessional when i asked questions she would not reply to me and she eventually hang up bad customer service personnel she did speak english but constantly ignores my questions
20344,thomas cook airlines,9,good value for money,having used ba virgin and saa before i was pleasantly surprised with thomas cook check in was smooth and flight only 10 mins late leaving flight itself was smooth and and seat was reasonable for 12 hour flight crew were polite and the james martin meal was good landed on time i paid for priority bording but aside for security at gatwick it was a waste of money the meal on return from cape town was locally sourced and poor inflight entertainment is basic and cost 5 to upgrade so i would suggest a book or kindle although the screens on the a330 are very good and have a usb port tc charge for cheap earphones and best to take your own snacks and drinks are extra so suggest you get some before boarding overall good value for money at nearly 900 cheaper than ba for 2 and the a330 is a far better plane than the ba747 tc flight slot was akward arriving at cape town 2305 and departing there at 0030 but that was only on the dates i selected

8780,estonian air,7,estonian air customer review,vilniustallinn ov 356 sept 2014 we were very surprised when the checkin lady at vilnius airport charged us the equivalent of around 10 euro pp for the checkin the use of the existing checkin machines at vilnius airport would cause this fee as well she explained to us the only way to get a free checkin would have been the use of a smartphone we did not unfortunately have this possibility up to now i have never encountered costs for the use of a checkin machine at any airport apart from this flight was on time aircraft clean quiet and comfortable flight seats average only few travellers on this flight drinks and food for sale free checkin baggage very fast baggage delivery in tallinn airport

12499,jetstar asia,6,typical budget airline flight,jetstar is perhaps my least favorite among other low cost airlines operating in singapore but they offered a good option to fly from osaka to singapore via manila so we make the booking fast and efficient checkin japanese style in osaka airport 4 hours of flight to manila and then another 3 or so to singapore nothing special typical budget airline flight no entertainment system foodtobuy drinkstobuy but compared to the low fare it was just good enough basically its better to book them on shorter flights
6575,cathay pacific airways,4,the worst airline food,before covid cathay pacific used to be my favourite airline so i was so looking forward to flying with them again as they are known to now be trying to get back to normal however while the cabin crews and flight crews did a fabulous job the food was simply awful in fact i would go so far as to say its the worst airline food i have ever had in my 40 years of flying both short and long haul otherwise to be fair flights were punctual and inflight entertainment very good however sorry cathay but i could not face such awful food again and am forced to switch to japan airlines singapore airlines or emirates from australia to europe

16131,play,3,just too uncomfortable,never again will i fly this airline the seats are uncomfortable and the cabin was so hot i was nauseous also the lack of wifi on such a long flight is untenable especially when flying with young children the staff was lovely but it was just too uncomfortable and expensive for what was offered
8401,edelweiss air,2,ridicously tight seating,las vegas to zurich with edelweiss air ridicously tight seating in economy class made this one of my least relaxing longhaul flights ever being a relatively standard size 190 cm i was surprised to find that i simply couldnt sit normally without my knees touching or rather pressing hard into the seat in front of me when the passenger in the row in front of me reclined his seat i felt like a sardine with badly hurting knees sleeping was completely impossible and hadnt it been for the nice and friendly crew and the above average ife that helped kill the 10 hours i was wide awake it would have been my worst flight ever avoid this airline in economy class at all costs if youre taller than 165170 cm
18277,singapore airlines,7,very attentive and informative,we queued for checkin for 30 minutes staff were very good a chaotic and slow boarding process at the gate but when we entered the jet bridge it was very calm and welcoming with staff being very attentive and informative we had a problem with our star alliance flight the night before as it was cancelled so we were reallocated this flight singapore airlines gave us the front economy seat which had more leg room than any other flight it was on time and meals were served soon after take off meals were good as well as the rest of the flight
6517,cathay dragon,9,an excellent flight,hong kong to kolkata an excellent flight where i was doted on by two very amiable and helpful cabin crew members it helped that i was one of just two passengers in the business class section which had 8 seats in two rows of 2x2 a menu card was provided and my selection was tasty and filling a good complement of drinks and spirits was on offer however they have not changed their dessert a small cup of haagen daz ice cream in at least 7 years it is always served solid frozen i passed on it and had some port wine instead the flight departed on time from a satellite terminal which was reached by a short bus ride from the main terminal arrival was on schedule indian government landing cards required of foreigners were provided on board the seats are traditional business class recliners and were reasonably comfortable boarding was smooth intermixed with main cabin travelers through a jet way ipads with a small selection of films and shows were provided soon after take off it was difficult to slot them into the metal clasps on the back of the seat in front of you you needed to hold on to the ipad to watch your program magazines and newspapers on offer lots of storage space overhead leg space could be a tad extra once you recline fully your toes juts on the bottom of the front seat announcements were made in clear english and for a very thoughtful touch also in bengali the language of the destination city cathay dragon had a duty free catalog and three of my four selections were available for purchase this is one aspect of travel i very much enjoy as it lets me pick up last minute gifts
6519,cathay dragon,6,an unremarkable experience,kuala lumpur to hong kong the first leg of a trip to iad checkin at klia was very efficient and the checkin staff were very helpful the boarding process was handled well with cx staff on hand making clear announcements the plane was old and tired and the tray table was dirty stained with spilled food and orange juice on board the fas were pleasant and efficient but thats where it ended there was no personal interaction of any sort they did their jobs well and efficiently but thats it the food was disappointing small portions and not great in flavour the ife was good with an extensive choice of programs generally an unremarkable experience but we did leave on time
7903,cubana airlines,3,cubana airlines customer review,we flew out to holguin 24 hours late so we lost a days holiday the service was poor the food going out wasnt too bad but the only drink we had was served with the meal apart from water the inflight entertainment was non existent which isnt good on a 10 hour flight after a while the toilets were awful dirty with no soap or toilet paper staff didnt seem to care and had no interest in passengers the flight coming home was delayed 6 hours the food wasnt good cold meat and cheese for the main meal which was very dry and then for breakfast we were served a dry cheese and ham roll with no butter delays are apparently very common with cubana the flights spoilt what would have been a good holiday next time we will fly virgin
16530,qantaslink,7,qantaslink customer review,bnemkybne qantaslink flights but alliance airlines operated the sectors i was on this week so the flight standard should be viewed in that respect the fas on the brisbanemackay run were not good one with a terrible attitude especially towards other crew members which was unfortunately easy to witness however the return run from mackay to brisbane more than made up for the first leg due to exceptionally good cabin service including superb wines and very good ontime performance in the quick and quiet f100s
16652,regent airways,5,should improve their service attitude,singapore to dhaka flew with regent airways for the first time today is it the airline policy not to provide blankets to passengers i thought it was a given in any airlinethe staff mentioned to a male passenger it will be hot later on the plane so no need for blanket what kind of explanation is that paying for ticket is also paying for the service and goods within the airline for that period of travel for usage also the staff serving are not happy and dont smile they should improve their service attitude
5476,batik air,7,a big step up from lion,manokwari to surabaya via makassar checking in was chaotic with staff happily serving all those that jumped the queue and went straight to the front till i loudly protested them doing so twice flight left 20 minutes late due to check in not completed on time once on board things improved with decent entertainment and courteous crew however headsets had to be purchased for money and the girl serving my row gave us a random meal while passengers in other rows could choose from two meal on the first leg if the flight was good though on the 2nd leg it was just 2 cakes despite departing makassar on time we somehow reached surabaya half an hour late overall batik is certainly a big step up from lion but the crew needs more training
5500,batik air,6,food was just edible,perth to denpasar checkin at perth airport was fast and friendly business class passengers are invited to use the qantas lounge a simple breakfast was available boarding called after the queues had reduced so no waiting on boarding friendly welcome but not shown to seat offered pretakeoff juice departure was on time after seat belt sign turned off blankets and sony headsets were offered for entertainment and meal service commenced choice of vegetables with rice or chicken with rice tray was presented with cut fresh fruit chocolate cake hot meal and a glass of water metal cutlery provided food was just edible no coffee or tea service apparently no milk available on board anyway meal trays were cleared away quickly no further service offered entertainment was ok 18 english language movies plus a number of foreign language movies could not access music no alcohol offered and not available only water juice and pepsi were available call bells were answered in seconds crew were smiling but not engaging indonesian arrival forms only provided after being asked seat comfort was excellent and although not lie flat the seat was fully adjustable arrival on time remote stand used a private mini bus for business class to terminal arrival formalities completed quickly and luggage appeared around half an hour after landing batik air although marketed as full service and clearly they are not they are priced lower than the other indonesian carrier operating the same route
1465,air china,9,crew attentive and pleasant,i took biz class flight from beijing to taipei the overall service was good but i ordered a fruit platter and that was a very basic one the presentation was not good and the fruit quality was not either but the crew was attentive and pleasant i hope air china can improve the food as there is only so much a crew member can do to make up the overall customer experience air chinas aircraft and seatings in biz class are on the par with some airlines
7723,croatia airlines,9,croatia airlines customer review,bcnzagsjj on a319q400 checkin at bcn poor you in fact use lufthansas desks which is inefficient auto machines followed by bag drop but no reference anywhere to use it after problems at bcn we left late good cold dinner served onboard with nice croatian wine worn out a319 curtains closed for business class despite it being empty arrived only 10 mins late short transit at zag where everything was closed despite all the flights arrivingdeparting at that time prop flight to sarajevo comfortable and quick just 35mins on brand new q400 snack and drink served onboard efficient and friendly staff throughout one of the best flights ive had with this airline over the years they seem a bit hit and miss irrespective of domestic or international flights
18263,singapore airlines,1,very friendly and attentive,the crew members were very friendly and attentive especially when my friend felt uncomfortable and vomited they provided considerate care which i am very appreciated
3753,akasa air,4,you feel something is missing,although the aircrafts are new and inside decor is set in vibrant colors the moment you step into the cabin you feel something is missing the crew with the exception of the male steward neither looked welcoming not hospitable they seemed to be going through the motions and there was no warmth in their demeanour i traveled with family from bangalore to mopa airport in goa on 6th jul there was another problem with this airline they accepted bookings for a flight that they didnt operate they choose to put me on an earlier flight qp1392 instead of qp1398 i incurred an additional charge for the return flight with another airline since they informed on their only 2 weeks ahead of departure highly unethical for them to accept bookings in such manner the 4 in my rating is more for the equipment and airfare neither their website nor helpline nor ground staff pass the muster
9500,firefly,7,cabin crews were attentive,kota bahru to subang this was my second time on firefly the first was the journey from szb to kbr earlier in the day the flight was delayed supposed to depart at 845 pm but only by 930 pm that the plane left the airport notwithstanding the flight was okay all the way to szb the cabin crews were attentive and landing was smooth
10641,goair,1,their horrible service,bangalore to kochi i did not fly at all because of their horrible service first they cancel the flight and notify with just an sms and email no calls second they give you 2 phone numbers and ask you to call no matter how long you hold the call they wont receive it i even tried their airport numbers they just ignored the calls third they mention in the email that they can rebook the ticket for us but the reality is different they just refund you the amount and we have to start looking for another flight and because the flight was cancelled just 36 hrs before travel i had to cough up 5 times the money i paid originally for this budget airline there goes my budget
14480,malaysia airlines,4,aircraft needs serious upgrades,this is my usual route very short flight within 30 minutes the flight was delayed for 50 minutes everything seems normal but the aircraft needs serious upgrades the seat is not comfortable at all luckily the flight is short again the aircraft needs a serious upgrade other than that the crew was super friendly they assist other passengers well i also notice in this flight the crew explains very details to the passenger who seat at the emergency exit with proper explanations clarify i am not seating at the emergency exit seat but in a row behind it
21754,virgin america,6,no lounge in sfo,newark to san francisco i am trying to return home on eve of a major storm i usually fly ua but not satisfied with their service including 1st class so i thought give virgin america a try i am on a paid 1st cl ticket and flight out ok food very good seat not lie flat but fine for length of flight one complaint no lounge in sfo i am at the moment trying to make a change to an earlier flight to avoid getting stuck by cancellation the online link to modify it in is dead and have been on hold for 45 the press one for call back option is also dead i realize it is a mess for them with merger as well as storm warning in progress but one reason i fly 1st is for better service in this kind of service and btw no lounge in ny airports
21056,tuifly,7,tuifly customer review,colognefunchal return economy class holiday flight with hot breakfast 2 choices and one extra drink round flight was on time and baggage was in at right time seats are narrow for a 4hr trip but ok no avod but film was shown on overhead screens they charge for earphones plane a b737800 in old colour return flight full and we had seats 2cd also 2 hot meal choices and one extra drink turn baggage took ages in cgn but since flight was ahead of time no problem seats again narrow and do not recline much plane had new colour 737800 again on both flights crew were nice and did their best
16857,royal air maroc,6,seats in business class are the best,the flight was a red eye which are always stressful on passengers and crew the seats on the ram 787 in business class are the best i have experienced i am 192 cm and can lie easily flat the cabin crew were below average catering was disappointing though the portions were generous but never reflective to the rich moroccan heritage except for the moroccan tea ife was awful with a very poor selection of movies tv and games
17621,saudi arabian airlines,3,customer service is nearly not existing,customer service is nearly not existing a whatsapp number is provided but the wait to be served can be hours when you receive a reply if you dont respond within the minute your request is closed and you have to do all other again so nearly impossible to get through the system similar experience on the phone when you do get through including by raising an official complaint on the system you get told it is resolved but when checking it is not and the loop starts again this is the main issue im facing but overall food quality is below average plans are not very clean and prices are therefore high for what you get im now waiting for over an hour at the head office only customer service center waiting to get served for over 1 hour
9103,eurowings,7,not bad for a low fare carrier,we had booked a smart fare and were pleased with the extra legroom and effective priority boarding though the seat was a little hard for a 3 hrs plus flight the plane operated 45 mins late the queues for checkin and to get into the departure lounge were long and slow partly due to eurowings justified attempts to weed out oversize cabin luggage the smooth process of boarding and stowing cabin baggage made up for the earlier queues strangely after one pass through the cabin to sell refreshments the cabin crew disappeared for the rest of the 3 hrs plus flight at hamburg the plane was met by buses but the disembarkation process was smooth overall eurowings was not bad for a low fare carrier comparable with jetstar and a cut above ryan air
17571,sata air azores,3,undue stress and frustration,we travelled on flight s4301 from lisbon to toronto on feb 10th firstly the entertainment system did not work on our flight to lisbon on jan 7th and still was not working on feb 10th flight most importantly we never check baggage when flying however sat azores limits cabin baggage to 8 kg so we reluctantly checked two small bags weighing approx 10 kg each arriving in toronto the whole flights luggage did not arrive on carousel 9 for 15 hrs other flights landed after us and had baggage on carousels before they got thru customs eg georgetownport of spain miami and reykjavik 15 hrs to get luggage is totally unacceptable no one can leave for a connecting flight without taking luggage thru customs this caused undue stress and frustration for the whole flight
4920,avelo airlines,1,never again,avelo airlines began service out of palm springs last november i needed to travel to eugene or for business so decided i would give them a try i was scheduled to depart at 130 pm early that morning i began receiving emails from avelo advising the departure time had been delayed over the course of the day i continued to get successive emails 8 emails in all moving the departure later and later each time the flight finally departed at approximately 900 pm a total delay of 75 hours late the gate agent said she had no idea why the flight was so late and once on board the pilot only apologized for the inconvenience the delay was not due to weather so no one really knows why bottom line i gave avelo my business once but never again
6192,brussels airlines,4,would never take again for a long flight,lisbon to geneva via brussels with brussels airlines flight attendants were strict and unhappy no snacks or water served on 3 hour flight everything served was extremely expensive and unreasonable had to personally go to cabin to get cup of water would never take again for a long flight landing was very unsatisfactory very bumpy and wing tipped
7158,citilink,8,flight attendants were very courteous and polite,pkubdo qg 982 using a320 registration pkgqq was planning to fly from pekanbaru to bandung with air asia but they stopped their service on that route and have to switch to citilink garuda indonesia junior citilink is a lowcost subsidiary of garuda and so during booking have to pay additional for seats and inflight meals but the price is still reasonable so was able to secure seats in the first row i was not hoping for much from a low cost carrier but the experience turned out to be quite good checkin was quick and with standard baggage allowance per person 20kg 44 at no additional cost airplane was brand new airbus 320 with leather seats flight attendants were very courteous and polite and they were also very helpful we paid for our meals but turns out for drinks we also have to pay extra on board and it is cash only restrooms were kept clean throughout the trip flight deck communication was adequate we were given informations on flight time and altitude before we take off and arrival time and bandung weather before we land delightfully surprised that their hard and soft products were better than expected for a low cost carrier and if they are as aggressive in their expansion they can give air asia a run for their money would use again if coming back to the area and recommended for people who wants a nofrills flight with good service quality
9529,firefly,5,firefly customer review,in 2008 we flew from penang to langkawi and were overall satisfied with the flight short delay so in december 2013 we decided to book again for a flight from bangkok to kota bharu in january they called to switch the dates of our flight because the monday flight was cancelled in april they called again to cancel the flight destination because of the political situation in bangkok this seems a bit strange to me since other airlines still fly out of bangkok i think its more economical reasons now i have to wait 30 days to get my money back and book a flight through kl that is almost three times as expensive so beware before you book with them
2579,air new zealand,7,not common sense to be offering snacks on disembarkation,it is not common sense to be offering snacks on disembarkation absolutely ridiculous space issues people with needs such as parents with babies toddlers etc passengers needing to connect with other flights either offer the in flight service or dont simple
7441,condor airlines,4,dont think ill fly condor again,this was my second flight with condor the first was two years ago and went fine this scheduled flight was frankfurt to seattle via las vegas the crew at the gate were disastrous no announcements were made except to notify people that seats were available to upgrade at a reduced price even though people were queuing up to board in the line that was for a passport check which resulted in boarding beginning 40 minutes late business class and premium economy board from the same lane at the same time however when in line i was told business class first fair enough then they called for premium when i tried to board then the lady told me no business class first this happened twice more the flight was then delayed for more than 2 hours for an engine repair seems like something that should have been caught earlier sitting in our seats for two hours with no air conditioning was unpleasant and the crew never offered even water to make up for the inconvenience of the delay everyone on the flight was offered access to the premium entertainment which was nice but for those in business class or premium who already had that access that didnt mean much flight was fine once we got going because of the delay we missed our connection to seattle i was pleasantly surprised that condor did actually take care of things for us on this end because we booked with them directly they rebooked us for the next morning covered the hotel food vouchers and transportation tofrom the hotel ground service in frankfurt was terrible but the assistance in las vegas was pleasant overall i dont think ill fly condor again
6435,caribbean airlines,3,cabin was tired and dirty,this should have been one review as i purchased a ticket from georgetown through to toronto however on arrival in trinidad we were told we would have to deplane and change aircraft in any other airport it would be simple not in trinidad zero ground staff and we waited in a queue for 30 minutes and only after i asked were we advised that the boarding pass printer was down finally had to issue new boarding passes why then go through security again and head to the gate i had found out my seat was changed to a window from an aisle and trinidad gate agent said no other aisles available but on boarding i saw the emergency exit was free he lied flight left 20 minutes late and captain said it was a mechanical issue but a pax boarded at departure so was it mechanical seat cushion was nonexistent and cabin was tired and dirty also greeted in y by a nasty flight attendant who started to harangue me for putting duty free in the overhead bin as it could fall out a simple move of the bags already there fixed that potential issue flight attendant watched and scowled as i sorted out the bags and solved her stacking issue so much better to give crap to customers than fix the problem 75 minutes after take off lunch arrives i have never seen anything so gross in my life just serve nothing if this is the best you can do no pre meal beverage service only done at the same time as the so called meal after meal waited over an hour for pick up of the tray and no after dinner beverages offered this was a nearly 6 hour flight no service for 2 hours and no warning that feature movie was going to start of course no request to lower blinds so couldnt see tiny overhead screens anyway they say free entertainment but no headsets provided bar service 90 minutes from toronto and later the ridiculous and old fashioned warning to turn off phones and ipads as landing soon hello it doesnt matter on us or canadian aircraft why on caribbean airlines to top it off took 60 minutes for bags to arrive in toronto i love caribbean airlines ad campaign in georgetown with slogan demand value really as a customer how about demanding a smile or two maybe crew was so miserable as they were missing carnival
2836,air seychelles,3,delighted to end our flight,johannesburg to praslin via mahe with air seychelles our flight departure time was at 14h00 and the arrival time in mahe very close to midnight from johannesburg the service was extremely slow as our trays were cleared more than an hour after the service commenced i will not even comment on the food served as my tray went straight to their exit bin the departure time from johannesburg is clearly problematic if one considers the crew on duty had just come from seychelles and with a turnaround of possibly an hour or less they must have been on duty from very early morning it would be interesting to know whether the same crew returns the aircraft or whether there was indeed another crew returning to seychelles if a different crew did duty on the return flight then their tardy service is unforgiveable if the reverse is true then surely their hours on duty exceeded the norm for folk travelling from south africa and seated in the economy class sleep well the night before your departure do not try and extend your seat and then expect the passenger behind you to be happy having a stranger sleeping on their lap when service starts you have to be asked to please place your seat in the upright position on our return the menu was just as terrible fancy being told they do not have the omelette which is first on their very fancy menu card and your choice is frittata or bread pudding for breakfast the service was better the crew were well trained but the noise from passengers and children was chronic we at times wished their was an escape route and a parachute available we have travelled to many destinations on various flights longer flights do deserve the extra charges which we willingly pay but never have we been so delighted to end our flight mahe airport is in serious need of better seating and air conditioning being the departure point from all the islands praslin airport was cleaner and better equipped
1178,air canada,6,dinner service was a bit shambolic,late departing montreal which according to the captain during an announcement was because some meals still needed to be loaded on board chief purser later told me that there are bunch of things that we didnt get today which means that us the passengers wont have those dinner service was a bit shambolic with the cabin crew in business class seeming uncoordinated and disjointed my main course arrived barely warm so i asked that it be heated up again it returned quite some time later dried out it certainly wasnt a meal id have expected in a premium cabin on a major carrier what i have learned about this particular route is that the back of the business cabin is preferred by some customers who have their adult children sitting in the next cabin back premium economy such that the adult child can frequently come up to the business cabin to check on their elderly parent i met a premium economy passenger in the second j class galley who said he booked his elderly parents seat that way in order to be able to check on them during the flight what this means for other passengers is a constant flow of people coming from premium economy to check on mummy up in business class it makes the cabin feel busy and noisy and one has to endure great long chats between adult child and hardofhearing mummy about how to maneuver mommys seat etc i have about eight such passengers around me and feel like im in a flying nursing home
8953,etihad airways,8,large legroom for economy,large legroom for economy seats attentive cabin crew clean cabin and toilets and a very helpful call center the food and in flight entertainment are not bad but can be improved more
15019,niki,8,niki customer review,cphvienna return over the christmas holiday the plane and cabin was simple but comfortable flight attendants were cheerful and polite and information from the cockpit was good they gave us a complimentary sandwich and drink which many of the major european airlines do not do anymore we were able to check one bag for free all of this for 110 euros per person
1554,air dolomiti,5,air dolomiti customer review,recently i experienced my first flight with air dolomiti and first time on an embraer from frankfurt to verona the boarding was punctual embraer is a nice plane and i enjoyed the fact that the seats are 2 by 2 only the service onboard very professional it was a flawless flight
22395,volaris,1,not worth the cheaper ticket,mexico city to houston never use this airline cheap flight cost means no service the information given at the airport is never correct the website on the phone should update with gate information and it does not the people at the counters have no idea what they are doing or any regard for foreign travelers we spent the time between our connecting flights running back and forth between gates when we asked about the correct gate the staff responded irritated that we were asking definitely not worth the cheaper ticket price for the hassle we experienced
12914,klm royal dutch airlines,1,vegetarian meal did not have salt,klm collaborates with indigo for domestic transport in india indigo airlines forced me to check in the cabin bag and did not attach bag tag the flight was delayed and baggage came 40 minutes late i called indigo for 8 days straight and in the last they said klm should be responsible so i went to klm and they said indigo should be helping you with the claim if you are not going to take responsibility for who you partner with then it is lack of customer service also the asian vegetarian meal did not have salt
19496,swoop,1,yes believe the bad reviews,well i was warned yes believe the bad reviews our original flight out of abbotsford was supposed to be in after nine then they moved it to 105 pm i am literally sitting here now theyve now just delayed it again they said because they cant find the deicer truck or the driver to drive it nice these people have basically ruined my vacation i already had to change airlines on the way home because swoop could meet their criteria to pick us up do yourself a favour spend the extra money and go westjet andor any other airline do not i repeat do not let the cheapness of this airline fool you they will ruin your vacation
20804,transaero airlines,2,transaero airlines customer review,lhrdme we flew an ageing 737 the plane was packed and everyone had a lot of hand luggage so there was little room for storage cabin crew were completely indifferent to boarding passengers and did their best to ignore them absolutely no assistance was offered the steward at the front of the plane used his position to glare at everyone departure was delayed for about an hour of course no announcements we were offered a soft drink and that was the last liquid we saw for the next 35 hours one got the impression that the cabin crew had decided that it wasnt worth the bother of attending to passengers and they all walked about with morose and sulking expressions i would only ever consider transaero if the price was significantly lower
22009,vistara,9,really help a lot to get it clear,i was coming from usa and having connecting flight to lucknow at the time of baggage checking the staff shakshi helped me a lot as there was one bag extra and i have already paid for that but somehow its was not showing in their website this girl really help a lot to get it clear

17453,sa express,5,sa express customer review,cptjnbcpt economy i booked 3 days before departure for a quick return trip i would have travelled saa in preference to the other carriers but after booking i compared prices between saa and the four other domestic carriers and comparing similar timings saa was the least expensive zar 1565 admittedly not by much but so much for low cost carriers when i saw the long check in queues for the other carriers at ctia i was even happier to have booked saa simply drew my boarding card after checking in online and sauntered to the boarding gate flights were punctual lots of information from the flight deck cabin crew attentive and friendly modern clean aircraft and decent seat pitch
1399,air china,3,crew were cold and abrupt,newark to mumbai via beijing the seats are small on one flight if you had empty seats next to you you couldnt move the arm rest to recline most of the crew were cold and abrupt it seemed if i asked for something i was bothering them you would think the food would be good it wasnt no frills cheap cold sandwiches and rice and meat with seaweed and imitation fish i was seated next to a male that wanted to flirt it seemed since i was very uninterested he just leaned and leered the whole flight instead i moved to the 2 empty seats next to me and a stewardess can over and told me the seats were for the crew which they didnt use halfway through the 13hr flight a couple attempts to use the seats they saw me alert the flight attendant and then change their story saying she was sick she was allowed to stay there which was rubbish on my first leg of me trip i had to stand for most of my 13hr flight the price was good and you get what you pay for next time i will afford better
19979,thai airasia,7,on time no hassle flights,don mueang to udon return with thai airasia had previously checked in online so only had to collect my boarding pass at the machine no checked bags so check in took 2 minutes another few minutes at security then the long walk dmk domestic can involve a long walk to from the gate boarding was reasonably well organised by aft forward zones there was priority boading for those who paid extra presumably allowing them to stow their oversized cabin bags for less than the cost of the bag being checked in flights were on time both fullfull didnt bother with a meal from the fairly disinterested cabin crew and neither did most of the passengers checkin in udon was the same a couple of minutes at the machine assisted by helpful staff excellent price on time no hassle flights whats not to like
18233,singapore airlines,9,special praise for air stewardess,i would like to give special praise for air stewardess nurul who served me at the premium economy cabin she has been very proactive in asking and suggesting drinks and snacks to eat throughout the trip very friendly good listener and very conversant
8458,egyptair,2,no one from the crew cared,the airline staff in jeddah made more than one mistake 1 they split the passengers and forced them to another delayed flight 2 they lied by saying the first flight is cancelled while it was on 3 they had another time listed in the boarding pass to avoid conferring with customers 4 they failed to share any of the above unless you step up and ask for more information 5 they didnt have enough team on the ground to handle the boarding 6 everyone felt they are being treated badly and no one from the crew cared to help or explain the situation
21020,tuifly,5,seats were so horrendous,on december 15th me and my partner flew from curacao to amsterdam with a stop at aruba on a boeing 767300er of tuifly netherlands checkin was quick but due to a late arrival of the aircraft boarding started late passengers to amsterdam had to board first while the passengers from amsterdam to aruba were asked to board second and fill up the remaining unassigned seats the flight to aruba was very quick only 20 minutes and no serviced was provided due to the short flight time at aruba the passengers to amsterdam were asked to remain seated while the aircraft was prepared for its last leg to amsterdam after 90 minutes on the ground we departed slightly later then planned to amsterdam the seats were extremely narrow this 767 was equipped with a 242 configuration instead of the designed 232 configuration legroom was good because we booked comfort class a pitch of 33 inch but the seats werent equipped with head rests the interior looked also very dated due to the old overhead bins the entertainment system was fine with a limited but good selection of movies and television series after takeoff dinner was served chicken with onion sauce which was not very good with a nonalcoholic drink service after which coffee or tea were served the lights were dimmed it was a night flight and two hours before arrival breakfast was served a croissant with a yoghurt and a drink to conclude the cabin crew was great polite and very professional but to be honest the seats were so horrendous that i would not fly tui again on this aging 767
20500,thomson airways,8,was a good flight,flew thomson airways from stockholm to cancun this christmas with my family the airplane was clean and felt fresh boarding was swift and without delays the seats were nice as far as economy seats go after take off the cabin service started and progressed at a decent pace the dinner was really good and the personal inflight entertainment systems was great the flight was quite full so it was fairly loud but nothing out of the ordinary fas did their work well only real negative was the poor breakfast that was offered sort of a pasta salad that really wasnt something id like for breakfast all in all it was a good flight for an economy ticket there was a surprisingly large amount of included stuff i would fly thomson again
16961,royal brunei airlines,7,unpleasant checkin experience,unpleasant checkin experience which really spoiled the overall experience more than anything else first of all online checkin failed repeatedly and no help was forthcoming from the email address that the airlines website faqs directed questions on online check in errors to to this day i have never received a response to my email their online checkin system seems to be fundamentally broken since resumption of operations post covid therefore i went early to the airport 3 hours ahead of the scheduled flight time for manual checkin but found a long poorlymanaged queue the ground staff to whom royal brunei have subcontracted ground operations at heathrow terminal 4 were surly and disinterested the particular lady who handled our check in was rude asked the same question 3 times because she wasnt paying attention to our answers or to her job and was instead casually complaining to her colleague about not wanting to work overtime right in front of us rather than just getting on with the task at hand its very unprofessional to discuss work gripes in front of customers whom one is supposed to be attending to at that moment priority boarding for reserved seating was honoured though you have to listen carefully for the rushed announcements or youll miss the very short window given for priority boarding additional leg space for the reserved seating was good making the journey more comfortable the flight took off almost two hours late though the exact reason for this wasnt made clear to passengers and we had to wait on board during the delay cabin crew were very polite and helpful though overall the standard of service on royal brunei has declined compared to a decade ago eg no amenity kits were provided for this flight and only one meal was served on a seven and a half hour flight lhr to dxb it was tasty but the portion size was on the small side free snacks were available at the rear galley for those who went to get them but the cabin crew almost never came round with drinks except once with the meal service however they did always respond attentively to calls and were friendly and efficient the condition of the aircraft is very good complimentary toothbrushes were provided in the washrooms blankets and pillows provided for all seats the entertainment system had a wide variety of options though some were quite obscure and the system is not easy to navigate or search through headphones were not distributed from london and i had to ask for them they didnt actually carry enough headphones for all passengers on this flight which is shocking quality of the sound from the airlinesupplied headphones was poor
5809,blue1,4,blue1 customer review,helcph rj85100 clean quiet i like these aircraft good crew good service flight crew kept us informed about our journey routing and expected time of arrival no complaints
4721,aurigny air,4,need to change the way their website works,i booked my flight with aurigny air via skyscanner from london to guernsey or at least i thought i had until i arrived at check in and was informed that my flight destinations were swapped when i went to the help desk to change this she told me it would cost 125 more than my initial flight after i paid this i wondered how i could be so stupid to book the destinations the wrong way around to which the lady told me that it happens all the time because aurigny airs website always changes the destinations so the outbound flight is from guernsey even if you have been linked to aurigny airs website from another website like skyscanner with specific flights already selected when i arrived at guernsey and told some locals they agreed that it happens all the time and they have never heard of aurigny charging customers to change the flights as it is a fault of their website as for the actual flight it was pleasant and i enjoyed the complimentary drink even though the journey is only 35 mins and newspaper the staff were friendly and polite and seats were comfortable just be warned when using skyscanner to book your flights through this company as they really need to change the way their website works this seems to be a common and very expensive problem
11272,iberia express,9,i really recommend it,i flew from berlin tegel to madrid on february 18 the flight was on time and we arrived to madrid before the set time check in was fast too nice flight kind cabin crew good service and also confortable seats with spacious legroom i really recommend it

9893,flyone,1,late checkin is 30 euros per person,cheap and certainly not cheerful this airline is the worst airline i have ever flown if you are not extremely early in arriving at the checkin desk they refuse to provide you with your ticket unless you take a trip across the airport to a tax office and pay a fee of 30 euros they claim that this is a fee for late checkin the office where i had to pay the fee does not accept card payments i therefore had to travel again to another side of the airport to an atm wasting more time all in all it took me half and hour to sort this and i only made the flight because it was delayed also when paying the fee in turkish lira they then upthe price even further without telling us beforehand so we paid more in turkish lira than we would have paid in euros despite this being turkey the price for late checkin is 30 euros per person i thought it was suspicious when i was booking my ticket online and they automatically add pointless extras for an extra cost without you having asked for them so you have to navigate back through the booking form to uncheck all of the boxes
1568,air europa,7,it was good but not great,very busy flight but arrived according to schedule food and drinks available to buy seat was ok infotainment system worked but no earphones were provided so it was like silent films all in all it was good but not great
1591,air europa,3,do not recommend at all,lets start with a 8 hr flight and only one meal drinks served are really shot glasses its truly your europe spirit airlines from the point of contact at ticket agent not the most friendly but not rude on our way to spain the crew was once again not friendly and seemed upset if we asked for anything so now it became rude well i just shook it off as they must be tired i have been in travel industry for many yrs i was wrong on the way from spain to miami ticket agent not friendly took passports and reservation no smile no how are you just group number we were a group of 4 she gave us our tickets and neglected to even tell us she did not put us all together and put us all in the middle seat spread out okay maybe its a full flight so i let the flight attendant know i was interested in changing my seat he said sure but made no attempt to assist me when i went back to where my son was sitting i saw many seats available but once again i had all my stuff in my seat so i decided to stay in my seat later when i decided i needed some water i turned my light on to call for the flight attendant he then turned off my light several times without assisting me so i gave this airline a try but with this experience i have to say poor service do not recommend at all

5987,breeze airways,1,said we would be reimbursed,two nights before our flight out i received an email saying they were looking for 16 volunteers to cancel their trips because they had booked more guests then seats available on the plane a night later i received another email saying they still was looking for 11 people to cancel shortly after our flight got delayed 5 hours then delayed another 2 hours but they didnt tell us about the second delayed we got to the airport and every few minutes they told us it would be longer they took forever to board then plane and we were ridiculously late to where we needed to be flying home we got to the airport for a 730 flight which we didnt even board until after 8am the plane was small and uncomfortable we will never ever use breeze again so much better off spending money and having a reliable and comfortable flight safe to say we hated this airline also it is absolutely impossible to contact anyone working for breeze also said we would be reimbursed for our over 7 hour delay but that never happened either

21058,tuifly,1,tuifly customer review,paid eur 320 for a oneway cgncta uncomfortable seating not even providing a flexible pocket in the back of the seat in front of you if you can avoid to travel on tuifly i strongly recommend to do so especially their flights to the canarias egypt or israel worst seating i ever experienced at least we got a meal on board a bagel with one free nonalcoholic beverage if your flight time is less than two hours you have to pay for any food or drink tui profiles itself a high standard high quality travel agency its aircraft cant fulfil this demand in any possible way
8590,el al israel airlines,1,avoid at any costs,avoid at any costs if you have any self esteem they delayed the flight for hours without explanation ransacked the luggage without explanation and on top of it they treat the nonisraeli passengers like secondclass human beings the only ones to be targeted for random appalling checks and treated with the utmost lack of any politeness first and last time with this joke of a company

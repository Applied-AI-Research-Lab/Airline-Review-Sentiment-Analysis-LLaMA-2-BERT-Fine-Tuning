4897,avelo airlines,1,customer service is inadequate,if you ever have to cancel your flight they will conveniently lose your travel funds and youll never see them again i spent countless hours sending them the proof that they owed me travel funds and they just said that they couldnt find them and that it was the customers responsibility to keep track what a joke i sent everything that they had sent me how can i give them travel funds numbers to research whats owed to me if they never gave them to me in the first place customer service is inadequate and in accurate and they do not care if you are owed if they say they cannot locate your travel funds on their end it then you lose i will never ever fly avelo airlines again and if i am asked by anyone in my area how i like them i will always tell them the full story
2871,air seychelles,8,air seychelles customer review,cdgsezcdg good flight with b767300er the aircraft has a nice blue relaxing interior in pearl class and service was okay inflight entertainment system very simple and not very good cabin crew good and replying on anyones request food was better than expected seat was comfortable but not electronic powered i heard air seychelles is going to have a new ife and lie flat beds later in june
9345,fiji airways,9,i loved flying fiji airways,los angeles to sydney via nadi i loved flying fiji airways and i think it is absolutely value for money at the time i bought my return ticket sydney lax fiji airways was about 3040 cheaper than its competitors united qantas etc some reviews made me a bit hesitant to fly fiji airways but i am glad that i did the online checkin was easy and their ground personnel at the baggage drop counter was friendly and helpful also the boarding went smooth and all four flights i had departed on time on one of my flights just before takeoff a steward came to me and asked me whether i preferred to move to another seat that had an empty seat next to it because of my height 6 foot 6195 m i think this was very kind of him and in general i found the stewards on board very friendly and willing to help the food and the inflight entertainment was alright it may not be as fancy or shiny as the food and entertainment you get at huge airlines like emirates or qatar but for the money it was good value for the meals you had a vegetarian and nonvegetarian option and the inflight entertainment was sufficient again emirates may have a 150 movies to choose from and fiji only 30 but you cant watch them all anyway also the seats were fine and just like any other company besides maybe the more luxurious a380 seats i would really like to recommend fiji airways to fly with if you want a good value for money dont expect too much luxury but expect very friendly personnel food entertainment and seats that do the job and a company that brings you from a to b for 6070 of the price of their competitors
6456,caribbean airlines,8,caribbean airlines customer review,the lounge at jfk terminal 4 is well appointed and nicely laid out with a decent selection of drinks and food boarding was punctual we were seated in 1a and 1c a soft drink was offered before takeoff seats were leather and old style first class with adequate leg room shortly after takeoff we were offered drinks mot and chandon champagne and nuts caribbean airlines now offer you the chance to preorder your meal and i had chosen a tiger prawn masala with a vegetarian biryani for my partner without a doubt these were two of the best airline meals we have tasted drinks were topped up throughout the flight by crew who were delightful chatty pleasant and a pleasant change from the norm our saturday night flight landed 30 minutes early and we left relaxed and pleased with our choice
10793,hainan airlines,9,excellent service supplied,beijing to boston very impressed by the excellent service supplied by huang she is smiled and asked what i needed she answered all questions asked we really appreciate her service i enjoy this trip with hainan airlines
13662,level,6,get what you pay for,paris to fort de france level provides cheap long haul fares you can choose from a number of options during booking including baggage and meal options which raises the prices quite a bit after booking there was very little spam and hassle paris orly airport is a bad way to start your holiday since we deliberately did not book any food or drink options we brought plenty of foods and drinks and consuming those on board was not a problem we looked at the food that was pre booked and were surprised how small the portions were apart from that everything aboard the plane is on sale you dont get a pillow blanket or headphone but we were prepared for that crew running through the aisle serving food and drinks was a tad unnerving crew was very strict in enforcing rules ie one passenger stood up right after landing and crew immediately told him this next time they would call the police on him the seat was surprisingly comfortable with lots of leg room however we saw quite a few seats with gigantic entertainment boxes in the leg room entertainment system was free of charge movie choice seemed rather small for a long haul flight internet was available at a hefty price tag in total level is a very clear you get what you pay for airline and that is very little on both sides of the equation
18695,south african airways,8,a very pleasant flight,munich to johannesburghaving read some recent reviews about saa on skytrax i was a bit apprehensive about flying saa i booked economy but put in a bid for an upgrade to business and the offer was accepted business class configuration on the older a330200 aircraft looks a bit dated compared to the product on other airlines and newer aircraft but the seat reclined to a 180 degrees flat seat the bedding was comfortable lavatories were cleanthe cabin crew was very attentive four meals options were available with dessert and cheese selections wine selection from selection of south african vinyardsall meals served on porcellan breakfast is a choice of continental full english or fruit salad and cereals cabin lights were dimmed immediately after meal service so that seats could be reclined for sleeping those who wanted breakfast were woken an hour before landing on schedule arrival in jnb all in all a very pleasant flight even if the aircraft used was beginning to feel its age a bit
17131,royal jordanian airlines,6,food wasnt good,flew rj bkk to hkg last year and now to kul had a terrible checkin agent last time but a better lady now although quite slow boarding procedure was so annoying as monitors showed final call but the boarding hadnt even started could have spent more time in lounge i think i had the same fantastic fa last time she is really great the food wasnt good but the same chablis as last time was flowing with a big smile
656,afriqiyah airways,4,afriqiyah airways customer review,londontripolidakar returning in june much better than charter flights from paris or charters to gambia very few people on all legs of the flight meant that everyone could stretch out over 3 seats fast and efficient checkin i was told i could have taken 40kg but the ticket issued through last minutecom only said 23kg entertainment good western and arabic films interesting documentary and tapes of koran staff responsive but dont fuss laid back will give extra food plenty of drinks food all halal and morereal than that served on western flights but the same on return delay at gatwick but they held all connecting flights in tripoli planes modern and clean staff helpful and responsive in dakar in changing return flight for under 50 good cheap way to get to west africa this is an airline that caters for ordinary people and adequately meets those needs
2683,air nostrum,5,air nostrum customer review,basel via barcelona to granada the flights between basel and barcelona were operated by air nostrum although sadly since theyve stopped flying to basel i think their service is nothing short of amazing first of all on the return we were even given a hot meal this was in economy class and the flight is less than two hours generally the quality of the food is good and the service in economy class is more like what you get in business class on most airlines the flight attendants were very friendly which only made the contrast to the surly unfriendly bunch working for iberia seem even more unfriendly
14540,malindo air,7,good value for money,malacca to penang nice little airline from malaysia the short flight on this atr 72600 wasnt bad no wifi or any entertainment very nice food served there overall good value for money
4437,ana all nippon airways,9,very satisfied with ana,so i just basically did a round trip with ana between washington and tokyo the entire crew are awesome very polite and ready to help the food is extremely delicious and fresh with obviously japanese food focused my only complaints are with the seat and inflight entertainment after a couple of hours sleeping you definitely wake up with pain in your bottom the seating could be a little bit more comfortable the inflight entertainment could have more movies subtitled in english there were just a few subtitled in english but overall speaking im very satisfied with ana services i would definitely fly again with them
6324,bulgaria air,9,bulgaria air customer review,just completed my 4th flight between sofia and frankfurt over a 6 month period how pleasant it is to be sitting in a real business class seat 2 x 2 with room to spread and not having my notebook screen crushed by the seat in front with drinks before takeoff and charming crew all flights without exception have been right on time operated with new a319s i only wish theyd operate the route more frequently so i could use them both ways
21825,virgin america,9,the service was great,virgin america from washington dulles to san francisco the inflight entertainment was good and cabin crew very friendly the seat back monitors allowed you to order drinks right then and there the drinks are free and although the food is not the prices are very reasonable seats are comfortable as for leg room i am only 58 so i dont really have problems with leg room but from the looks of it somebody of average height would have a good amount of leg room the ground crew were nice and the checkin was smooth and fast the only remotely negative things about virgin america are that the remotes are a bit challenging to use just me being picky and that it is more expensive than most airlines for a transcontinental domestic flight with that being said though you get what you pay for and the service was great
16635,qatar airways,9,service was exceptional,the customer service was exceptional from the check in lounge on boarding the staff were very attentive and looked after us throughout the flight the food was good
13574,latam airlines,2,will be avoiding,flying as a family of 4 we purchased tickets from lima to buenos aires with a short layover in santiago leaving on 15th december latam changed our flight times repeatedly changing both the date of departure and the arrival airport leaving us with a 10 hour layover from the early hours which we had to endure sleepless and uncomfortable in santiago we were told we could change the flights if we werent happy but there were none available latam were not interested in the fact they had changed the date of travel had added a long overnight layover in spite of the fact we had originally paid extra to avoid that we were all exhausted upon arrival plus the usual inedible flight food and i will be avoiding this airline in future
1968,air italy,3,i literally was trapped,new york jfk to rome via milan first ticketing counter very inconvenient counter locations at the airport the farthest counter from everything around the corner and hidden behind all other counters that you actually have to ask someone to locate by the way they do not affiliate with air italy first i thought it was just at jfk but to my surprise it was the same setup in rome seems like they picked the cheapest counters at the airport second leg room lets start with tight seats with no leg room they do not meet the standard requirements once the seat in front of me is reclined i literally was trapped and could not get up i could not even close the food tray that was jammed on my lap wanted to reach out to flight attendant for help but obviously couldnt reach out the overhead help button no one walked by for hours until dinner time but even then she was not able to help as if people in economy do not matter at all i understand that they have to treat upper class customers better but they cannot ignore economy class to that level third baggage fee no charge for luggage from us to rome but they hit you with no luggage allowed policy for economy unless you pay 100 euro each as if its not the same bag came on the flight in to rome why charge only one leg of the flight when i refused the pay they referred me to the supervisor who finally showed up after half an hour but was not helpful at all in fact she was extremely rude and pretty much said to us this the way it is whether you like or not
4689,asky airlines,3,the worst experience,while in transit from lome to abuja on the 10th september we boarded the flight as one of the last passengers and traveling as a family we got a bad vibe from a particular staff on the flight that same staff and another staff due to the staff them not focusing on the job at hand she accused us of stealing a mug from the airline and she started causing drama saying all sorts of things in french which we could not understand we asked her to verify but she would not and just went on talking trash this is the worst experience i have ever had while traveling and after my return i hope to never fly with asky again unless an action is taken towards the behavior of their staff
975,air bagan,5,air bagan customer review,took two domestic flights on air bagan one from yangon to bagan and another mandalay to yangon both flights were with atr72 aircraft the interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space the aircraft definitely showed its old age the flight from mandalay to yangon was free seated and flight was completely full the inflight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy for both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail air bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today
19114,srilankan airlines,1,the hard product was sound,check in at lhr was fine 35 hours prior to departure security quick srilankan dont have their own lounge but was able to use the ba and qantas lounges both were fine easy to get shower in ba lounge the quantas lounge was more spacious flight boarding was fine welcome with usual fare the hard product was sound good chair lie flat movies good and wide selection dinner service bit disorganised but the food chicken curry was good i slept well the big issue with this flight is the very tight connection time 40 mins i expected the worst especially as we had a 20 minute delay they did fine off the london flight and staff directed us to the next flight which waited for us our baggage made it too overall i would use again
18765,southwest airlines,1,dont fly with this airline,i cant fly to chicago for two days due to a rescheduled flight for the first time we got on a plane and everyone just dropped us off and said that you were leaving tomorrow and the next day they promised a direct flight to chicago but again they outplayed everything and changed the flight 34 hours before departure now i need to fly with a transfer to dallas i paid money for this is this an airline or a taxi on call if you are saving your time dont fly with this airline
23041,xl airways france,1,i highly recommend this airline,after flying the 1155 pm xl airways france flight from new york jfk to paris and returning a week later i have to say this was the best airline i have flown it was a new plane seats were tight like all economy flights but i was fairly comfortable staff was very friendly and the flight took off and landed on time both trips the meal was pretty good and they walked around constantly offering free water throughout the flight they had drinks but i was okay with water the movies were in french but i slept so it didnt matter i spent half what i would have on any other flight and it would have been a waste the flight was perfect and i highly recommend this airline
633,afriqiyah airways,7,afriqiyah airways customer review,brujnbbru with a stopover in tripoli there were some troubles with the inflight entertainment on our way to jnb there were not enough headsets so we couldnt use the inflight entertainment on our way back from jnb to tripoli the inflight entertainment in our part of the plane didnt work at all the food was okay and the cabin crew friendly its definitely value for money but there are some things to improve
21928,virgin australia,7,staff were friendly and helpful,check in was straightforward and the plane left on time staff were friendly and helpful all food and drink except coffee tea and water had to be purchased which was no big deal as the flight was about two hours
16656,regent airways,4,mannerless attitude,unprofessional mannerless attitude we flew from dhaka to coxs bazar at new years eve due to govt election flight was delayed 15 hours but they didnt mention that before after sitting on the aircraft we came to know about that we were stuck into the flight for all that time the ground staffs behaviour was nice and professional but the cabin crew acted like they are also some guest passengers there even after asking for newspaper they didnt even bother to manage one
21775,virgin america,3,bad attitude by gate agent,los angeles to seattle really poor service and bad attitude by gate agent unnecessarily gave me a hard time despite being first class unfriendly staff attendants that kept complaining about becoming part of alaska and how different the culture between the two airlines is lounge was cramped and hardly had any good food
16371,qantas airways,1,no customer service whatsoever,qantas has gone from best to worst airline in the world to be avoided at all costs no customer service whatsoever promised to reply to our generous bid for upgrades no reply upon complaining they said we applied for wrong leg of flight when confronted with evidence they said flight was full
21887,virgin australia,5,didnt provide us with a snack for free,i just paid 950 for a flight from perth to sydney its over 4 hour flight and they didnt even provide us with a snack for free i strongly believe they should provide passengers a meal on this long flight especially when you are over charging i will definitely be giving business to qantas who provide free meals on the longer flights in australia
5372,bangkok airways,9,definitely a boutique airline,bangkok airways is charging very steep prices for a route they have a monopoly on and takes only about an hour and 15 minutes to complete in an older atr 72500 in which you definitely can notice the age airport is quite a distance from mandalay and you are required to enter through security prior to checkin checkin was slow but were welcomed by a friendly agent who invited us to use their lounge bangkok airways is definitely a boutique airline that offers complimentary drinkssnacks at certain airports for their economy passengers too lounge was ok with a limited snack offer hot food and alcohol you would be charged for boarding was slightly late and went by stairs to ground welcomed by two lovely cabin crew and took only 15 minutes to get airborne complimentary meal provided with drinks cold unfortunately as there is no galley in an atr landing was hard but on time and we were quickly through customs
18233,singapore airlines,9,special praise for air stewardess,i would like to give special praise for air stewardess nurul who served me at the premium economy cabin she has been very proactive in asking and suggesting drinks and snacks to eat throughout the trip very friendly good listener and very conversant
7860,cubana airlines,4,service even more basic,departure from toronto march 31st started off with the check in desks not being ready when i arrived but they set up a little later didnt appear to be any issues with the departure time of 1250 flight ok service ok basic notice no movie screens no ear phones issued no pillows or blankets provided flight went smoothly and arrived at scu on time return was another story entirely ive noted from other reviews that cubana appears to have developed a steady pattern which may now be a practice of not being on time major delays and very poor to no information being communicated to passengers yes airlines experience delays and equipment problems but in this day and age what continues to happen with both of these companies is not acceptable so for the return the 605 departure on april 7th from scu was originally on time but then it was delayed no explanation as to why at approx 730 or 8 an official came into the departure lounge and passengers went to speak with him to find out what was going on we were told the flight wouldnt be leaving until 3 am we asked about being taken out of the airport and accommodated for more comfort etc due to the length of the wait and were told no we asked about food and refreshments and were told that was being organized the timing of the departure changed 3 more times after that moving to 10pm and 11pm that night and then finally an empty jet arrived at 1220 rumour had it that there was a problem with the flight coming down from toronto and it had to turn back same thing with a flight that was allegedly coming from havana we were also told that they had to get permissions in place for our plane to land at toronto in the wee hours of the morning eg 230am once the empty jet landed and we loaded we took off at 130 am service even more basic than the flight coming down drinks and a snack were served but nothing else no duty free offered and again no earphones no movie screens no pillows or blankets we flew without any incident landing in toronto at 530 am a lot of passengers had to miss work school that day because of the toll all of that drama took again by this point in time cubana and hola sun seriously need to pull up their socks and change their ideas and approach towards their schedules and their approach especially with regard to providing better communications and information to the travelling public there are limited airlines that fly into santiago but that doesnt mean cubana has any sort of monopoly and can treat passengers like that
18086,silkair,6,movie and entertainment choices limited,bandung to singapore with silkair the food was good we had fresh salmon for our lunch you need to use your personal devices in order to connect to the onboard entertainment system movie and entertainment choices limited the aircraft looked old and interior not so great compare with the newer cabins
3374,airasia philippines,9,cannot fault their service,davao to manila swift checking again having used this airline many times when travelling internally in the philippines and i cannot fault their service crew are always friendly cabin always clean more so price wise very competitive
10113,frontier airlines,1,has been the worst flight experience,we booked a flight straight back to cincinnati and this has been the worst flight experience dont ever fly with frontier we knew they were bad ie dont offer food for a three hour flight unless you pay dont let you have a jacket inhand unless you are carrying it but they were incredibly cheap so against our better judgement we booked it it got delayed for 2 hours and as were in line we get an email saying its cancelled do not fly with frontier
14675,meridiana,7,would fly meridiana again,although meridiana is very basic we had great experiences flying new york jfk to naples and back a few weeks ago check in was quick and efficient at both airports and they let me check my somewhat large although within allowance carryon free of charge both ways the seats though are tiny im 510 and my boyfriend is 61 and if we had known we would have paid extra for the comfort seats with extra legroom for a long flight to italy this was not ideal but i should have done my homework so i cant blame the airline the plane was a boeing 767 both ways and was old and sort of dirty but quiet and it was a smooth flight both ways the food was fine on the way into naples but on the way home it was atrocious the flight crew is totally uninvolved and stays at the back of the plane for the duration of the flight but when they did come around for meals and beverages they were pleasant enough the movies were corny romantic comedies but dealable all in all i got what i paid for a 600 round trip ticket to italy is not something im going to complain about the trip there was better than the trip home but i would fly meridiana again in the future for the value alone
22740,wizz air,8,the flight itself was provided,efficient boarding it was complete almost 20 minutes before departure time then we waited in the airplane 45 minutes because of some airspace restrictions landing was about 5 minutes behind schedule cabin crew stick to the rules and no seat change was permitted as usual no free catering and nothing else but the flight itself was provided the promise to take us from a to b was fulfilled
15988,philippine airlines,4,flight attendants are very hospitable,we were served 2 meals for my 9 hour flight and the serving is i would say is complete flight attendants are very hospitable and willing to help for the negatives crowded leg space for economy class for their dxbmnl flights they are using the same crowded aircraft for many years and not one ounce of this have improved im stuck with the same airline over and over again because its my employer who chooses the flight and not me not only the leg spaces are crowded the inflight entertainment is inconvenient they have but you have to download an app for it on your mobile and connect to the aircraft wifi while thats not a bad idea this consumes battery and seats dont have charging slots it feels like they never considered improving their middle east flights since most passengers are filipino expatriates but of course their flights going to countries such asus canada uk australia are way better better leg space and actual screens for inflight entertainment not to mention all of my flights to dubai from manila are late 12 hours delayed
12771,kenya airways,8,i had a pleasant flight,after booking my ticket i was very much afraid of all the negative reviews i have read but fortunately i had a pleasant flight both flights departure was on time luggage was received in good condition only thing that can be improved may be the food some extra items can be added
6607,cathay pacific airways,8,satisfied with the trip,the flight was about 60 occupied the economy class seats are just alright about the same as other airlines the entertainment is nice screen is large plenty of moviesshows and documentaries the cabin crew are responsive and quick to approach me when i pressed the bell for help meals are pretty good i also bought the wifi which cost 20 us dollars for the 2hr 40 mins flight the service quality is about the same prepandemic all in all im satisfied with the trip overall
14490,malaysia airlines,7,a reasonable flight,kullhr on 20 october in economy plus which means extra legroom in front of the economy cabin boarding in kl was well managed and the aircraft left on time the cabin crew were pretty much absent on boarding but the purser of the flight was very amiable and friendly and went out of his way to greet passengers and chat to them a shout to rufus the purser who even lent me his personal charging cord and plug when mine failed he went out of his way to assist cabin service was efficient but staff didnt really interact with the passengers but remained pleasant and cheerful the ife was poor big screens good resolution but disappointing content the seat was comfortable and there was plenty of legroom the food was awful very small portions and not tasty their signature nasi lemak was very disappointing but they did serve two full meals and one minuscule tuna roll midflight the fas kept is well watered but alcohol choices were poor and not made clear to passengers overall this was a reasonable flight and everything went smoothly apart from the food which could be much better
6170,brussels airlines,7,it was a good flight,it was a good flight and the cabin crew was friendly and will try to help you if you have a question it was an a320 without entertainment i remember having more leg space in the a320s from vueling lowcost than i had with brussels airlines
8669,emirates,5,onboard internet simply does not work,the onboard internet simply does not work if you complain the supplier for emirates sita for aircraft simply refuse to acknowledge that they failed to provide a service and issue a refund it appears from multiple reviews that this happens often emirates themselves apart from the nonexistent internet and poor third party aftersales experience were pretty good ample leg room friendly staff good selection of movies but poor food choice fish or vegetables only the checkin was also poor i followed the check in signs for economy seats at dubai airport t3 waited for around 2030 mins before being told to check in at desk 5 flights to usa i wasnt flying to the usa how am i supposed to know to follow that sign very poor understanding of the customer journey
16123,play,9,planes are as clean as can be,brand new airbus planes that are as clean as can be friendly cabin crew and ground staff the departure time out of iceland is not the best but its understandable that they are given the worst timing slots as being the newcomer on the market
2975,air tahiti nui,3,air tahiti nui customer review,once on the plane it was great but ground team was horrible and inept we boarded at lax for cdg and were amazed at the lack of urgency or customer concern as the plane sat empty and the gate agent sat talking on her cell phone we all looked on amazed 45 minutes after we were scheduled to board she announced we would be boarding 15 minutes late due to the plane arriving late although it had been parked at the gate for hours as we waited clearly she had not looked at a clock this caused us to depart over an hour late unfortunately we were on this trip during the iceland volcano eruption air tahiti once again proved how little they cared i called the airlines 3 times about a flight only to be hung up on by the attendent once we had a flight we were told to be at the airport 4 hours ahead of time due to the challenge from the volcano we arrived 4 hours early but the agents did not we all 350 of us waited in line when they did show up it took them 45 minutes to get ready have coffee chat laugh joke and enjoy themselves all in front of us without any communication with us zero urgency or concern for all of us who had been waiting days to get on a plane once ticketed we went to the gate plane was there flight crew was there but not gate agents for hours we waited until they showed up and even longer while they organized themselves it was like a circus show watching them the whole ordeal was so ridiculous and unnecessary the ground team has no care or concern or urgency for the passenger i will never fly this airline again they didnt earn any stars with us
2338,air memphis,2,air memphis customer review,had booked for the wife and i to go to luxor for the day booked in advance through thomson holidays i thought it would be egyptair but getting onboard found out it was an air memphis md83 on entering the plane you could see how old it was old seats equipment etc it stank of aviation fuel at the back which is where we were sitting it was only a 30 minute flight to luxor but i was so glad that is all it was it was ok and they gave out little cartons of juice to take up the time
10305,georgian airways,3,strive mightily to avoid them,gatwick to tbilisi i purchases tickets in august for a november flight we were arriving from the us to gatwick and were to connect same day from gatwick to tbilisi georgian air decided sometime september october to change to a fall schedule which did not include a monday flight to tbilisi georgian air never emailed or called we learned approximately 3 weeks prior to our late november flight that we would be arriving in london on a monday but could not connect to tbilisi until wednesday georgian air never 1 attempted to place us on another carrier for same monday 2 offered a partial or full reimbursement for the flight or expenses or inconveniencenor 3 apologized at all georgian air placed me on the wed flight and said all is fine your flight is good for wed this cost me 2 hotel nights in london not cheap plus train tickets tofrom gatwick to hotel plus food for 2 days and we missed the business meeting that we were flying to anyway for a 5 hr flight they rattle around for the first 2 hrs then wake you more than an hour prior to landing for no apparent reason so dont plan on getting to sleep any significant amount the crew is friendly and seem very competent but the airline is apparently disorganized and has no idea how to compensate clients when they cost them unbudgeted funds i may have no options but this airline in the future but i will strive mightily to avoid them
8975,etihad airways,4,flight attendants outright rude,not worth the money paid business class service similar to that of a public tram flight attendants outright rude havent seen this attitude even in economy no bed linen or turndown service as different from emiratesturkish business class coffee machine not working for which i havent received even an apology air dhabi airport is a joke compared to dubai istanbul or singapore not fit for a decent layover business lounges packed with crying babies and dirty pampers literally every sit packed people playing videos and tiktoks on high volume staff chit chatting all flight with each other instead of serving customers not once has anyone asked whether everything was fine or i needed anything the chitchat was so loud i had trouble sleeping i had to ask the staff to keep it quiet a request that they completely ignored all for the 3500 ticket price as if this wasnt enough the epitome of the flight was at the end the business class toilet was occupied for a long time when the door opened a flight attendant came out i rushed in to brush my teeth and discovered a think air of electronic cigarette smoke you cannot confuse this smell with anything so apart from customer negligence poor service and low value for the money this airlines own employees are breaking the law and international flight regulations
18872,spicejet,1,i havent come across a worse service,i havent come across a worse service than the one offered by spicejet on 5th november 2022 i was travelling from delhi to udaipur on 5th nov for a vacation not only was the flight cancelled without informing us wasting hours at the airport booking new flight basis availability but they did not even have the decency to refund the amount that was spent booking the flights i am sick and tired of calling spicejet customer care but no one picks the calls i know many customers here are thinking that this might be a 1 of incident but trust me i have faced multiple issues with spicejet in the past and if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone reading this as well save yourself some trouble and book another airline for your own sake cant expect anything from from the airlines after this pathetic service
21190,turkish airlines,6,be prepared for screwups,check in fine but the tsa pre check did not show up even though i had provided all the info and confirmed that by phone lounge shared star alliance at lax tired dirty hot crowded did find outdoor space which was a relief was there about and hour and a half saw no one picking up dirty plates glasses napkins got to gate 15 mins before boarding was to start told to wait here and well make an announcement for boarding boarding started 35 mins after scheduled time no announcements eventually an employee said business line up over there and theres a long line of people who probably were given different info not a huge issue but the bad experience kept getting more irritating the plane fine well equipped very helpful and welcoming staff but theres poor info on the website about the seats seat map shows 2 seats an aisle and 2 seats seat map of tk website is not accurate its actually one seat an aisle two seats an aisle and one seat so we were a couple on a 13 hour flight separated by an aisle and the two seats were offset by approximately 15 inches so we couldnt even converse across the aisle not a fatal flaw but an example of sloppiness we took off an hour late with no explanation or a were sorry comment which would have been a nice touch so trying to balance it out with a real life experience im still answering yes id recommend it but be prepared for screwups and if you are two flying together take the middle two business class seats on this equipment
3828,alaska airlines,8,great customer assistance by the staff,smooth flight round trip and witnessed a lot of patience and great customer assistance by the staff one of the 6 american airlines i will fly with and i have flown on small and 4 seater planes and have followed airline travel for decades since i am a huge travel buff safety is number one then customer service then cost then on time departures
10973,hi fly,8,well trained and professional staff,amsterdam to new york i flew hi fly on a norwegian flight an older jet the interior was outdated a bit the overhead reading lights could only be turned on from the crew one of the bathroom sinks wasnt working there were only about 6 movies and 2 tv shows to be entertained from but if you are flying 8 hours you should know to bring some sort of entertainment with you seats were cloth not leather if that matters the crew more than made up for any shortcomings i felt like they had a full crew of well trained and professional staff but they were pleasant smiled and made sure our drinks were taken care of since we also bought meals they were likely one of the best crews that i have ever flown with i fly about 30 times per year all in all sure it wasnt a boeing 787 but they got us where we were going
4682,asky airlines,3,my bag was damaged,i flew to lome from johannesburg when l got my bag at arrival in lome the luggage wrapping was removed and my bag was damaged i reported to asky offices and they requested that i give them my empty luggage for investigating which i did they promised to give my feedback before i return as i was in lome for a week they never called back i had to buy another suitcase i have sent numbers of mails still no response except to acknowledge my query the staff on board was rude to me ne got so upset with me for asking her to give me a 2nd cup of tea

6957,china eastern airlines,6,tickets were extremely cheap,flew with china eastern from gatwick to bali via shanghai and back to heathrow flight from gatwick was poor compared to the flight back to heathrow on the return leg the food was good and flight attendants attentive however the flight from gatwick could be much improved we were served food within an hour of departure and then didnt see the flight attendants again until two hours before we landed an almost 8 hour absence no snacks no water 8 hours flight to bali on old a330 no entertainment and again limited fa presence however tickets were extremely cheap and so long as you stock up with water and snacks before the flight it is worth travelling with them for the cheap tickets
7030,china southern airlines,8,gave me the best service,this flight experience made me feel very good the staff of china southern airlines were very friendly and gave me the best service i will choose china southern airlines in the future

2239,air mauritius,6,i would recommend this airline,overall quite pleasant experience in business class seat 2a two hours late leaving heathrow due to a technical issue caused by the pushback truck no fault of air mauritius during that time the air steward and stewardess came around with more champagne and small a packet of snacks and kept us updated once airborne the service started promptly with delicious meals and attentive service from the air steward the catering out of heathrow is delicious and a lot better than coming from mauritius the catering from mauritius needs improving seat is quite spacious however i found it quite hard when sleeping british airways business class seats are more comfortable and have better padding i only managed to get a few hours sleep perhaps air mauritius should provide a mattresstopper like to put on top of the seat to provide more padding as they do in other airlines as part of their turndown service the air steward was very polite and addressed me by name no wifi was available on that particular aircraft the air steward said that it was the only airbus a350 of the fleet which didnt have wifi i would recommend this airline the cabin product could be better but the cabin staff makes up for it
22009,vistara,9,really help a lot to get it clear,i was coming from usa and having connecting flight to lucknow at the time of baggage checking the staff shakshi helped me a lot as there was one bag extra and i have already paid for that but somehow its was not showing in their website this girl really help a lot to get it clear
7015,china southern airlines,7,seat plane and amenities are super clean,despite 11 hr gzakl flight time the whole experience felt only 4 or 5 hours thanks to excellent sleep made possible by 180 degrees lieflat seat the seat strangely enough isnt comfy when its in recliner mode much better in normal seating mode with leg restlumbar support adjustments the message function is awesome however the seat design isnt really for storage of bagsshoes the spaciousness of the seat is more for writing and putting many dishesitems etc nevertheless space is plenty in overhead locker the cz business class experience isnt designed for people who want luxuriousspecial flight experiences its more for passengers who want good products great chinese food and things that just work the seat plane and amenities are super clean the punctuality is outstanding the service is more on the practical and taskcompleting sides than those of emiratessingaporeqatar airlines great attendance efforts and politeness despite not being fluent in english the crew are very hardworking and proactive in helping people its remarkable that it wasnt too long ago since china southern resumed its normal ways of operation to have abundant numbers of staff seven even for notbig business cabin is quite impressive
12242,jetblue airways,1,will never use this airline again,i originally booked a 9 am jet blue b6340 departure jacksonville fl that i would arrive in ny well ahead of the drive rush hour to ct some 39 miles away jb changed my flight to a 1230 flight that got me to ny at 245 middle of the rush hour 3 hour drive in heavy traffic to ct return flight june 7 flight 2339 flight delayed 3 12 hours as they used our aircraft for a fully booked flight to tampa our jacksonville flight was about 60 populated the cabin crew or dispatcher or whomever is responsible for catering the aircraft failed to notify the caterer of the new time gate etc whatever is needed for the caterer to know where to meet the aircraft many passengers were aware of the aircraft switch off and voiced their disapproval of this move i heard many folks like myself resolve to never fly jet blue again the crew did a very nice job of taking care of us however they could not offer hit coffee or tea as the plane was not catered jet blue offered us a 50 credit which is nonuse to me as i will never use this airline again this is the third time jb has botched my flights from or to ny where i travel on a monthly basis on one jb flight that was cancelled i booked a delta flight home from jfk after getting a cab from lga so i would not have to wait 36 hrs for a connecting flight thru boston to get home to jacksonville flying jet blue this cost me 559 no more jet blue they really do not manage the company as though they care about the passenger
16378,qantas airways,7,check in was easy and quick,i enjoyed the trip check in was easy and quick departure was on time and the staff were friendly and helpful the snacks offered could have been more substantial but i guess it wasnt too bad for a short flight
2489,air new zealand,6,seats very cramped,seats very cramped except for our original flight to auckland where we had bulkhead seats food and food service satisfactory but we had an outstanding cabin service director excellent with passengers and very good at his jobbest we have seen fight nz 6 from auckland to lax on june 5 2023
1870,air india,5,entertainment non existent,check in was smooth website works staff at counters were ok including those in seoul food average domestic connections were ok and food served was hot inflight announcements poor audio quality grammar and mistakes in announcement including time does not look professional cabin heads were both male and generally invisible safety only on screen only one out of pop down screens worked in one case my inflatable was on the ground onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wifes worked touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work headphones are not provided both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them they said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years food was bad and rice was undercooked no hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers staff good to average tokyo flight unresponsive and rude opposite on my seoul flight interiors worn out in both flights lumbar support lacking and worn out seats thin reminded me of cheap domestic flights
13330,lan airlines,7,lan airlines customer review,limscl economy overbooked flight some of us were left out no lan lounge at this airport using the airport one good options for snacks and drinks boarding by rows by they left us almost 20 min on the bridge waiting to board plane ok good legroon in economy nice fa and service on this 3hr flight to chile they serve a full meal and drinks movie on the overhead screens once in santiago bags short on belt
11995,jet airways,3,staff borderline rude,dubai to hong kong via mumbai cheap flight tickets but you understand why old aircraft no entertainment on flight screens dont work dodgy seats all this to arrive in mumbai to discover our flight was delayed 2h with no warning or compensation like a lounge access for example airport staff borderline rude and sleeping at the desk really showing their annoyance when you approach them flights delayed both on our way to and from hong kong cheap yes but at your own risk
17134,royal jordanian airlines,6,attendants are practically invisible,the boeing 787 is relatively new and the economy seats have great legroom the food quality is decent and the time between meals is not too long but dont board the flight super hungry as the food might not be enough inflight entertainment is decent and provides enough options to kill time on a long flight amman airport is modern and has so decent food options also the petra lounge is very nice and doesnt get very crowded if you have a tight connection they may hold the flight for you luggage made the connection amman airport is very poorly organized there is a serious lack of professionalism upon arrival there is an initial security screening for connecting passengers it looks as though this security station was shoved into a hallway without the architects knowledge the line is chaotic and nobody has thought to add ropes they also dont communicate what is going on so most passengers are unsure of where to go or what to do also passengers travelling to the us canada have to have their passports and visas checked before passing security but when i was there one of the two agents working this counter abruptly left leaving about 100 passengers with tight connections in a panic nobody communicated anything about what was going on for us canada flights there is yet another security station and here too nobody has thought about adding ropes to organize the line up note this is the third line you have to wait in when connecting despite having not appropriately resourced the airport to handle large volumes for some reason they schedule multiple us canada flights within 30 mins of each other so the 800 or so passengers totally overwhelm the airport facilities during high season the flight attendants are practically invisible when a meal is not being served they just lounge in the galley at the back you need to use the call button to get any service but they seem to resent you for disturbing them when you do so there are long periods of time up to 4 hours between meals where no drinks are served on most other long haul airlines the cabin crew will walk the aisles to pass around cups of water every few hours it took almost two hours to remove the meal trays from the seats they seem to keep the cabin quite war which makes the lack of water problem much more acute
11256,iberia express,6,doesnt offer a little snack,madrid to tenerife i was booked on this flight as connecting from venice and this was operated by iberia express i went to the counter as i wanted to change seat if possible as my friends had another seat assigned when i went to the counter there were two people sitting there one lady which was the first one i went to which asked me to wait as she was on her phone i was upset so i just went to the other hostess which was very kind and bit sarcastic and he helped me out with the tickets once at the gate my friends which were coming from another connecting flight had a big delay which was almost overlapping with our next flight to tenerife i was afraid that they would have missed their flight when i talked to the hostess she was looking like she was not caring when they started to understand what the issue was they tried to make sure that they could make it as it was just a little overlapping delay than luckily we made it to the flight and before taking off the flight attendant came to all the passengers to offer some water iberia doesnt offer a little snack which i could almost understand on a 45 minutes flight but that flight was 225h long the flight was basically a night flight so everything went smooth until we reached the destination
16435,qantas airways,4,really downgraded the quality,qantas have really downgraded the quality of their international economy class service particularly the food offering this flight had 2 meals dinner and breakfast both of which were very basic compared to previously just a small foil covered tray of hot food and a single additional sweet item no salads bread sauces fruit etc my flight immediately before this one was jal from paris to tokyo the superiority of the jal economy service and product compared to qantas was huge jal had more leg room far greater food offering and far more attentive staff qantas and jal are both premium priced airlines unfortunately qantas no longer is providing a premium offering at least in economy class
17582,sata air azores,2,lost its way in customer service,horta to london heathrow via lisbon a lack of customer care and support left us frustrated at lisbon technical issues with the horta to lisbon flight meant that we were just in time to board our scheduled connection to london our luggage was not it hadnt been deplaned from the horta flight we were given two choices board the connection now and the luggage might follow today or tomorrow and it was our responsibility to collect from london heathrow or wait for the next flight three hours later no choice then as no one wants to be separated from their luggage at heathrow i accept that flights can be delayed but the complete lack of ground support from sata for travelers with connecting flights even under code share is unforgiveable from other reviews it looks like a nice little airline has lost its way in customer service and support oh and dont get me started on the inflight catering possibly the driest sandwiches in recorded history
2679,air nostrum,5,air nostrum customer review,madtoumad on crj 900 the flight attendants provided a very good service even though the flight only lasted 50 minutes they did their very best on this time the only bad thing was the announcements the flight attendant who was in charge didnt spoke french maybe in flights that go to france they should speak a bit of french
18074,silkair,9,a worthy and solid performer,singapore to luang prabang return in april with a stopover in vientiane on the outgoing leg to laos second time on silkair this year and i was very pleased with the service to luang prabang checkin went without a hitch and boarding for the flight was quick as it was a low load on the singapore to vientiene sector i was served a total of six times on my flight to luang prabang by a very cheerful bunch of cabin attendants snacks drinks wine meals desserts etc the main meal of chicken pasta was alright but i wish they didnt skimp on the salad flight wasnt full so i had lots of room to stretch arrival in luang prabang was on time even with the slight delay in vientiane on the return flight it was a direct trip to singapore without a stopover this time round i think they were running short of wine as they only served this in a cup and didnt give out bottles the main meal was seafood pasta which was way better than the lunch i got once again they skimped on the salad inflight entertainment was quirky and the app crashed a lot good thing that i got newspapers on both legs of the journey all in all the cabin crew service was top notch and i really felt that they provided a great service this airline does have room for improvement but i can say that silkair is still quite a worthy and solid performer
11773,ita airways,7,i had a decent experience,i had a decent experience i was expecting the worst based on reviews since i had booked it before reading reviews they served us every couple of hours we were fed two meals and snacks in between i did get tired as it was a 14 hour flight so i stood in the back for sometime and nobody complained they had snacks and simple drinks in the back for you to self serve as well my baggage was not lost i had no problems with overweight issues and everything went smoothly in my opinion things could have been cleaner i will admit and a charging port would be great as well entertainment wasnt bad i watched two movies my only other complaint was no wifi offered
11673,israir airlines,4,israir airlines customer review,one way ticket from tel aviv to rome the aircraft is half empty israir really dont know how to sell those tickets i asked for vegetarian food and got a weird sandwich no expectations there overall it is a good airline service is good
9449,finnair,4,like a budget long haul flight,first flight was poor seat backs were like bricks no food no viewing screens 3 hr flight second flight had a problem so had to get off the plane and wait on another 1st plane seat was good but when seated back on new aircraft same seat number it turned out to be a seat with no seat in front good some would say for leg room but the tray table did not fold and as im a large guy could not get it down there was no headphone for the screen which seemed odd the original girl beside me had switched with her husband and he being a large guy as well made the flight awkward he was much larger than me the best is the food piece of chicken with cauliflower and spinach not nice at all with a tiny bread bun salad bowl thing which i passed on and a chocolate wafer bar poor offerings and not plentiful at all landing was only an hour late so no worries but before we landed at 530 pm we were given a small box contain 2 wet hash browns and a few mushrooms with an omelette on more spinach breakfast the seats were fine the staff were nice but i really think this was like a budget long haul flight and i will not be flying with them again until people start raving about how good they are one more thing dublin had 2 of the worst and slowest check in staff out of 3 appalling how they did not show any interest in being professional
22281,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,anrlcyanr friendly checkin staff and friendly flight attendants on both flights good sandwich free drink including a small belgian chocolate before the landing is a nice touch for such a short flight good seat pitch
21146,tunisair,4,tunisair customer review,tunfra on a 737600 very good experience although the flight time was relatively short tunisair served a hot meal and complimentary wine altogether much better service than for example german carriers offer on similar routes best of all the flight was considerably cheaper
12886,klm royal dutch airlines,6,experience with klm was good,flew kglamscph with klm 16 april 2023 on a330200 and b737 aircrafts economy lite ticket was quite cheap bought from an ota and easily handled online on klms homepage perks as flying blue gold card holder was given throughout from priority lounge selecting preferred seat etc checkin online did not work wasted time on several attempts however the checkin kgl was quick and hasslefree got option to select a better seat as the flight was full i chose an exit seat 30b which was a real winner and one of very few seats with gorgeous leg space such a seat costs 300 eur if prebooked but was offered to me during checkin free of charge likely due to my gold card this seat given to me in the last moment saved my trip as the original seating had changed the flight had become completely full and i about to be given a seat in a very crowded section near toilets access to klms 3rd party pearl lounge was granted due to my flying blue gold card the lounge is well supplied but of sparse offerings departure from kigali became 4 hours delayed however all delays were properly informed on monitors by email and by sms that caused me missing my flight in amsterdam but i did not stress just went to the klm lounge and printed out the revised bps for the last leg to cph which was scheduled ambiently enjoyed a solid nice breakfast in the impressive klm 52 lounge in nonschengen sector passport control and security check took more than an hour not acceptable the serious delay arose from a wheel puncture while the aircraft stopped over in zanzibar it was explained in detail by flight crew and from cockpit a new flight crew had just boarded in kigali they were fresh well groomed and well rested service was fine but food provided was very little though included a small hot airy pizza no alternative the wines offered were of rsa cape origin the red wine shiraz was good while the chenin blanc white wine was undrinkable they were served in well labelled minibottles which are a nice touch the cabin crew differed tremendously in attitude ranging from the typical surly patronising classic dutch crew to more modern and empathic types initially i was not recognised as status flyer but later they found out and provided me a full amenity kit and a dutch ceramic minihouse as souvenir disembarkation in schiphol was tedious by using busses from a remote stand last flight to cph was briefly on time and service onboard was fine luggage handled correctly throughout and arrived in cph timely despite having been rebooked and relabelled the experience with klm was good the serious delay from africa was well handled professional and faultless will fly again
441,aerolineas argentinas,8,a brandnew and very clean airplane,flew mendoza to aeroparque with aerolineas our flight left on time and on a brandnew and very clean airplane the flight attendants were friendly and the flight uneventful only nonalcoholic beverages are served for free which was ok given fair price we paid for the tickets i would recommend them
15785,peach aviation,9,peach aviation customer review,seoul to osaka round trip 214 and return 216 very popular route for koreans to take a weekend trip excellent price for such a short flight one hour and 45 minutes maximum we experienced a weather delay of one hour due to random snow at kix as we were on the last flight out of seoul we were scheduled to arrive at kix the minute the last bus was scheduled to depart for osaka i want to say that peach told the bus to wait for the plane we were the only ones in the peach terminal t2 when we arrived and there was still a bus waiting on us 20 minutes behind schedule the seats were a little tight and im 511 180cm but theyre nothing unusual for an lcc they offered snacks drinks and shopping onboard which a lot of people bought we just bought a water small mini evian bottle they take both currencies and cards which is convenient the flight attendants were friendly although very serious about bags under seats and phones turned off the only odd thing was that they didnt actually speak korean just japanese and english minimal prerecorded korean and the flights were about 96 korean 395 japanese and 005 foreigner i would gladly fly them again
20688,tigerair australia,2,carrier is of very poor quality,sydney to melbourne the staff were helpful but our 7am plane was cancelled at 1015pm the night before and rescheduled to 230pm the plane was further delayed for over an hour due to technical issues the seats were really uncomfortable and theres no room for anyone over 58 aside from the air hostesses the carrier is of very poor quality i would not use this service if you need to someone by a certain time there are many reviews that state the same issues
962,air austral,6,air austral customer review,noumea to sydney found air austral staff friendly and good customer service my only issue was the size of the seats in economy a tight fit
14403,malawian airlines,8,flight was surprisingly good,dar es salaam to lilongwe via blantyre both legs on a dash 8 q400 the seats still have the same colors as ethiopian and information is displayed both in english and amharic booking and online checkin both go through the website of ethiopian and are smooth as long as the standard android browser is not used baggage drop off at dar airport is also handeled well and staff is friendly turns out to be the crew of the flight the flight leaves dar at 745 in the morning and takes 2 hours to blantyre during which a hot breakfast is served my preordered vegetarian option included hashbrowns beans greens and a grilled tomato surprisingly tasty the aircraft is as noisy as a turboprop is but in a good condition and clean the crew is friendly and welcoming but i could feel that malawian is a small airline and not so experienced as ethiopian for example would be flight to blantyre was on time stopover quick 40 minutes onward passengers can stay in the aircraft and the short hop to lilongwe also on time putting the flight in a nutshell as malawian is a small airline with only 2 aircraft dash 8 and 737700 and only a handful of destinations in east africa the flight was surprisingly good and i would fly them again
923,air astana,1,highly recommend air astana,bangkok to almaty return first time flying with air astana and was incredibly impressed the service from ticketing check in to on board was exceptional travelling with a baby can often be tiring and stressful however they accommodated our needs every step of the way on return we had a quick transfer in bkk to another airline air astana staff were able check our luggage right through to the final destination tagged it to ensure ground crew knew of the urgency all went very smoothly and we made connections with zero fuss and our bags arrived first on carousel i highly recommend air astana and look forward to flying them again
22182,vivaaerobs,1,i am not at all impressed,as a travel agent i enjoy testing different airlines this is my first experience with viva aerobus and i have to say i am not at all impressed my flight houston to huatulco was changed by the airline to a flight it isnt even possible for me to make as i wont even land in houston until 3pm new flight at 10am after 3 customer service calls i ended up getting a voucher it wont be available to use for 3 days they could not rebook me houston monterrey huatulco even though there are flights available the usa customer service line does not work i had to call the mexico customer service line yes there is an english option they would not issue a refund even though this is a change they did they would only issue a voucher agent 2 said the voucher is good for a year agent 3 said the voucher is good for 120 days now i have to wait 3 days to use the voucher to do the houston to monterrey to huatulco
22010,vistara,8,service was excellent and consistent,ive flown this airline in same class before and knew what i can expect happy to notice that airline has hold its standard and imparts superior product among all indian and many eu carriers service excellence catering and safety are few important points i noticed where vistara really plays the ball well on both the sectors service was excellent and consistent as well as catering the entire cabin crew are eager at work and does all they could to serve the best polite courteous warmheart smartly dressed and professional crew reflecting indian culture the catering is among the best do not miss the desserts a catch i noticed is avod should be updated with new movies and series urgently the selection has to be more vivid broader and uptodate after one flight one can easily run out of options while onboard product is excellent where vistara can really improve is ground customer service now for the third time i got differing information in comparison to representatives on airport the ground staff is divided on procedures and info this can be make or break deal because its not reliable cabin crew should keep up the excellent work a superior product does cost a little more but vistara is doing its best and she does reflect her heritage inherited from elder sister in singapore
5981,breeze airways,2,not my preferred seating,paid for preferred seating and they placed us by the toilets and that was not my preferred seating when requested a refund the support chat was very rude and the inflight entertainment as advertised was never available on either flights

19169,sriwijaya air,6,price is quite affordable,i had a flight last week from yogyakarta to jakarta with sriwijaya air check in staff are very friendly i asked where the airplane coming from and she replied with a smile the flight was delayed about 10 or 15 minutes due the traffic congestion in yogya with an hour flight i got a tango snack and a cup of mineral water the seat was good and the airplane little bit hot at that time my main criticism is to their cabin crew which is not quite friendly enough one of the staff doing the safety demonstration did not have any smile or attract any attention from the passengers i think they should smile a lot during the flight overall the flight is good and the price is quite affordable
7172,citilink,6,rather a good experience,it was rather a good experience of flying with citilink from jakarta to makassar checkin went smoothly ground staff was very polite there was a bit of a mess with the departure gate as they changed it while the monitors were showing a different one nevertheless the plane took off on time and arrived on time service was ok no free food but what was available was pretty cheap anyway i can recommend this lowcost airline and will probably use their services again in the future
14747,mihin lanka,7,crew was quite active,kolkata to colombo average aircraft no ife available legroom is less but seat width is satisfactory crew was quite active throughout the 25 hour flight announcements were clear and audible restrooms were clean but only the rear restroom was allowed for the economy class passengers boarding was smooth food served was scanty but then it was a flight at 3 am so no one was really hungry
20947,tui airways,4,not impressed with tui,to be fair i dont know whether this is partly an airport fault we were booked on a flight due for take off at 250pm the airport board said check in opened 1220 we joined the queue at 1215 check in did not start until 1230 and then only one desk not two for another few minutes at the departure lounge the board said gate displayed 215 at 215 we went to gate 1 which we had been advised of by special assistance i have a problem with steps so required the lift to the plane when the flight was announced we were taken to the lift which has comfy seats fortunately we could see the other passengers queuing in the cold wind and gathering clouds at 230 the fueller was still operating the special assistance guy looked in the cabin through the window tried the emergency door but there was no response at first we could see the cockpit crew in the plane all i can assume is that cleaning took longer than usual given that the flight was supposed to take off at 250 the delay in boarding seems odd but then so does fuelling when the plane had been standing for about an hour and the airport was anything but busy eventually about 240 the cabin crew opened the door and we were allowed entry the plane was beautifully clean the cabin crew were smiley and friendly but how those poor people with toddlers and babies who had been standing in the cold were feeling i have no idea incidentally the stance tui uses is quite a walk from the terminal and only part of it is under cover given the inclement weather conditions in aberdeen generally its unfortunate to say the least ba has covered airbridges from the terminal for its flights maybe its a cost thing for tui the pilot announced something about possibly missing our slot worst case scenario half hour wait we either were allowed to go late or stole another flights slot but took off fairly quickly however both hubby and myself noticed excessive air pressure change on take off and landing of this flight its not something weve noticed before i cant say it was a different aircraft it looked like any other just not impressed with tui this time around it has always been my flight provider of choice but i maybe need to think again

9689,fly540com,8,fly540com customer review,nairobi to malindi and malindi to lamu both returns we found them to be quite efficient and helpful for an african airline they did however cancel our return flight from lamu but did send out a search party to find us on the island for us to catch an alternativeearlier flight timings were good with no delays in fact one flight left 40 mins early i would have no hesitation in recommending fly540 based on our experience aircraft a bit old but clean
7249,cityjet,7,cityjet customer review,flew luxlcy a very pleasant flight even if it was short the fokker 50 aircraft was lovely and although old and a bit falling apart was comfortable enough with plenty of legroom cabin crew were delightful and distributed a choice of croissant or pain au chocolate and water or orange juice half way through the flight which was nice captain gave announcements throughout the flight on the slightly old and crackly pa system the inflight magazine was dull check in was very easy however we were charged 60 euros for 2 check in bags as we had not payed for them in advance this is disappointing for a full service airline charging for luggage overall a great flight
6100,british airways,5,abysmal service,at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that needs vast improvement here
19791,tame lnea area del ecuador,3,would avoid if you can,cuenca to quito second flight cancelled in the space of a week after checking in at the airport first one resulted in a 3 hour delay after rerouting from guyaquil to cuenca via quito this one is an 8 hour delay leaving us no choice but to remain in cuenca airport just an 8dollar lunch voucher offered as compensation staff were friendly but information given was haphazard seats on other flights have been old and ragged food very poor would avoid if you can find another carrier
23023,xl airways france,3,the aircraft was dirty,paris to san francisco the aircraft was dirty thetable was broken on my girlfriends seat no inseat entertainment on long haul flights so be prepared to have a tablet or other form of screen support otherwise you can rent an ipad from the airline however make sure you ask for one as you sit down since they dont have enough for everyone the inbound flight was just as dirty this time no ipads to rent as none had been charged up from previous flight my seat was broken in the recline position and the armrests were broken

1604,air europa,2,avoid at all cost,we booked and paid online we arrive 2 hors before departure before being told we were on standby reason was a massive overbooking the plane was delayed by 130 hours we waited again to be told no one deemed overbooked will board we has to retrieve our luggage to start again the staff didnt understand the sky team highest status saying there was no business class on the flight try to explain the difference between a priority status and a seat class to a wall was easier avoid at all cost
6572,cathay dragon,9,very spacious and good ife,phuket to hong kong new terminal in phuket and it is much better than before spacious and airy i missed the earlier thai airways flight and they directed me to the cathay dragon counter the staff was sympathetic but asked me to buy a ticket online instead of directly from them as it would be cheaper and it was indeed of very good value check in was done quickly as i was very early for that flight the ground staff also told me not to go inside too early as the lounge they use was not up to the usual standard as the proper one wasnt open yet very honest and good advice as i found out later it was merely a cordoned off area the flight was full but boarding was orderly with priorities well respected smiley flight attendants greeted all passengers and the economy class seats were the same as their bigger brother cathay pacific very spacious and good ife once level off the crew immediately served a hot dinner it consisted of a ham potato and cheese salad too creamy and a chicken curry rice which was served pipping hot and very delicious they came round with ice cream and tea later the whole meal service took less than 40 minutes very efficient call bells were answered promptly and the flight attendants were kept very busy on this full flight landing was on time but parked at the far end of the terminal despite that it took 25 minutes from disembarkation to collect bags to boarding the airport express train
5980,breeze airways,1,not ever fly breeze again,we have not flown with breeze before but was the only option as this was the only direct flight to final destination with that being said we will not ever fly breeze again my husband booked a trip from cincinnati to california for a golf trip breeze looses my husbands golf clubs and leaves him on standby not giving him any additional information on where his luggageclubs are five days into the trip and he still does not have his clubs breeze then told him to drive to the nearest which was two hours away from where he was staying to pick up his clubs he arrives at said airport and they still do not have the clubs breeze told him the clubs were not on that flight they offered to refund him 45 when he was charged over 120 to ship the oversize luggage to his destination he was still charged 120 for the oversize luggage but still has not received it not only is my husband out the clubs but has no update on them and is having to rent clubs daily and bought new golf shoes to accommodate breeze airlines mess up for his trip this is the worst service weve ever received lack of empathy and communication does not help the situation
7671,croatia airlines,9,staff smart and friendly,gatwick to split check in was one of the fastest we have encountered desk opened early our flight to split was comfortable enough leg room plane clean one of the cleanest we have been on in economy 18 year old a320 staff smart and friendly small enjoyable snack given plus drinks all included in price plus benefit of reduction for being a seniorpensioner though downside you cannot book emergency exit seats for extra leg room however flight only couple of hours long so not necessary return flight again check in process prompt staff friendly enough but once snack served they stayed chatting at back of plane this was our first time flying with croatian but it will not be the last
17994,sichuan airlines,6,never being contacted,sydney to shenzhen via chongqing at an incredibly low price compared to qantas and cathay the business class checkin at sydney airport was fairly slow the skyteam lounge was basic no frequent flyer program available to accumulate miles into except their own i guess the cabin service with great crew business class seat was just an angled recline with no flat bed food was excellent but i tried the chinese menu only with special chilli sauce cannot judge on the english proficiency of the crew as i spoke mandarin chinese onboard after reading previous english speaking passengers reviews sichuan airlines cannot check the luggage through the final destination although within the same airline nor ground transport existed in chongqing airport at 4ish in the morning therefore i had to drag my bags from intl terminal to domestic for probably 500m on a 4lane airport highway against the traffic with no pedestrian path existed where the sichuan airline counters is located at the furthest end of the domestic terminal lucky there was not much traffic at 430am on another note we had to wait on board upon landing before being allowed to leave the aircraft because the custom officers had not started working encountered problems with domestic security check as my booking on their system showed internet booking instead of a chinese id card number trouble started when there was a thunderstorm in shenzhen with 200 flighted cancelled or delayed no notification from airline by phone or email they could not move me to an earlier flight on the same day that was still operating by sichuan airlines from shenzhen to chongqing only option offered was 3 days later with the same route back to sydney i therefore had to ferry to hong kong to catch a singapore airlines flight back to sydney on the same day i understand the airport chaos was beyond control of the airline due to bad weather but the weather condition in hong kong was absolutely the same as it is a just neighbouring city a few miles away sichuan airlines did offer me 50 refund for involuntary cancellation of the return journey the refund however has not come back for 2 months for now i chased them 3 times over the phone to china but was told each time theyd escalate and asked me to leave contact details never being contacted they did not have any record of my contact details or previous conversations i insisted to speak to the duty manager yesterday when i called and demanded for a follow up this apparently has worked and an email soon followed on the second day advising pig your refund has been approved check your bank account in a week to confirm i dont think i will deal with sichuan airlines again
7902,cubana airlines,4,cubana airlines customer review,flight from gatwick to holguin was smooth and i was impressed with the food and legroom on the plane however our next flight with them was a different story we were flying to havana at the crack of dawn and were informed there would be a stop off after only 15 minutes in the air we arrived at another airport and had to disembark before we took off for havana if i thought that flight was bad i was in for a shock regarding the last flight home 4 hours before we were due to leave to the airport we were told our flight was going to be delayed 11 hours returning to our hotel room we were told that it was delayed yet again but didnt have any idea for how long waited overnight to find out that another 18 hours delay was expected when we finally got the airport there was a further 4 hour delay so altogether a 33 hour delay which resulted in us missing our connecting flight back to scotland and an overnight stay in gatwick flight home also consisted of ham and cheese twice and no inflight entertainment and filthy toilets will never fly them again

21563,uzbekistan airways,4,a horrible experience,london to amritsar via tashkent it was a horrible experience with uzbekistan airways the in flight attendants were inexperienced they burned my arm and leg in departure and arrival flights with hot coffee the staff even didnt knew how to serve coffee in flight then the worse part was that they didnt even offer first aid the food quality inflight entertainment broken seats is not worth mentioning
19913,thai airasia,3,space between rows is small,first time seeing that if you purchase two tickets at the same time you get two different spots not next to each other have no idea why i should be separated with my wife on flights the space between rows is small seats are awful it was my most horrible flight

11261,iberia express,4,unpleasant and unfriendly staff,madrid to santa cruz de la palma with iberia express too small space for legs if you are over 180 cm quite unpleasant and unfriendly staff like most iberia staff with very limited knowledge of english
12687,kam air,3,kam air customer review,the flight attendants try to do their jobs with a smile food is not bad and while it is perhaps faint praise i have never gotten ill from the food after perhaps 20 flights from dxb to kbl and vice versa the seats are comfortable in business only once has my luggage been left behind and in that case the next day i received a call from kam that my bags had arrived kam is now running a second flight to eliminate the one downside of its dxbkbl flight and that was the 0700 or 0800 departure time now they have a terminal one flight from dxb leaving at 1300 planes need to be newer if possible but they are clean and get the job done
16114,play,3,horrible inflight experience,just horrible inflight experience and not even that cheap by the time youre done paying for bags and seats im not sure its any cheaper particularly when you consider how much longer it is to fly through iceland the planes are so basic genuinely had better amenities on a greyhound bus 6 hour flight without even a free glass of water no power outlets no in flight entertainment of any type boarding is a hot mess all 4 times its unclear where priority lines are or who should be boarding and when and then everyone just boards all at once with people at the bag putting their bags at the front which screws up the deplaning very poorly organized only positive thing i can say is all the flights were on time
20931,trigana air,8,aircraft was clean and cool,jayapura to tanahmerah flight left and arrived on time aircraft was clean and cool crew friendly and even a simple inflight meal of a box of tea and a cake was provided
9893,flyone,1,late checkin is 30 euros per person,cheap and certainly not cheerful this airline is the worst airline i have ever flown if you are not extremely early in arriving at the checkin desk they refuse to provide you with your ticket unless you take a trip across the airport to a tax office and pay a fee of 30 euros they claim that this is a fee for late checkin the office where i had to pay the fee does not accept card payments i therefore had to travel again to another side of the airport to an atm wasting more time all in all it took me half and hour to sort this and i only made the flight because it was delayed also when paying the fee in turkish lira they then upthe price even further without telling us beforehand so we paid more in turkish lira than we would have paid in euros despite this being turkey the price for late checkin is 30 euros per person i thought it was suspicious when i was booking my ticket online and they automatically add pointless extras for an extra cost without you having asked for them so you have to navigate back through the booking form to uncheck all of the boxes
17914,shanghai airlines,5,shanghai airlines customer review,shanghai pudongincheon gimposhanghai hongqiao flights delayed for 1hr for both 2 legs very cheap fares compare with ozke you pay what you get foods very normal service terrible shanghai airlines is more like a budget airline
5057,avianca,5,catering is shameful,los angeles to bogot business class seats great catering is shameful tiny portion of food and water no coffee on a colombian airline crew sat at front and chatted for hours bathrooms uncleaned we got there and back largely on time but really the catering manager should be ashamed online side of operation is glitchy and tricky seatbelt signs kept on for no apparent reason
8467,egyptair,1,offered a nonvegetarian meal,on flight from cairo to mumbai we were offered beef in our meal despite we opted vegetarian meal option on top of all the behavior of crew members was extremely rude and arrogant it was complete chaos before we were served the meal we were observing that the hostess was not serving passengers as per their preferred meal selection rather she was simply asking for the meal passenger of the passengers a vegetarian meal or a nonvegetarian meal whereas people like us who dont eat any nonvegetarian food were offered a nonvegetarian meal
2172,air malta,1,no help whatsoever,our terrible time with air malta started with baggage checkin we bought our tickets through expedia and they just said economy turns out air malta has like 5 different ticket types and the one we had didnt have checked baggage we didnt know this in advance but whatever we payed to checkin our luggage we were traveling as a group of 3 and my friend was in a wheelchair because her leg was broken she has been in a full cast up to her knee for over a month on our way to malta from israel on flight air malta 829 that departed sunday morning apr 14 2019 at 7 am my friend was questioned about her cast how long shes had it and if shes cleared to fly we answered all of their questions told them the cast was a month old and that the doctors cleared her to fly in the end of this questioning we were all allowed to board and the israeli ground stewardess even found my friend a row of seats so that she could elevate her leg comfortably on our way back from malta to israel on flight air malta 828 that departed friday morning apr 18 2019 at 1 am my friend was giving the same round of questions except that this time they declared she was unfit to fly and that their doctor said it would be very dangerous for my friend to fly with a full cast it did not help that we told them we flew with there airline 5 days ago and that she was fine they said that this was a mistake and she should never have been let on the first flight to begin with or that we had papers in hebrew proving my friends cast was at least several weeks old nothing helped they told us she had to go to a clinic in malta to get her cast cut so that it was a half and not full cast and that we were wasting our time my 2 traveling companions got in a cab and went to go get the cast cut in a foreign country where we knew nothing of the healthcare system this would have been fine but the clinic they sent us do didnt have the equipment to cut the cast so that trip was a waste when we asked what we could do if their own recommendation didnt pan out and they said that my friend would have to stay to get her cast cut at the hospital we tried to find out from the maltese air malta manager if there would be any kind of compensation since they would not let my fried on the plane could they transfer her ticket book her a hotel for her extra overnight stay we were given a negative response on both counts and she told us that it was stated clearly in the air malta rules that you cannot fly with a full cast we searched for a while for these alleged rules and couldnt find them only general airline guidelines that said you shouldnt fly within a few days of getting a cast so this was our problem when we tried to find out what else we could do and if we could maybe get the hospital that treated my friend to send an email in english that cleared her to fly the manager speaking to us was very rude said she was repeating herself and just walked away since the 3rd traveling companion and i could not afford to wait any longer or buy new tickets we left my friend in a cast with her wheelchair and crutches to stay alone overnight and try and book another flight air malta was obviously no help whatsoever in the end my friend got a doctors letter in english saying she was cleared to fly and booked herself a flight back to israel through another airline company with a layover in vienna so this was not the most convenient flight
7546,copa airlines,2,my recommendation is to use another airline,i am gold member for more almost 10 years with copa there is absolutely no difference between elite status and economy in this airline there is not even a preferential line for boarding the vip lounge has only coke and chips and unfortunately the service of the staff is bad all around my recommendation if the choice is available is to use another airline american airlines for the same route for instance is excellent and cheaper
3337,airasia philippines,1,thus far refused to refund,airasia philippines has thus far refused to refund the sum of a cancelled flight back to my bank account even though it promised to do so out of all airlines i have used this one seems to be the worst there are no words for the lack of service i have received after putting so much trust in them
4330,american eagle,6,service was adequate,the service was adequate food beef salad was adequate equipment old and tired cabin crew friendly however there appears to be something jinxed about this flight second time in 18 months we have flown this route and both times significant delays this time it was 90 minutes the frustrating aspect was the number of gate changes six of them three of them in the last 60 minutes before departure the same number as the last time
19418,surinam airways,3,surinam airways customer review,i have traveled surinam airways 3 times and none of those times we departed on time the service on board is good though and they serve a hot meal at least i fly most of the time from aruba to miami but instead of leaving at 11 am we departed 8pm the other day supposed to leave miami around 330 pm instead we left around 1 am we spent 13 hours at miami international they provided us with a 10 voucher for food unacceptable
23046,xl airways france,5,xl airways france customer review,this was the least expensive flight i saw advertised and was not as bad as some reviews had made me fear the legroom is scarce for a taller person i am 5 foot 9 and it seemed that this flight was slightly longer than it actually was the food was average but given the price i cannot say i wont fly this airline again
9558,firefly,3,firefly customer review,kuala lumpur to pekanbaru indonesia about a onehour flight our plane was scheduled to depart at noon but we arrived to find that the flight had been delayed until 230 as one of their airplanes had technical problems and was removed from their fleet of 5 planes although we had supplied contact information and they acknowledged that they should have called us to let us know about the delay we received no information when we did board the flight was nervewracking due to turbulence most of the way
18379,sky express airlines,3,it is unacceptable that sports equipment has limitations,as a low cost airline it is good but it is unacceptable that sports equipment has limitations for a snowboard equipment the board should be only 110 meters the average height of the board is 140150 can someone explain this logic to me especially when they have flights to winter locations and you want to go and do winter sports
2605,air niugini,3,seat pitch is ridiculously tight,sydney to port moresby air niugini use a remote hard stand for boarding in sydney passengers can expect to catch a bus to take them to the aeroplane economy class seat 12b the seat pitch on the boeing 737700 is ridiculously tight and is much much less than their 767s which i fly very often i use qantas 737800s every 12 weeks and they offer a much better seat pitch i am 189cm and my knees were jammed against the seat in front on the air niugini 737700 the seat cushioning and lumbar support is near nonexistent and passengers should expect to have back and leg pain on arrival the 767 is the same the seats fail to lock up right and recline on takeoff my seat gradually reclined to the full reclined position on its on which severely impacts the limited space for the person seated behind you the ife on their boeing fleet 767 and 737 has issues the touchscreens rarely work and register phantom touches consistently throughout the flight these either sequence the exit movie button or turn the volume to max the passenger in the seat next to me screens orientation was upside down the food is relatively good for an economy flight general condition of the aeroplanes are showing their age
8857,ethiopian airlines,5,the staff were mostly distant during the flight,this review only covers bkk to add business class was less than half full not a high work load for the staff flight went sour for me 20 minutes into the flight the purser yelled at me for no reason i was stunned claiming i jumped the queue to the bathroom there was no queue this has never happened to me beats me what she was thinking poor behaviour from a purser the staff were mostly distant during the flight not just to me but some were very friendly and nice food was nothing fantastic beef was tough during the entire flight the purser looked sour luckily she was mostly working in eco at arrival in addis chaos as eco passengers stormed forward and i missed the business class bus and my wheelchair assistance
14449,malaysia airlines,2,this airline is incredibly poor,this airline is incredibly poor first the flight was delayed three times while already on the plane due to technical issues they claimed to have it fixed three times and three times it failed after spending three hours on the plane and not moving plus dealing with the heat as they wouldnt turn the airconditioning on we were offered the smallest bag of peanuts as compensation i can accept a poor flight however we missed our connecting flight and were put on the next available flight at 330 in the morning ruining our planned transport and accommodation we were given no compensation but the thing that has tipped me over the edge is we decided to buy extra legroom for our return flight after being hung up on we where finally able to book and pay for this then 36 hours later we were charged again for the same amount i have really struggled in dealing with this airline and then to find out that they have held my card details for over 24 hours and felt it acceptable to change us with out consent is disgusting i promise this will be the last time i fly with this airline
18692,south african airways,9,best crew ive had to date,livingstone to johannesburg my 40th flight on saa in the last 15 months or so and i must say this was the best crew ive had to date flawless service engaging purser the captain even made his announcement in german as there were germans on board saa has challenges but once up in the air their service is consistently good and a positive attitude from all the crew
3563,airbaltic,3,more attention to ground service,brussels to riga planes are mainly comfortable and crew onboard is nice and friendly food and beverages what you can buy onboard is also good flying is good and comfortable but checkin and boarding are below average i have been flying all over the world the last 10 years so i share my last experience with air baltic my flight from brussels to riga should depart 955 reallife we depart 1015 not so big deal we arrived on time i was 0730 in the airport to do checkin after my arrive checkin just opened before me was 9 persons to checkin then i was next in line and checkin lady was replaced the new lady lost her id card so she was unable to do any checkins so lady before and the new lady walked away and they only say somebody will be here so finally checkin was done they check in 10 persons with one hour then i go shopping and then boarding was announced and everyone told to be quick so we can depart on time never heard that kind of announcements before may by air baltic you change your boarding system it is unacceptable to say that kind off announcement in my opinion i have used air baltic before 4 times and every single time i had some issues in checkin it looks like that their checkin and ground service is really below average so also we wait for 1 hrs for our checkin luggage at riga airport so if you are ready to deal all that crap before the flight for lowcost flights i recommend air baltic i rate planes and comfort on flight 4 but ground service 1 so the total score is 2 if they but more attention to ground service i think they will be a much better airline air baltic first opinion is most important i hope that in future if i use your service again i get a better experience
10809,hainan airlines,9,i had a satisfied flight,chongqing to new york when i booked the flight it was the new reverse herringbone business class configuration but unfortunately the aircraft was changed in the last day to a 222 configuration which i didnt like it much the aircraft was full the crew maintained a very high level of service its the longest route of hainan after the dinner service and few hours of sleeping everyone woke up and started to ask for dining there were few seats in business class had problems with the usb charger another few in economy had problems with the entertainment system cabin crew explained and tried to make it up to those passengers i had a satisfied flight in the end really appreciate the effort of all flight attendants onboard
8677,emirates,9,a great experience,excellent service i flew dubai bham dubai in economy class emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage initially i was skeptical particularly on the dxbbhx route but emirates made no mistakes this is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge the flight departed on time the crew had a smile and were quite professional food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class there was another snack service followed by juiceshot drinks 15 hours before landing the seating is quite good and has a seat pitch of 32 b777s in use by emirates are getting old and you can see the signs their ice system was excellent i am not sure i would like the business class seats here as they werent lieflat but i was flying economy families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using polaroid cameras the inflight wifi was free for text messaging using whatsapp even in economy if you have skywards membership my only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at terminal 3 in dubai to reach immigration which was a breeze overall it was a great experience but flights are quite expensive compared to the competition
16075,phuket air,5,phuket air customer review,gatwick bangkok returncheck in boarding at gatwick was a breeze no one waiting for either on entering the 747300 all the way to the rear each cabin crew member gives the traditional thai greeting a bit late leaving due to a few missing passengers these prehistoric aircraft are not comfortable when stationary there is no individual air con no air moves around the cabin until the aircraft is in flight quite a few of the pax were fanning themselves with the inflight leaflet hot cloth towels were offered but were strangely dry drinkspeanuts dinner of green chicken curry or salmon fillet with rice a chickpea salad strawberry tart plenty of offers of wine teacoffee flight both ways were not full so had a 3 seat row going the last econ middle row on return legroom varies on the way i had about 32 pitch entertainment is via overhead screens drinks available throughout the flight all service calls answered straight away the crew very friendly taking time to talk to pax to answer any questions coming back check in at bkk a nightmare 4 desks open 60 full flight but still took over an hour took off straight into a very bad thunderstorm the plane rattled rolled dipped upped went all over the place for about an hour the crew sitting either side of me looked very nervous once everything was stable the same good service slept most of the way back the plane refuels in dxb but no major hassles front rear door open so air moves through cabin no problem if pax wish to stand by doors again crew happy to chat one was even helping a pax with stretching exercises more drinks sandwiches after takeoff breakfast before landing at lgw luggage took usual time for to come through not a bad airline staff great but some of their inexperience shows they need to upgrade the aircraft
18685,south african airways,2,shall not recommend saa,johannesburg to lodon we booked the flight and also made advanced seat selection seats 55h and 55 k more leg space on 3d of august reason is that i am 190 m long on the flight sa 234 on friday the 11th from johannesburg the airline has changed the type of airplane they did not inform us before by email whattapp on there own saapp and also not at the counterdesk where we put our luggage therefore we paid for nothing and other people were sitting the staff of sa in the plain didnt do anything to help us and only said you can get your extra seat costs back at the counter in londonwe didnt have a chance to upgrade or change our seats we could not go to the counter because we had a connecting flight 1 hour later to schiphol amsterdamit was very disappointed i have sent an email to sa customer services directly but did not receive any reply till now on top of that a staffmember suddenly came in the plane with a insectide in aerosol and sprayed us all it was a disaster total no feeling to the client i shall not recommend saa to anybody

13198,kuwait airways,3,missed the connecting flight,flight departed 1 hour late from the original starting point hence the 1 hour layover at kuwait was missed and hence i missed the connecting flight from kuwait initially the staff didnt take any responsibility and only offered the same flight the next day and hotel accommodation but i had to reach cok urgently after 3 hours of struggle talks and debates a manager turned up and people who didnt have to travel urgently were sent to a hotel and the rest of us were booked onto an alternative airline oman in my case via muscat which would get me to my destination 9 hours later than my original itenary had no choice
6435,caribbean airlines,3,cabin was tired and dirty,this should have been one review as i purchased a ticket from georgetown through to toronto however on arrival in trinidad we were told we would have to deplane and change aircraft in any other airport it would be simple not in trinidad zero ground staff and we waited in a queue for 30 minutes and only after i asked were we advised that the boarding pass printer was down finally had to issue new boarding passes why then go through security again and head to the gate i had found out my seat was changed to a window from an aisle and trinidad gate agent said no other aisles available but on boarding i saw the emergency exit was free he lied flight left 20 minutes late and captain said it was a mechanical issue but a pax boarded at departure so was it mechanical seat cushion was nonexistent and cabin was tired and dirty also greeted in y by a nasty flight attendant who started to harangue me for putting duty free in the overhead bin as it could fall out a simple move of the bags already there fixed that potential issue flight attendant watched and scowled as i sorted out the bags and solved her stacking issue so much better to give crap to customers than fix the problem 75 minutes after take off lunch arrives i have never seen anything so gross in my life just serve nothing if this is the best you can do no pre meal beverage service only done at the same time as the so called meal after meal waited over an hour for pick up of the tray and no after dinner beverages offered this was a nearly 6 hour flight no service for 2 hours and no warning that feature movie was going to start of course no request to lower blinds so couldnt see tiny overhead screens anyway they say free entertainment but no headsets provided bar service 90 minutes from toronto and later the ridiculous and old fashioned warning to turn off phones and ipads as landing soon hello it doesnt matter on us or canadian aircraft why on caribbean airlines to top it off took 60 minutes for bags to arrive in toronto i love caribbean airlines ad campaign in georgetown with slogan demand value really as a customer how about demanding a smile or two maybe crew was so miserable as they were missing carnival
8177,druk air,6,druk air customer review,druk air the flag carrier and only carrier to bhutans only commercial airport paro is up to snuff the 141 jets are dualconfigured and it is worth flying c class as i did from delhi via kathmandu and again from paro to calcutta if only to have better maneuvering for the quite incredible flightseeing of the himalayas the fas are friendly professional the food service is adequate if bland reflecting the cooking of bhutan perhaps the check in facilities are excellent and paros terminal building is quite pretty almost folksy in a way i look forward to flying druk again the name means dragon in bhutanese for otherwise why would anyone choose such an unappealing sounding word at least to an english speakers ear druk does not cooperate in ticketing with iata carriers and ticket costs are somewhat stiff i doubt if the king of bhutan will permit competition anytime soon
12263,jetblue airways,7,incredible customer service,i arrived at airport 15 hours early and did not make flight because of slow workers at airport i made it to the boarding door 60 seconds yes 60 seconds late and they would not let me board man was completely rude again 60 seconds late because of airport workers they gave me another flight almost 4 hours later causing me to miss an important meeting they also did not assign me a seat and instructed me to go to new gate and speak with attendant there she was fantastic explained everything in detail and was super nice with incredible customer service skills she bought me back to jet blue incredible person and deserves many prompts i actually bought her a gift card for her caring and respect of my situation
15589,onur air,7,onur air customer review,manchester to ercan via dalaman paid for extra legroom at man and these seats were good as they did have a lot of extra space flight left on time and checkin was good however there was a problem with the cabin crew in that they did not speak very good english and their announcements were very difficult to understand given that most of the people on board were english their lack of their ability to speak our language was very bad meal we were supplied with was alright and we were given plenty of drinks stopover in dalaman was a bit tedious and no one came near us when the crew changed over not offered any refreshments on the flight over return flight was ok but the reception at ercan airport was disgusting we were waiting in a queue at 330 in the morning and the ground staff were just laughing at us all standing waiting to be processed on the whole the flights were ok and the service on board but their lack of speaking english was i feel disrespectful however the flights were on time but long particularly having to wait for approx 45 minutes in dalaman before travelling onwards to ercan
17157,rwandair,8,hardly worth the extra costs,flew kgldoh 12th june 2023 on an award ticket from qatar airways the boeing 737800 aircraft was aged but clean and well maintained night departure departed on time luggage labelled and transferred correctly earlier i complained to rwandair that they had deprived lounge access to qr their partner gold card holders they responded swiftly in kigali and statusmatched me to gold on their own dream miles program enabling me to use their lounges eg in kigali their dream lounge in kigali is quite good though far from world class seat choice limited at booking but at checkin everything was possible was assigned seat in row 5 just after business class later i negotiated with the cabin crew to grant me one of their two occupied sections 3 seats in a row though next to toilets in the very rear generously they agreed upon some internal discussion as they would now have to squeeze while i could stretch out the crew were all great apart from the arrogant chief purser i had preordered seafood and was given a large delicious portion of two salmon steaks my name and a few details were handwritten on a sticker placed on the cover foil this sfml option is available on many african airlines which supersedes most other carriers drink rounds were frequent and wines were of fair quality ife was useless as monitors are few and shared thus no option apart from watching an american teenage movie seats are spacious and footrests helps pillows blankets headsets given to all recommended despite tickets are pricey on this sector business class seats are spacious but just recliners hardly worth the extra costs compared to economy
9461,finnair,1,worst airline service,vberlin to delhi via helsinki 10 hours before 9pm my journey i test positive for covid 19 so like any reasonable human being i contact all my close contacts about the same since finnair customer care is anyway not open post 8pm in germany the next day i contacted finnair about my situation and that i have missed my flight due to covid requesting a reschedule of my onward journey the quote they propose for the new onward journey seemed a bit high as there were better options that flew directly to my desired destination thus i suggested them to just keep my return journey from delhi to berlin they do not reply to my email for a day and the next day informed me that since i missed my onward journey now my return journey is also cancelled a journey which i had paid to upgrade from economy to business the customer service is extremely rude and has no sense of empathy the entire airline operates without a sense of caring about their guests and is just looking to scam the customer in its operating methods i would highly suggest anyone to not fly this airline you will be better off with the middle eastern carriers always because they always at least care about their guests the customer service at finnair is coldhearted with no empathy towards their guests health if you book your ticket from an agent then this is probably the worst airline service that i have encountered to date as they simply tend to pass the buck on the agent a behaviour that i have never seen with other flag carriers like af sq ey or qt
12860,klm royal dutch airlines,9,staff are friendly and this flight no exception,im a big klm fan so my review is slightly biased im probably unusual in that i actually enjoy an 11 hour flight with themeven if squashed into economy this was a full flight 425 passengers all expecting to be fed watered and presumably pampered down at the other end of the plane the crew dealt with the vast numbers of people well klm staff are generally pretty friendly and this flight was no exception one massive plus point ive noticed with klm over the years is they match your formality level im quite relaxed and the crew match that by calling me by my first name etc food was adequate for such a long flight there was a main meal not long after take off followed by a midflight snack and a sandwich just before landing the beverage trolley was wheeled out a few times usual tiny airline food portions however but was quite tastyaside from a horrible coconut type dessert thing klm give bottled water instead of those weird plastic pots with the foil lid that guarantee you will drench the passenger sat on your lap in economy this is good ife with klm is always slightly disappointing yes theres a lot to choose from but the vast majority is american rubbish why the fixation with us content youre a dutch airline show some european solidarity i cant be the only one who doesnt want americans screaming at me for an 11 hour flightif i did id fly delta
5341,bangkok airways,5,wait at the airport for 4 hours,mandalay to chiang mai i am now at mandalay airport waiting for my flight which is supposed to take off at 1800 local time the fact is that i could only learn about my flight delay when i arrive at the airport now i will have to wait at the airport for 4 hours instead of two plus i can find no one to talk to about this issue because the counters will be open according to the new time of the flight i wonder how i will be compensated now it would be nice at least to have a meal ticket to use at the airport my flight from chiang mai was also delayed but then i was sent an email
16017,philippine airlines,4,overall were ok nothing special,pricewise this is the cheapest airline on this route but a 6 hour longer detour flights overall were ok nothing special food and service on both flights so so very limited choice and not very tasty staff not very attentive however on this point i must say that wearing these facemasks does not contribute all by all nothing special and in our view an airline at the lower end of the spectrum pretty good seat and plenty of leg room on the a321 in the a330 the inflatable cushion of the seat was not working and one of us had to sit on the metal frame maintenance staff could not solve the issue cabin staff finally offered a pillow not very comfortable on a night flight lying flat lie flat seat it was pretty ok the transfer on naia was an absolute disaster it had a major impact on the overall experience hence our overall view on pal we had 3 hours to transfer and it took us 2 hour ground staff is keeping themselves busy with inexplicable activities leaving a queue of hundreds of passengers who had to crawl through a very small space in the dark first one had to obtain a small stamp on the boarding pass for what reason unclear nothing was additionally checked after that the cabin luggage had to be scanned again was already scanned in sin suitcases had to be picked out and opened for another check drugs with a cotton wool pad but without putting it in an analyser afterwards the suitcases were loaded finally at the gate the cabin luggage was scanned again the experience on naia was absolutely stressful to put it mild the final question is would we fly pal again first reaction no not likely
10932,hawaiian airlines,1,providing well below average service,thank you very much for providing me with a horrible service and ruining my honeymoon i used hawaiian airlines for interisland transfers and they were never on time always late i had a day trip to maui and they started loading cargos after all passengers had completed boarding thankfully it only took about 20 minutes or so on 072322 there was an issue on a plane and all passengers had to deplane and take another flight i planned a day trip to kauai departing honolulu at 7am and coming back at 6 pm however because of the delay now i have to cancel all booked activities the airplane is still not departing as of 72322 840 am one good thing about hawaiian airlines is they are very consistent they are very consistent in providing well below average service they dont let you down when providing poor services they are never sorry for anything i have another upcoming island excursion to the big island i hope not to get the same consistent service
4629,asiana airlines,9,great experience from start to finish,great experience from start to finish checkin agent very polite and efficient priority given for security checks they use the air new zealand lounge great one with lots of food and beverage choices great seating spaces boarding a bit late due to weather conditions at syd airport once on board the a380 feels spacious and very comfy fas are great they give a superb infligth experience the only thing that needs to be improved is the ife not a big selection of movies food and wine selection great for business class the korean meal experience if you choose to try it is really good seat comfy and lots of space around overall a great experience and got in a taxi short 30 mins after arrival
3393,airasia philippines,4,staff were crass and unrefined,cebu to manila with airasia the positive thing is that they are very affordable especially when you book a week before and all the flights have become quite pricey the downside is that more often than not you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service as i was boarding back to manila the gate staff were extremely rude and unpleasant they tore my boarding pass carelessly without a bit of finesse when i passed they abruptly went after me and rudely said that they had to weigh my bag they weighed it and it exceeded 1 kilo more than the allotted 7kg i brought the same things i did when i came to cebu last week so i was surprised but they demanded i pay luckily i have someone with me whos carrying less than 4 kg worth so they got my excess 1kg but the staff were extremely angry and unpleasant it made my flight tense and uncomfortable the plane was half empty by the way staff were so crass and unrefined for the hospitality business i understand that for a lowfare airline we get what we pay for but i dont think it should come with cheap staff and cheaper service truthfully airasia is a big help to a lot of people and travellers but would it hurt to treat them with respect
1416,air china,9,in flight service efficient,london to phnom penh via beijing not the newest of aircraft but plenty of space due to old style 333 seating rather than 343 favoured by many airlines acceptable food better than ba but not to emirates or qatar standard in flight service efficient and staff on both flight were keen to help and engage with passengers i was particularly impressed with the purser and crew on our second flight who handled the cabin very well and professionally during turbulence and showed care when dealing with passengers i would put air china somewhere above the volume us airlines who tend to serve food in boxes around ba but below the middle east airlines for the price point circa 450 round trip they are very good
2090,air macau,5,air macau customer review,icnmfm on old a321 seats are old styled and very tight service is outstanding but meals are poor no various beverages for their serving as well captain spoke english very well a321200 is too narrow between seats and aisle however quite ok for me for my next trip if the price is right then i may use this flight again
20237,thai smile airways,7,exorbitant cost of baggage,the service and capability of thai air is always very well done and pleasant the crew is always affable my issue is the exorbitant cost of baggage over 20kg as they now charge 180bahtper kilo it had been 90bahtkg i also question the accuracy of their scales it certainly made my flight much more expensive than originally anticipated in fairness i will note that the luggage checkin attendant did give me a small break on the overage price
5784,blue panorama airlines,4,cabin crew friendly and professional,mxphav return in y class boeing 763er was in good condition and quite confortable i chose for poltronissima air that indicates the possibility to be assigned a seat in the emergency exit row larger than others by paying 50 at checkin desk and overall was pretty good allowing me to stretch my legs cabin crew friendly and professional passing around with water trolleys through all the flight both flights arrived at destination before the time scheduled
15125,nok air,9,best low cost i have used,bangkok to chiang mai with nok air and very impressed definitely the best low cost i have used 15kg luggage allowance boarding and departure in advance as all passengers were in brand new plane free snack onboard and free wifi i am making this review as we just started our descent
15556,onur air,2,onur air customer review,flew 311 diyist with onurair because of the convenient flighttime departure on time plane clean airbus 321 toilets clean but the legroom is awful im only 171 cm but my knees touched the sit in front of me no ife fa cool neutral no smile there was a menu card prices affordable but nobody offered anything the trolley was moved from row ten directly to the back of the plane if you want to go from a to b with no service no smiles use them but turkish is much better
9833,flynas,2,such lack of service,left cairo ok on arrival at riyadh at approx 7pm once on wifi a reminder email arrived telling us of a new flight number and departure time now 11 hours away at 0600 no communication from ground staff about luggage delay any options to stay somewhere nothing at 3am some passengers managed to raise the issue with airport manager who spoke to the flynas manager he then got off his backside issued boarding passes to the 20 odd people stranded and checked luggage is available to hopefully end up at our destination at the same time as us customer service at last such lack of service by a saudi airline does not reflect well on the country
12481,jetstar asia,5,i was a bit disappointed,i booked this return flight from singapore to kuala lumpur as part of another booking so i didnt choose jetstar it is a discount airline with all of their features the crew were fine and the seat was ok as my ticket was codeshared they offered me extra legroom and more luggage allowance my ticket noted that i was entitled to a lunch but surprisingly i was literally thrown a muffin and a bottle of water i was a bit disappointed because if i had booked with a discount airline i would have expected it
3102,air zimbabwe,5,a nasty surprise at harare airport,harare to johannesburg with air zimbabwe tickets on air zimbabwe are not cheaper than other airlines at the airport you will need to pay an additional us50 per person than if you fly using another airline this is because air zimbabwe has not paid the civil aviation authority of zimbabwe caaz the taxes for past passengers so now the caaz obtains these taxes directly from passengers as they are about to leave if you fly ba or saa these taxes are included in the tickets also note that online ticket websites we used gotogate do not publish the additional us50 or any such information on their sites so that you purchase tickets through them only to receive a very nasty surprise at harare airport the flight experience on air zimbabwe itself was not bad
8639,el al israel airlines,1,worst flight ever,prague to tel aviv horrible service provided them wil all the security details needed including place of work cards ids certifications and they still had us investigated as if we were terrorists they came back with new questions all the time and still after all questioning was done we had to wait and wait for too long our bags were opened and our dirty clothes and shoes were put took out of their bags and put on the clean ones worst flight ever a nightmare

20993,tui airways,1,service was excellent,east midlands to orlando sanford the service was excellent it was our first time flying from east midlands and with tui and both were exceptional the cabin crew staff couldnt do enough for us the legroom was excellent choice of entertainment excellent and food was good too
11221,iberia,8,fabulous crew on board,excellent velazquez lounge in madrid with real meal very quick boarding and fabulous crew on board covid precautions well enforced 3 points might be improved entertainment system is outdated with an extremely limited choice of movies as well as poor flight tracking seat cushion is much too hard and access to baggage compartment is nearly impossible too high
13174,kuwait airways,7,i was pleasantly surprised,bangalore to london via kuwait having read poor reviews i was pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort of the planes and the good service both flights were punctual enough and baggage delivery was speedy almost my best experience of flight from india to a hub airport
1533,air dolomiti,7,air dolomiti customer review,flew from pisa to munich on an atr 72 never flew on that model before and was amazed nice aircraft service was ok and the flight arrived on time seating was ok little narrow but then again its only a regional airline the whole operation had an italian charm all in all a nice small charismatic airline
4872,austrian airlines,1,i will never go back with austrian,bad service uninterested crew it was a flight from amsterdam to vienna to sofia may 22nd 2022 the first flight was delayed with 15 hour no information given during the flight we heard that the connection to sofia already left in vienna no help at all they didnt care that you missed your flight no one to help or to guide you go there go there that was it at all the desks i was accused i was too late eventually they rebooked me on a flight from 0400 pm after boarding there were some computer problems waited for one hour no information given then they told us the flight is cancelled and we had to get off the plane again and the crew had the nerve to tell us to have a nice day and see you back soon back at the airport uninterested staff told us that there were no flights anymore that night they could give me a hotel and the next day with lufthansa to paris and from paris to sofia i checked the internet there were also direct flights to sofia in the end i could go with a flight from 0900 pm that night because they put me on a waiting list but only after i did not accept their offer for a hotel i had a 16 hour journey instead of a 5 hour journey that day because of the incompetence of austrian and again the worst thing was their lack of interest they gave me a feeling they didnt want me as a customer they only want my money no service or compassion at all needless to say i will never go back with austrian
20376,thomas cook airlines,7,solid experience on both flights,solid experience on both flights they were punctual and the staff onboard were very approachable and chatty including the captain on the return flight he introduced himself personally in the cabin and was humorous it relaxed everybody the meals were good the airline heavily promotes its collaboration with the chef james martin and this was reflected in some tasty food i would give this category full marks if they were less stingy in the portion sizes and i also think they should make a wine or beer one of the drink options with the meal rather than just tea coffee we are paying extra after all the airlines bag drop facility at manchester is excellent id sent my hold luggage and received my boarding pass within five minutes of entering the terminal also received the luggage in good time upon arrival for both flights a few negatives ife outdated shared screens showing the ubiquitous big bang theory cleanliness the cabin on the return flight was grubby with coffee stains on the backs of seats and used packets of butter on the floor lots of crumbs general stains and dust showed that it had been a while since the plane received a thorough clean the aeroplane on the return flight was newer sharklets and seat spacing was definitely more cramped than on the outbound it seems the airline has tried to squeeze in more seats in its newer models and it became uncomfortable after a while i say this as a man of average height it was also muggy i noticed that the heating controls were set to 22 degrees and thats too warm for squeezedin passengers allinall two decent flights and id fly thomas cook again
3908,alitalia,2,the worst airline ever,this is the worst airline ever starting with a website that is sooo not user friendly to the extremely rude and unprofessional staff on the phone and in the airport nothing like waiting to check in and only 2 people working the counter while 6 people stand around talking to one anothers door theres about 60 people on line lazy doesnt even cover how these people acted the food on the plane was awful you could only have water to drink the food was served prison style no one smiled or even pretended to be happy you felt like they were doing you a favor just being there they picked up the trays of uneaten food and that was the last you saw of these miserable people i did ask why they werent serving and soft drinks i was told it was due to covid restrictions which i found out was false the inflight entertainment was a joke 9 hours of flying with movies from 1990 never again will i fly alitalia
20516,tianjin airlines,8,cabin crew patient and polite,i flew business class sydney to tianjin seat is 222 layout only 3 rows which is a lot less busy than many airlines j class seat comfort good no privacy screens flat bed you never bump your legs to the side board pajamas is provided and amenity is clarins food i will give 35 due to a lack of speciality entertainment is 35 due to a lack of choice the cabin crew decent patient and polite lounge at sydney is skyteam lounge
609,aeromexico,5,disappointing on all fronts,disappointing on all fronts they offer online checkin but there is no bag drop line which means despite having checked in in advance i still had to wait in the same line as people that didnt even have boarding passes furthermore the check in agent informed me that my electronic boarding pass would not work so he issued me a new paper boarding pass the boarding process in yul was chaotic and disorganized i had to connect in mex and luckily i had plenty of time as there was no gate information available not on the boards in the airport not on the app not on the website the aircraft were underwhelming uncomfortable and the service subpar i wont be taking aeromexico again unless absolutely necessary
23125,zipair,8,id highly recommend zipair,a small bottle of water is 2 cup of coffee 4 it is certainly easy enough to bring snacksfood from home or pick something up from the airport just be forewarned you will pay 5080 for any checked bags up to three they did not check the weight of my carryon on the way to japan but did for the return flight and as one of my checked bags was overweight i had to redistribute from on to another there at the checkin counter but that was fine and the agent helped me so i didnt have to pay for an additional suitcase the seat was very comfortable but youre only able to partially recline it there is no video screen no inflight entertainment and the only wifi we were able to access went directly to their service site where you could order food and drinks this is no frills but the airfare was 800 less than any other carrier so even with a connecting flight on southwest and staying overnight in a hotel near the airport in san jose hyatt place highly recommended i still came out 500 under any other fare the days when getting there is half the fun are long gone but if you want a bargain flight price with nice attendants excellent baggage handling excellent crew id highly recommend zipair
10487,go first,1,flight was delayed 4 times,the pathetic service flight was delayed 4 times no one is there to take responsibility or to answer people dont know whom to ask because no single staff is there to attend extremely irritated
20375,thomas cook airlines,5,extremely disappointed,zakynthos to newcastle outbound to zakynthos couldnt be faulted however on the route back we were delayed by 23 hours and not given any information for the majority of the 23 hours we slept on an airport floor for 10 hours with little money and food and the airport didnt offer a lot of food we arrived at the airport at 3am and werent put in accommodation or food until 4pm we then didnt get into an accommodation to sleep in till 8pm after being told we would be leaving at 6pm due to the delay we were told we would be given 400 compensation within 28 days it is now 56 days later and none of my party have received this compensation even after multiple phone calls to thomas cook extremely disappointed with this service
8198,eastern airways,4,will not be using again,i have been using eastern airways for about a year now traveling between humberside and aberdeen for business i started to notice that when i booked some flights it would say only 4 seats left and i would have to pay the middle tier over 200 one way it was always the case i got on the flight to find that there would be about 11 people on there and plenty of empty seats what extra did i get for the higher price nothing same seat as the 165 one nothing different after spending a lot of money with this airline i now travel on train to another airport and i can get 2 flights 2 trains for less then the lowest fare available with eastern airways even flying across the sea i can get cheaper then a domestic flight trouble is some people are stuck and have to use the local airport but if the prices do not start to come down they will end up pushing everyone to other airports and little airports like humberside will end up closing its just greed if other airlines can fly at 60 a seat for a domestic flight then why cant they i will not be using again
19949,thai airasia,7,hot seat which was comfortable,cochin to bangkok departed cochin airport on time this time i booked their hot seat which was comfortable comparing to the standard seat the pre booked meal was ok will fly again with thai airasia in this sector
14458,malaysia airlines,8,the leg room was generous,the flight from langkawi to singapore was a twoflight combination using the b737800 i had booked and paid for exit row 14 on both sectors and the leg room was generous on the first leg wifi streaming entertainment was available while on the second segment personal tv was available as i was seated at the exit window seat 14a the left armrest was a truncated armrest so that it will not block the emergency exit both flight sectors were around 1 hour and shortly after take off a packet of peanuts and orange juice was served being such short flights nothing more was expected
15093,nok air,5,worn out seat dirty windows,i booked with nok air online for my business trip from bangkok dmk to chumphon cjm tax certificate can be easily requested online and delivered to my office even before my journey their website is user friendly and i selected my preferred seat well in advance on departure i was informed that flight would be 50 minutes delayed with no further explanation the aircraft was a 3 years old dash 8 q400 lovely livery but the sign of poor maintenance and improper cleaning are all over interior tray table cannot be used worn out seat dirty windows a small bottle of water is served free of charge by a nice cabin crew i bought a pack of snack which is nice the return flight on atr72 which is an even older aircraft i had to move to a few vacant seats before finally finding one that can be kept upright all in all the experience is fair but i would prefer to fly other airlines if possible
16777,rex airlines,8,meal was fine for a short flight,i enjoyed the flight check in was very easy the service on the plane was very friendly and helpful the meal was fine for a short flight the wine served was excellent i hope rex is here to stay
7684,croatia airlines,4,check in was rude unhelpful,the croatia airlines staff during check in was rude unhelpful and refused without explanation to print out the boarding passes for each part of the flight forcing us to run around trying to get boarding passes before boarding actually starts overall experience with staff at the check in left me under impression that im unavoidable annoyance to the lady who was checking me in very unpleasant experience flight itself was average typical boring flight
20255,thai smile airways,1,excellent full service,excellent full service including light meals on board comfortable seat nice and friendly staff with enthusiasm appropriate time schedule and destination
75,adria airways,4,adria airways customer review,ljublijanaamsterdam a great little airline although the crj200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew their inflight magazine is in english and slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information same cant be said about brnk international airport however this airport needs a spruce up to say the least
16567,qatar airways,3,great seats in business class,great seats in business class qsuite and very well mannered crew i would say that onboard services and staff are as good as it gets and ground service and staff are the complete opposite baggage was destroyed on my outbound flight and customer service has been useless in dealing with the issue and made no effort to resolve the issue before my inbound flight the baggage allowance for business class is 40 kilos the fee for extra baggage ranges from 10kilo up to 18kilos depending on the time you purchase it they forgot one of my special diet meals on of my flights providing me with the breakfast on an overnight flight where 2 meals were offered late dinner and breakfast what made things worse was the stewardess trying to convince me that because i ordered the special meal i only get breakfast then the supervisor came over to admit the mistake and apologise overall very disappointed with one of the alleged best airlines in the world service just does not match the level of product they are claiming to provide needless to say i wont be using them again
2852,air seychelles,5,air seychelles customer review,service was excellent staff friendly meals were good boeing 767200 was very very old my son went to put his seatbelt on and it came off in his hand the seat adjacent to that one had a table that wouldnt stay up they do need new equipment but flight was otherwise uneventful
15991,philippine airlines,1,the most terrible airline,you trust them to answer your questions about the booking and then before the flight it turns out that there was an error we could not tell you they can neither send an official letter with a response nor say the application number for a complaint or request a month before departure i called several times and clarified information on transporting animals on a specific flight they confirmed the transportation of the animal and told me how to proceed send them documents for exporting the animal three days before departure i bought a ticket and three days before departure i sent them all the documents and called to find out the status of the reservation support told me in surprise why did i get the idea that you can fly with an animal i talked with support all evening they even listened to my calls to them before buying a ticket and confirmed that yes it was their mistake and that it was really impossible to bring an animal and why another employee said so they dont know they dont help with a full refund they refer to the fact that it was my mistake when asked to listen to those calls they answer that they suddenly cannot do this and they cannot send the recordings to me either lost time money nerves and strength the most terrible airline

8801,estonian air,2,estonian air customer review,tallinnkievtallinn using estonian air is like using a scheduled bus service in best case they will get you from a to b without any amenities estonian uses b 737500 seat pitch is average both flights were on time luggage arrived as well on board service has to be paid extra for a flight of about 2 hours this is not much i use them because it is the only direct link between tallinn and kiev but if there was any quality airline i would prefer them
17135,royal jordanian airlines,7,ticket is among cheapest,bangkok to kuala lumpur the service is okay cabin is clean meal is good ticket is among cheapest the cabin crew is not so friendly
3983,alitalia,2,no smile no nothing,rome to belgrade this was my first and last flight with alitalia i was so excited to get on this flight once we came to the airport the staff were so rude no smile no nothing onboard my seat was taken by someone else and i have asked to sit next to my wife as we already booked our tickets in advance and booked our seats as well i was told if there is more space you can move to a different seat if not then just need to stay in my current seat we took off 1hr 45min late seats were not comfy at all very hard and no space the service was ok once we took off nothing special once we were coming to a land into belgrade the aeroplane kept on dropping and quiet a few passengers were screaming
17443,sa express,3,sa express customer review,johannesburg lubumbashi return in economy class plane was b737300 flights on time and almost empty on outbound leg requested vegetarian meal and had to show ticket confirmation to get it from surprised flight purser meal was served cold and did not taste good even though it is a short trip of around 25 hours the ticket fare is exorbitant more than usd 900 there is no inflight entertainment
4244,american airlines,2,everything with them is chaotic,chaotic everything with them is chaotic from ticketing to arrival checking in is chaotic dropping off bags chaotic they change gates seats sometimes arrive early others late from crew to ticketing agents all rude my flight just got confused and landed in dulles instead of dca so 1 hour late
5485,batik air,7,my airline of choice,another good flight with batik i go backwards and forwards between perth and denpasar quite often and batik is still my airline of choice for this route in both instances flights were on time was allocated an exit row on both legs thank you so was very comfortable even though on the way home the aircraft was full cabin crew very helpful and attentive especially on the way home given that the flight was more or less a red eye seats are a little uncomfortable in the lumbar area could probably do with some extra padding but can be ignored for a flight of this duration seat back in front of me was a little bit on the dirty side nothing too bad a lot of passengers seem to miss the fact though that this is not the airlines responsibility it is down to the ground handlers who clean the aircraft during turnaround and down time still a nice baggage allowance with batik as well i sincerely hope that they continue to maintain their operations on this route will be more than happy to fly batik air again
1789,air india,7,this was a welcome flight,i took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate the online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger a321 for this sector i had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see also surprisingly on this flight sector i had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich i had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good landing and arrival into blr was also well ahead of time however when the time came to collect the baggage i had noticed that again the new bag tag which i had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that i had just purchased recently and put even last week when i travelled from kolkata to mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off so it seems that air india is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into but other than that this was a welcome flight and i am hoping that the next time i travel they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give
8229,eastern airways,7,eastern airways customer review,leedsbradford to southampton plane was about halffull which seems fairly typical from the other reviews price was higher than flybe but my employer paid everyone else also looked to be travelling on business ie noone else would have been paying the fare themselves either i suspect eastern should be ok with the financial numbers if they can charge high amounts and halffill the plane this would be equivalent to quite a high loading 80 at flybe prices flight itself was good helpful stewardess a very professional outfit excellent that they offer free fasttrack at lba ideal for an early morning flight speaking of which they fly to southampton earlier in the morning than flybe which again is useful its also a really handy route leeds to the south coast
22193,vivaaerobs,1,i asked for a refund and they said no refunds,we booked flights to mexico city for july 4th weekend and today i get an email saying our flight is cancelled i called into viva aerobus customer support and they said that there was no reason listed as to why the flight was cancelled but that they can book me a flight out of a different city san antonio which is about 100 miles away i asked for a refund and they said no refunds they offered a voucher to be used within 80 days but i refused this offer why would i want to book with this carrier again if they cancel flights with no notice and dont offer refunds the agent wouldnt allow me to speak to a supervisor and was very rude and not helpful i went ahead and disputed the cost of the tickets through my credit card company i hope if this happens to other travelers that they each let their credit card company know so that eventually visa or mastercard stop providing payment services to them worst airline ever
8907,ethiopian airlines,7,i had enjoyable flights with ethiopian,both flights were on time the seats were in a 222 configuration with no direct aisle access of window seats plenty of legroom but no privacy due to the rather old seating sufficient entertainment system with good amount of movies and music no wifi at all on both flights because of the aircraft type b7878 crew was helpful and courteous at all times food was average probably because of the pandemic it was more like premium economy all in all i can say i had enjoyable flights with ethiopian
1538,air dolomiti,6,air dolomiti customer review,frequently flown frankfurt to milan linatemalpensa or munich to milan malpensa airline is good and generally on schedule but to my utter disappointment the snack on the return leg frequently is only nonvegetarian planes are usually small so one can expect a bumpy flight
22277,vlm airlines,3,vlm airlines customer review,lcy to antwerp again this time my booking had been transferred to air france system and my eticket details had been incorrectly coded as a paper ticket unable to check in online so joined another long queue had to go to ticket desk where agent blanked me took a phone call and then started talking in french the convenience of the flight is good but the staff are buffoons who really need urgent retraining
7515,copa airlines,1,the most incompetent airline,bag was submitted at checkin counter in so paulo cm758 one bag never arrived 2 bags did arrive ok when i got to lax i contact copa airline for my missing bag and they told me that would contact me back by email but it been almost 3 mouths and still no contact or help from copa i called every week and they put me on hold for one hour and never solve my problem missing bag is probably in so paulo gru the id was attached to the bag and the bag went on conveyor behind checkin desk but im not sure where is my bag copa airlines did not do anything to find my luggage it like they dont care and all my clothing is gone i dont know what to do anymore to get my bag back or to get hold with copa i sent multiple email and no answer please dont flight this airline they are the worst and the most incompetent airline
6608,cathay pacific airways,5,a very disappointing experience,cathay pacifics premium economy left much to be desired cabin crew were not attentive to passengers needs after serving the first meal cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 or so hours of the long flight from vancouver to hong kong no special drinks were offered to premium economy passengers and only standard snacks chocolate bars granola bars peanuts etc were offered upon request the boeing 777300 er cabin is particularly noisy seems it is due to noisy ceiling fans it was a fully booked flight and cabin crew were clearly overwhelmed by the number of passengers on board the aisles are very narrow on the boeing 777 aircraft since cathay is now cramming 10 across seating in economy so passengers can easily be run over and injured by meal and beverage carts overall it was a very disappointing experience with cathay it is not the premium airline it used to be and from what ive experienced it may never be
4662,asiana airlines,5,service was soso,took oz754 from singapore to seoul and was assigned a flight without any personal inflight entertainment i am very surprised at this service was soso food portion and taste was also ok the only good thing is that the leg room is wider i will not consider taking asiana again for my next korea trip
11180,iberia,2,placed in random seats on the back,be cautious when booking i paid in advance 40 per ticket to choose my seats two window and two aisle on the same row 28 and was placed in random seats on the back there were no excuses no compensation and they would not issue me a refund the excuse via email was that when the plane configuration changes the seat assignments may change as well the plane had not changed and i was seated in a middle seat first row the tray table was broken the screen would slide down continuously and i had no room for my personal belongings avoid flying iberia and if you must be very cautious because they are sneaky without shame
12104,jet2com,6,always run out of sandwiches,alicante to leeds bradford flown on many occasions with this airline do not sit between rows 12 and 19 as they always run out of sandwiches and toasties this has happened on every occasion we have been unfortunate to sit in these locations
2657,air nostrum,2,did not speak scandinavian language,our direct sas flight to be operated by cimber from vilnius to copenhagen had been cancelled so sas rerouted us through stockholm the airlines between vilnius and stockholm turned out to be air nostrum seat pitch was the same as with sas cabin staff did not speak any scandinavian language nor lithuanian so announcements including security instructions were carried out in spanish and english and my wife and i didnt understand onboard we wanted to purchase some items such as sparkling water and a sandwich the purser then told that none of the goods from the menu card could be purchased i thought that it was an sas flight operated by another airline and i actually expected sas service however the only reaction to this was that they couldnt do anything because this was air nostrum i then argued that it said sas on the ticket and even the sas logo was painted on the tail wing but also this didnt seem to bother the purser at all she said that all foodbeverage services were only for business class when my wife made it clear that if she actually did get sick during the flight the cabin staff would have a problem the purser got my wife sparkling water
22284,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,frequent traveller amslcyams outstanding ground boarding no buses and onboard service very nice seats and catering more extensive than on other european carriers on a 40min flight cabin crew friendly and attentive no baggage problems and biggest delay so far is 40min i hope now that af kl bought vlm they dont change anything at vlm
16530,qantaslink,7,qantaslink customer review,bnemkybne qantaslink flights but alliance airlines operated the sectors i was on this week so the flight standard should be viewed in that respect the fas on the brisbanemackay run were not good one with a terrible attitude especially towards other crew members which was unfortunately easy to witness however the return run from mackay to brisbane more than made up for the first leg due to exceptionally good cabin service including superb wines and very good ontime performance in the quick and quiet f100s
9266,fastjet,1,i had to book another flight,we were supposed to fly on the 16th march with fastjet only to receive few hours before my flight an email saying that my flight had changed to fn 154 the email that i got was not clear at all not stating which flight had changed no flight number or departure airport was mentioned so i assumed that the flight on the 16th march had changed i emailed the airline but had no response back so i had to book another flight from dar es salam to kilimanjaro which cost me the triple of what i had booked with fastjet i arrived at the airport and went to fastjet desk only to be told that this flight was on time and i was too late the flight was leaving in 35 min i showed them the email and they told me that flight change refers to the returning flight i dont understand how can you change a flight without mentioning the flight number or departure time my return flight changed from 2130 to 1230 needless to say that this flight change didnt suit me at all as i was on a safari and obviously couldnt make it i had to book another flight coming back with precision air as fastjet didnt offer any other flight times and again the cost was triple i expected a refund for this inconvenience as it was totally unfair what the airline did and the cost for the other flights that i had to rebook was ridiculous however none of this happened
5789,blue1,7,blue1 customer review,helosl checkin was rude and dismissive but otherwise the flight had very nice crew and the plane was spotless clean as well bob meal is cheaper on blue1 than on sas due to the currency and i found the quality to be rather reasonable as well ontime departure and arrival in oslo ticket price was great as usual
2551,air new zealand,2,do not ignore your customers,i am appalled by their lack of customer service i purchased an air new zealand flight through edreams back in may 2021 the flight unfortunately had to be cancelled due to border entry restrictions due to the covid outbreak i have from july last year to present day been fighting to get my money back all 1900 euros of it i contacted edreams they tell me they are waiting for the refund from air nz i contact air nz they tell me edreams holds my money i now have an email proof from edreams to say that they are still awaiting a refund from air nz which i have now sent to the customer service department but i doubt i will get any answers because they blatantly ignore all emails i send if you are selling your flights through a scam company then you are just as much responsible for fighting our case because the flight your companies flight was booked in good faith and the matter of the refund needs to be sorted do not ignore your customers
2291,air mauritius,8,crew very friendly,mauritius to durban luckily we sat in the front row with the babies and kids the legroom was excellent however the legroom for the other seats i noticed was miserable tall passengers with their legs in the aisle aircraft was clean crew very friendly and breakfast excellent on this 4 hour flight however after 1 month i still have not been credited with my miles in my air france account pretty annoying
18078,silkair,9,good in flight service,singapore to yogyakarta very comfortable seats only 31 inch pitch but seats are not thick so space between seats seems more than normal good in flight service meal and drinks beer and soft drinks etc but no wine staff are professional and readily assist when needed overall good value and efficient airline
6546,cathay dragon,9,satisfactory for a regional sector,hong kong to qingdao the check in process was in order and prompt this flight was operated by cathay dragon a330300 which boarding gate was assigned to terminal 1 when i arrived at the boarding gate there were many passengers waiting for the gate the boarding announcement was called approximately 50 minutes prior to departure the process was conducted row by row in systematically order which special needs passengers are given priority being a marco polo green member i had the advantage of queuing at the special lane dedicated to the airlines frequent flyers flight attendant were busy greeting and assisted us to the assigned seat once boarded the flight to qingdao left the gate on time and was relatively full cathay dragon is renowned for being one of the best regional airlines lunch and cold beverages were served shortly after take off the cabin crew returned to serve hot beverages two selection were available on board that is hot coffee and tea hot beverages were served without meal cart and the process is usually faster overall flight experience was smooth and satisfactory for a regional short sector i look forward to fly with cathay dragon again in the near future
2745,air serbia,4,disappointing experience,22 flights delayed by at least an hour with no explanation no staff around to ask questions or give an estimated departure time overall disappointing experience even though staff were present were courteous
15552,onur air,4,otherwise i would avoid,very small seats and drinks were not free boarding was very disorganized and we sat well past the boarding time with no explanation the price was decent but would take turkish airlines instead if the price was anywhere near onur air verdict if onur air price is much better than turkish airlines and the flight is short it might be worth it but otherwise i would avoid
39,adria airways,5,service onboard was poor,frankfurt to ljubljana with adria airways boarding was ontime but aircraft was parked on remote gate about 15 minutes from main terminal so we departed about 25 minutes late service onboard was poor with no complimentary drinks or snacks they are available only for sale arrival was 15 minutes later than scheduled crew was friendly
20484,thomson airways,7,kindness and consideration,tenerife south to birmingham with thomson airways the aisle seat in the row in which my wife were sitting was occupied by an elderly disabled lady my reason for writing the review is the kindness and consideration shown by the cabin staff who were very friendly to this lady
20611,tigerair,7,smooth flight and seat reasonably comfortable,flight was delayed by 2 hours they would have known this at the time of checkin but said nothing until departure time came and went and still no incoming aircraft and even then only when a couple of us demanded an update on board experience was fine smooth flight and seat reasonably comfortable a special mention for the food i preordered a vegetarian tomato koora this was small and predominantly rice but has to be one of the tastiest meals i can remember airline or otherwise i would fly tigerair again but i would make sure as i did this time that i allowed a long gap between connecting flights
4435,ana all nippon airways,4,the food was below average,flew ana from sydney to haneda economy and haneda to heathrow premium economy and same reverse premium economy was via a bid process flight for economy was reasonable for the cost while the premium economy wasnt as expected in that the degree of recline was less than i expected the range of movies on the vod system was very limited and the food was below average customer service from the fas was however excellent where they were very attentive and courteous immediatly offering eye masks and ear plugs on boarding
21266,turkmenistan airlines,3,air crew were miserable,birmingham to amritsar via ashgabat with turkmenistan airlines flight time was moved forward by a few hours and we were not notified when we arrived at airport they were already boarding the aircraft fortunately we could still check in and did not miss our flight to india staff are a bit disorganised seats were allocated so couples sat on opposite ends of the aircraft which did not make any sense the return flight was due to leave at 9am but did not depart until later in the afternoon we were not provided with any refreshment or information during the long delay the aircrew were miserable no in flight entertainment and food was average to tasteless the curry spice foods are too spicy hot to eat if delayed for 5 hours they should have at least provided fresh water and sandwiches in the airport free of charge no apology partial refund or refreshments were given
16965,royal brunei airlines,3,lack of customer service,appalled at the complete lack of customer service following a complaint prior to my 21 hour flight i purchased a better seat for 120 only to then have a broken seat on the second 145 hour leg of the journey resulting in being more uncomfortable than anyone else ive reasonably requested the refund of the extra 120 i paid but all ive received is a meek apology
22947,xiamen airlines,8,the crew was attentive,kuala lumpur to shenyang via xiamen the crew was attentive especially to the elderly chinese on board checking if they are comfortable and needs drink their food is very chinese and tasty i like that they served steamed corn at the end what i didnt like lack of inseat entertainment

12038,jet airways,4,no jet airways again,mumbai to bangalore on 28th nov 235 pm flight as i was relocating to a new place required to carry extra luggagethey charged me hefty amount for my extra luggage weight and even a charge for an extra piece of baggage earlier it was 25kg which has reduced to 15kg food and services have too gone down though in the flight i realized many seats were empty they could have easily waived the charge no jet airways again
7417,condor airlines,5,inflight staff are the shining light,overall an ok experience the outbound flight was delayed by 3 hours due to an instrument light that needed a physical signoff by a technician that was 2 hours away if this was an isolated event that would be one thing but reading numerous reviews before booking my flight it sounds like this happens quite frequently shame on me i guess the condor 767s are rather old from my understanding 28 years on average so it seems like this problem could be better planned for this delay caused me to miss my connecting flight with lufthansa which was a whole other ordeal in and of itself the return flight was uneventful thankfully the only issue was that my digital boarding pass listed an incorrect seat i specifically paid for an aisle seat with premium entertainment so that caused me to feel pretty anxious when i got to the gate in frankfurt i asked the desk agent about my digital pass only to have him largely ignore me he then printed a new boarding pass that had my correct seat what this was about i dont know the cabins arent bad seats are ok and the inflight staff are the shining light for this airline they were polite and attentive and i appreciated their help
15051,nok air,6,everything about the flight was low cost,the cheerful canary yellow uniforms of the flight crew are matched by the livery of their aircraft if only the happiness went into their attitude as well yes they are a lowcost carrier and i am sure the crew doesnt have the same work environment as the crews of higherend airlines but that is no justification for a bad attitude everything about the flight was low cost they have so much potential at least they had a skybridge at dmk and hkt
9167,eva air,4,dropped in standards,i am disabled and had first class care at both airports however the flights were dreadful on the outward flight to bangkok we had paid extra both ways for an aisle seat for me as i cant climb over due to my disabilities we were 2 rows back from the exit row seats and just before take off i noticed they were free i ask one of the crew politely if due to my disability we may move she said yes but it will be 150 each and you have to pay in cash i thought she was joking and then she repeated 300 cash during the flight i went to use the toilet closest to us and again due to my disability found it difficult due to the size when i came out i stood to stretch my legs and a fellow passenger told me that at the rear of the plane they had a disabled toilet so next time i went to the rear and there it was it was occupied so i waited a few minutes until a crew member came and said the normal toilet is free across the other side she saw i had my walking stick and i said i will wait until this one is free she said it is not occupied but locked for staff use only i asked if due to my disability i could use it and she just said no crew only i was amazed i have to say on both these issues plus the general attitude of all the crew on the outward flight the food had also dropped in standards as well
11583,interjet,2,mean nasty and unpleasant,medellin to mexico city this was my first interjet flight the only good news is the flight was on time and we landed safely on the negative side i can honestly say i have never seen a crew on any airline so mean nasty and unpleasant im a 60 year old guy and asked for some water late in the flight the flight attendant snapped at me and said no we have no water they did not distribute landing cards before landing i had to ask for them as i left the flight they gave me one of the two required i saw them in customs and called them out on all of this their mean nasty attitudes unwillingness to pass out customs forms i dont need to be abused by these people if it was my company they all would be fired already for their lack of professionalism and disgraceful behavior amazingly when i walked them out on their nastiness they agreed with me and acknowledged it also their website is disingenuous they talk about wifi connectivity video screens audio all on some flights there is zippo unfortunately my return flight is in interjet but i will never fly them again and could not recommend
2652,air nostrum,6,expect better from air nostrum,alicante to madrid uncoordinated ground staff who left 2 wheelchair users waiting without communication for over 30 minutes in a communal area checkin was laborious with one staff member conducting personal conversation rather than processing her passengers boarding was slow very slow indeed two wheelchair users were left in a hot area without communication and were then boarded first this was no problem other than other passengers being required to descend narrow stairs and wait for a bus the bus was very full and needed to make 2 journeys passengers were allowed to carry with them far too much luggage and this proved to be problematic in the extreme following departure the staff were poorly coordinated and communication was poor arrival was prompt but a bus was needed to negotiate a very large madrid airport clearly much needs to be done to improve matters one would expect better from air nostrum
15420,olympic air,8,olympic air customer review,athensvienna return on a319 cabin interior lavatories clean seat pitch quite comfortable candies and newspapers offered after boarding hot meal served and plenty of cold and hot beverages cabin crew polite and professional inflight magazine was average there was no videomusic entertainment available
20068,thai airways,4,service attitude lacking,no lounge access at mumbai even for business class only tg class does not provide this all other airlines provide no amenities no even a pair or socks no champagne they did offer a cheap and disgusting prosecco no food or drink menus just a verbal and mechanical choice provided service attitude lacking big time cabin condition left a lot to be desired not going to fly tg business class unless i have no other option
12171,jetairfly,5,we had a 14 hour delay,brussels to cancun with jetairfly booked 4 days before the flight and didnt know what to expect tickets were quite cheap less then 400 we knew there was very strict security so we arrived at the airport 4 hours before takeoff we queued for almost 2 hours we took off on time but there were some gear problems and we had to make an emergency landing after we landed we had to stay in the plane for 1 hour when we finally got out they gave us a voucher for food and told us to come back to the gate at 130 pm when we came back a few hours later the plane still wasnt fixed and again they gave a voucher for food and told us to come back at 530 pm when we came back at 530 pm there was no one from jetairfly who could help us after 1 hour finally someone came and he told us there was another plane who would take us to cancun because it was a new plane we had to get new boarding passes it took them quite a while to do this this was 815 pm unfortunately the boarding system was also broken so they had to manually process everyone by 830 pm we were the first on the plane and after 1 hour we finally took off the new plane didnt have entertainment but because we flew by night that was not a big issue i know jetairfly couldnt do anything about the airplane being broken but when you tell your passengers to be at the gate at 530 pm there has to be at least 1 person available and that was not the case this time after all we had a 14 hour delay the good thing the return flight was much better and we got some money back
20804,transaero airlines,2,transaero airlines customer review,lhrdme we flew an ageing 737 the plane was packed and everyone had a lot of hand luggage so there was little room for storage cabin crew were completely indifferent to boarding passengers and did their best to ignore them absolutely no assistance was offered the steward at the front of the plane used his position to glare at everyone departure was delayed for about an hour of course no announcements we were offered a soft drink and that was the last liquid we saw for the next 35 hours one got the impression that the cabin crew had decided that it wasnt worth the bother of attending to passengers and they all walked about with morose and sulking expressions i would only ever consider transaero if the price was significantly lower
3494,airasia x,4,not happy with this flight,i was on airasia x flight from seoul to kuala lumpur the flight duration was 6 hours plus and the cabin was warm i was seated at quiet zone window seat 8k and had to endure the warmth informed the air stewardess to check the air conditioner and she replied would check with captain but she never returned nor the condition had improved the seat and leg room are narrow and designed not for comfort food quality dropped too the pak nasser nasi lemak is not fresh and tasted salty not happy with this flight
11024,hong kong airlines,4,quite low price we paid,bangkok to los angeles via hong kong first of all the hong kong airlines website is really clunky and bad the error messages are cryptic and useless at best we were not able to check in online and got different error messages each time we purchased vip lounge passes but only received 1 via emailtext and was unable to attach them to our itinerary or my frequent flier account i was unable to make an ff account for my wife again useless error messages check in lines were pretty long and boarding was poorly managed we paid extra for the extra legroom seats for the hkg to lax and return and if those have 3 extra legroom id hate to sit in a normal seat the seats were also hard and uncomfortable i have flown a number of other asian carriers singapore eva korean primarily and all had much more comfortable normal seats the food was poor and very little choice no selfserve snacks no menu provided only chinesestyle food and it just wasnt that good there was limited waterjuice service throughout the flight considering the quite low price we paid it was reasonable but if you look at other seasons the prices are not even competitive with airlines with better service i think our fare was somewhat of a fluke
16634,qatar airways,2,seats were not comfortable,you have to watch a lot of advertising about qatar during the flight the seats were not comfortable the flight attendants were friendly but overchallenged with the service i had to wait more than half an hour to get a can of beer they wouldnt give me enough water my request for any snacks was friendly denied two times in a row i cannot recommend this airline
21549,uzbekistan airways,6,a wonderful journey,i experienced a wonderful journey with uzbekistan airways my flight is from kuala lumpur to istanbul and we transit at tashkent airport for 9 hours we can only be able to enter a business lounge 3 hours before our flight so we just sat around the airport performed our prayers as a muslim and they have comfortable praying areas at the airport the business lounge check in was fast and excellent
18676,south african airways,5,serving lunch at 0930,johannesburg to maputo i like saa and they are always punctual what i take exception to is their business class cabins on the a319 aircraft with 5 across seating noticeably different to their a320s with only 4 across saa should not be selling the middle seat to ensure conformity as the airline is struggling financially i would have though it cant afford to alienate premium customers but henceforth if a flight is operated with an a319 ill downgrade to economy and save a small fortune serving lunch at 0930 in the morning is silly most passengers wanted tea and coffee and the crew had a trolley full of wine and champagne net effect the crew really struggled to effectively serve hot drinks to a full cabin they did just about manage but its obvious here whoever makes the catering decisions at saa has done so to make hisher life easier not the crew or the passengers
11198,iberia,4,i will never fly iberia again,worst customer service the airline lost our luggage i had to call multiple times daily to try and find it i was sent to a voice mail to leave a message which were never returned when i did get a customer service agent i would be redirected multiple times and no answers this process took 5 days yes 5 days without luggage the customer servicebaggage claim was no help at all i finally got help from the airport that did not have any association with iberia but they took the time to look and guess what my bag was sitting in their holding area noone at iberia ever called if it was up to iberia i still would not have my luggage when i arrived home i noticed that my bag was damaged i call customer service again after 20 minutes on the phone i got sorry theres nothing we can do i will never fly iberia again
16398,qantas airways,6,service was poor,this must be the prime business route for qantas and very important for them given all the options now available with other airlines the service was poor well meaning staff but chaotically managed the food on this and other stages was nondescript and unattractively served long delays between courses and collecting up no help offered with preparing bedding etc the whole experience emphasised how by comparison ba has managed to spruce up and recover its business service standards and is for the moment an incomparably better way of getting to and from australia
17001,royal brunei airlines,5,lack of consistency disappointing,bangkok to melbourne via bandar seri bagawan youd swear this was a different airline it started ok though check in was quick and we had an express pass through security and immigration which was a blessing we had a pass given to us for the air france lounge oh my trying to find this was a huge challenge they really need better signage in this massively large busy airport fortunately the lounge wasnt far from the gate the flight to bandar seri bagawan was unremarkable nice food and comfortable on arrival in bsb we walked to transfers to be met and told our plane was in the uk with a cracked windscreen and that our melbourne flight was postponed the staff were very good and had pre filled immigration forms for us walked us through there and put us in a taxi to a hotel for the night with a voucher for a meal there the same taxi driver met us in the morning and took us back to the airport went to the lounge for breakfast and eventually a plane arrived we heard it came from jeddah the flight home however was disappointing there were only nine of us in business yet staff were hard to find they seemed to run to the back a lot we were told brusquely get your trays ready meals will come soon we got the first and second course then nothing pillows were distributed no duvet entertainment was extremely limited it felt like a different airline to our outgoing experience i did ring the call bell for a tea later on nothing was ever offered during the flight the lack of consistency was disappointing overall we arrived finally our bags were not long to arrive
8966,etihad airways,3,worst experience is t3 abu dhabi,its cheaper than emirates but by no means cheap all the planes are quite dated if i had paid for business id want my money back the food on our november flight here was the worst food ive ever had on an airline inedible the trip from istanbul where the turkish people have much pride was excellent from syd to abu dhabi and abu dhabi to athens foul i have always found the cabin crew to be polite so no dramas there the worst experience is t3 abu dhabi it has got to be the worst airport ive ever had the displeasure of using t3 is dedicated to etihad and the facilities are so substandard one toilet block for multiple gates with few toilets also downstairs so a big hassle then the security you pass through the usual security buy some water on way to gate and then it is confiscated at the actual hate wtf then you have to sit in gate and wait with no access to water why not put the vending machine inside the gate and whats the point of security if the check is disregarded and you have to be checked all over again at the gate only airline and airport this has ever happened to me this experience is likely a reason i will pay extra and fly emirates next time
17906,shanghai airlines,7,shanghai airlines customer review,bkkpvg had window seat but middle seat unoccupied so i got to stretch out cabin crew spoke little english but were friendly chicken with rice and veggies acceptable economy airline food
9551,firefly,4,firefly customer review,penang to subang kl and back to penang flight was around 20 myr 5usd more expensive than mas or air asia however since subang is so much closer to the city i felt it was well worth it subang airport has been refurbished and is very modern in comparison to my first visit when firefly was founded new atr 72500 are also much nicer planes to fly than the old fokker 50 checkin was efficient and flights were slightly late boarding but made up time in the air and arrived on time the crew was friendly and efficient however not as welcoming as the mh crew firefly is a subsidiary of mh they served fruit juice and a small piece of cake for this 35min trip not bad and good value for money

13600,laudamotion,1,not to press the service button,dusseldorf to alicante two and a half hours late due to late incoming aircraft excuse but then we had to stand for at least three minutes in the rain on the steps to the aircraft i ordered coffee and snacks for my group and when i tried to pay by credit card was told the the machine didnt work could have told me before i ordered no milk and sugar was given i like it black and bitter anyway but the rest of the group asked for some my coffee was only half full and after waiting five minutes i pressed the service button and asked for it to be filled it was and i was told not to press the service button again unless it was an emergency i never heard that before the milk and sugar for the rest of the group never came

177,aegean airlines,4,no warm food was offered,boarding was done with bus to remote location cabin staff were just professional but not friendly in flight service breakfast was in a cardboard box consisting of a cream and a sweet in plastic there was a option of sandwiches but they ran out with the high priced ticket a shame to provide such inflight service no warm food was offered the flight was on time ife was done through your mobile telephone and there was very limited viewing options
17740,scoot,4,next time will pay extra,we flew with scoot on our singaporesydney route on the way back from the uk which we booked through singapore airlines however we were disappointed we paid a little bit extra for a scoot in silence seat which was like a small economy area where children werent allowed food was pretty terrible but included however drinks were not included except for water we had brought our own water on board but had to pay for any extra drinks which i wasnt happy about no entertainment system so come prepared with your own devices i wouldnt fly scoot again and next time will pay extra to fly with singapore airlines the whole way

14372,mahan air,9,consider to fly this airline again,tehran to copenhagen excellent value for money traveling alone with a baby can be challenging but i found check in and boarding procedures smooth and without delays the flight attendants were young and very nice to us a340 with smart and clean cabin food and nonalcoholic beverages was plentiful as a hot breakfast was served at the beginning of flight and a cold refreshment before landing in copenhagen this was a 5 hour flight and i did not expect that inflight entertainment could be improved this was a great flight and i would consider to fly with this airline again in the future
3963,alitalia,5,alitalia has improved,rome to london historically my flights with alitalia have never been pleasant most frequent occurrence the lost baggage surprisingly regardless of its financial position alitalia has improved flights were on time baggage wasnt lost and service was decent the preflight auction for business class is also a great idea well the lack of politeness of an italian cabin crew and the ridiculously narrow seat pitch are not a surprise at all
2405,air namibia,6,happy with the overall experience,windhoek to frankfurt after having read reviews i was prepared for bad service and problems during the flight but luckily everything was fine and i am quite happy with the overall experience the aircraft is spacious and clean seats are comfortable and have a pillow and a blanket for each passenger the crew was 50 very friendly and 50 not so good cop bad cop the food was quite good however it might have been better maybe a dessert could be added big selection of drinks but only one type of juice orange on the long overnight flight dinner and breakfast have been offered during the flight the crew also offered water the entertainment system is still not working it seems to be a persistent problem that the airline is not willing to solve
8234,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,souncl return more expensive than flybe but much better product my concern is only 6 pax up 9 back on jetstream 41might have been slack day but these load factors cannot be profitable hope they continue as all routes been competition
19093,srilankan airlines,8,cabin crew is very pleasant and helpful,heathrow to colombo seat numbers 36a and 36c the cabin crew is very pleasant and helpful the screen was not working in 36a and cabin crew tried a lot to sort out the issue it came once after their several attempts and then it didnt work consistently but greatly appreciate the effort that they put and it was something out of their control also they gave a nice service and other members in the crew was willing to help for anything we requested food was ok though it was a fixed menu for veg and non veg would like to propose more ppi kind of apron that they can use and throw away after each service to the crew in this pandemic cleaning of the table is not acceptable
3371,airasia philippines,2,missed my international flight,the fight got delayed from kalibo to malina for almost 3 hours on jan 1 2019 for that i missed my international flight when i asked them for a solution they rebooked my flight which is 2 days later they said thats the only flight with an available seat i have to bear all the losses my schedule has been shattered i have to pay two days accommodation fee and extra costs but those were not the worst part at the checkin counter i asked the checkin lady to provide me with a paper for the delay so my hotel i was supposed to stay could redeem me the lady reassured me that they would bring the paper at my next check in that is jan 2 10 pm flight took off at 0005 am and i asked them to not forget the paper on my next checkins no paper the checkin lady was not willing to help anyway she is very reluctant i asked her many times she just said wait still nothing is done

15573,onur air,3,onur air customer review,we flew from stansted and got there early to book extra leg room my husbands tall and requires this for three months both thomas cook and ourselves have been trying to book extra leg room with this airline the telephone number published isnt answered and the system throws you out repeatedly just when you think you are nearly there and are about to pay for seats journey to antalya was great as a result our return was a nightmare once again we got to the airport early paid for row one 4 seats at 2000 per seat fine if thats what it takes to be comfy we were happy when boarding our seats were changed to row 2 but we had paid for row 1 they said sorry but these had been prebooked this service didnt exist as a result we waited for our refund and my husband flew in the tightest space possible his knees were into the chair in front are the pitches aimed at five footers he was so uncomfortable as a result we came home with a bitterness about the holiday and the airline
15252,norwegian,1,i found the process confusing,oakland to oslo in october 2019 the flight was booked for a price of 80351 round trip total for myself and my companion for each leg we were provided an opportunity to bid for an upgrade for each leg i intended to bid 10 additional about 40 in each case but i found the process confusing i was shocked to find that i was billed a total of 183450 for the trip which is a 128 increase in the fare as opposed to my intended 10 increase i contacted norwegian air and was refused any adjustment in the end this confusing upgrade process and refusal to provide a reasonable settlement appears to be a corporate strategy to enhance the bottom line with no regard for customer satisfaction
11235,iberia express,3,delay of 45 minutes at first,while there would be a delay of 45 minutes at first we were still not on board after 115 am we have a connection in madrid with an originally 80minute transfer as it stands were not going to make it i hope they have a good solution for this

21229,turkish airlines,6,ife is disappointing,food on the bishkek to istanbul leg was woeful it was an awful sort of mini ham and cheese sandwich food on the much shorter istanbul to amsterdam route was delicious however with chicken in a sort of yoghurt sauce crew on both legs were friendly ife is disappointing on turkish its a bit annoying having to board past business who are already enjoying their orange juices and canapes
11844,japan airlines,3,seat had no storage,melbourne to tokyo did not get off to a good start when business check in was cluttered with economy passengers then ushered to economy desk lounge was an insult to business class passengers on board the seat while comfortable had no storage window aisles had some first business class flight i have flown where a welcome drink was not offered amenity kit had no socks i did not eat on the aircraft but the flight crew were attentive and polite i doubt i would choose this airline again for business class travel which is a shame as i had previously flown premium economy and found them brilliant
16415,qantas airways,2,dissatisfied with the lack of service,the cabin service and the meal was poor as well as being inconsiderate to the person sitting beside me firstly the usual glass of wine was not available on departure they ran out of meal choice when they reached my row the person beside was an elderly woman of her way home to scotland she did not like the noodles that were the only offer as the meal she asked for an alternative an economy class meal was offered it had not arrived after about an hour at this point my elderly neighbour gave up and told the steward she no longer wanted the meal the manager then came as the woman complained about the lack of service the manager talked down to the elderly woman telling her you dont always get the meal you want the woman was continuing on from brisbane on an emirates flight to scotland she tells me she flies business class every year to new zealand she was happy to know that her next trip later this year will not require a flight on qantas as emirates will be flying all the way to nz i very rarely fly qantas choosing other airlines it is only out of necessity will i consider them again their treatment of this elderly woman was appalling and i was also dissatisfied with the lack of service and poor quality of the meal
14547,malindo air,1,most uncomfortable seats,denpasar to perth via kuala lumpur previous 6hour flight from kuala lumpur to perth most uncomfortable seats ever narrow seats with minimal leg room no charge for carryons water confiscated by malindo security 3rd security checkin airport consequently water would need to be purchased onboard at an inflated price a fourhour flight from denpasar to kuala lumpur charged us 17900 for two checked bags for total weight the seats however were more comfortable than on the 6hour flight from kuala lumpur to perth
13276,lan airlines,7,seats are too narrow,sydney santiago via auckland on 7879 above average flight with an average meal very good crew and reasonable ife selection however the 9 abreast in economy is too tight the seats are too narrow and the aisles are tiny the meal trolley only just fits through the tray table is also very small on the return leg a passenger fell ill immediately after takeoff the crew managed this very well about 2 hours into the flight it was determined that wed have to return to scl the airline put us into hotels as a transit passenger through scl the airline arranged to pay our reciprocity fee us100 to enter into chile this was a long process over 1 hour but at least they paid for it the airline wasnt able to arrange a single large bus to take us to the hotel at the last minute and so there was another long process about 15 hours of getting all of us into separate mini buses the hotel was excellent and included free food back to the airport this time in a big coach and a very long checkin process our bags were checked through to syd and we were advised wed been put onto a qantas flight from akl to syd the flight was again reasonable good crew ok food definitely not up to emirates standards and bathrooms kept clean due to our delayed arrival into akl we had to overnight there and again lan had arranged a hotel meal and bus transfer for us overall lan managed this stressful situation which was out of their control quite well ensuring we had a place to rest and food to eat and made sure we all got to our final destinations my lower marks are for the standard and quantity of the food and the cramped seating that almost all operators of the 787 have adopted
14835,monarch airlines,8,monarch airlines customer review,manchester man palma pmi efficient check in service at manchester the flight was on time and upon arrival at the aircraft the crew were very welcoming we departed 25 minutes late however this was not due to monarch it was due to the large amount of flights at manchester that morning lots of the variety for snacks and drinks however maybe a little overpriced i purchased a meal deal 750 this was very tasty not much legroom and little uncomfortable i have to admit i prefer the old monarch interior than the new one though landed on time and good updates from the cockpit palma pmi manchester man again efficient check in service at palma with the iberia ground staff again i had the meal deal it was the old monarch interior the seats were more comfortable more legroom and just generally nicer and brighter cabin cabin crew were fantastic and really enjoyed the flight i would fly with monarch again and it was great value for money
1812,air india,8,overall good customer service,overall good customer service quick checkin 3 meals on syd del sector and one meal del bom sector staff were attentive and courteous decent leg space normally 787 has a high level of humidity and moisture but these aircraft were very dry dont know did they change the settings as a result you feel quite dry on these flights i was lucky my entertainment unit worked but the volume is always high the aircraft was clean but their bathroom stinks except for the bathroom and entertainment all went well
15001,niki,5,nikis service is not that good,niki is no low cost airline anymore if it ever was one flights between large european cities cost up to 100 and more also my flight from vie to fco was not cheap but nikis service is not that good the only thing niki offers you compared to other airlines is a cold and ugly sandwich plus a soft drink but it is not worth the price however the ground staff which in fact were staff from the airport were experienced and friendly despite that the cabin crew was unkind and sloppy and their englishskills had been disastrous the ife was made up of a safety video and a map not more
14516,malindo air,4,crew made a good first impression,i didnt have high expectations from malindo air but despite this my flight was a disappointment on various fronts new years eve is not a busy time to fly and as expected the flight was only 60 full the crew made a good first impression but the flaws started appearing early in the flight both lavatories had not a drop of soap in them and the crew confirmed they have no soap at all the temperature inside the cabin was very cold and if this wasnt bad enough the air conditioning was blowing at full force this was true even once we landed and waited to disembark the onboard meals are reasonably priced but they come with only one a 350 ml water the menu doesnt display prices for water bottles only soft drinks the cabin was clean and the crew provides good service
12807,kenya airways,1,staff very unhelpful and dismissive,the most horrible customer experience i have ever had with an airline i have ended up being charged triple the original price i paid despite the fact that i called the customer contact center day before flight issued with last minute information to rebook my flight 15 hours before the flight i dont think i have anything nice to say about my experience dont think i can recommend the airline to another airport staff very unhelpful and dismissive and dont think i will ever consider to use the airline ever again

6454,caribbean airlines,2,the worst experience i have had,i have been flying to jamaica for years and this flight has been the worst experience i have had my flight from kingston back to new york was supposed to take off at 730pm on september 02 i checked in around 5pm and i was told the flight was delayed i sat in my seat for another two hours only to hear from a vendor in airport that my flight was canceled it was not announced to us and i sat there thinking i was going home that night i went to the information desk and then they finally told me that the flight was canceled and i have a choice of going to a hotel or going back to where i was staying they didnt have any information about when the next flight would be or what was the cause for it to be canceled around after one the next morning i received a call letting me know that they have a flight at 630am i checked in around 5am and once again my flight was delayed i board the plane after 7am and my plane did not take off till 9am that morning my overall experience with caribbean airlines was a disgrace this is not an experience that i would like to deal with again
6519,cathay dragon,6,an unremarkable experience,kuala lumpur to hong kong the first leg of a trip to iad checkin at klia was very efficient and the checkin staff were very helpful the boarding process was handled well with cx staff on hand making clear announcements the plane was old and tired and the tray table was dirty stained with spilled food and orange juice on board the fas were pleasant and efficient but thats where it ended there was no personal interaction of any sort they did their jobs well and efficiently but thats it the food was disappointing small portions and not great in flavour the ife was good with an extensive choice of programs generally an unremarkable experience but we did leave on time
20432,thomson airways,4,do not whatsoever pay for extra space seats,flew thomson from manchester to jamaica do not whatsoever pay for extra space seats on this aircraft and choose row 30 b c g or h they are right by the toilets and other passengers use the space in front of you to queue for the toilet or stand and chat they completely ignore the fact that you have paid for the extra space and sometimes even try to get around 8 people all stood in the space at one time nothing done by the stewards or stewardesses to elevate the problem
17615,saudi arabian airlines,5,offered terrible customer service,i am a member of the loyalty programme of saudia i had 3kgs extra in an exercise mat that could not be taken as hand luggage i understand that rules are rules however i was told that the issue was not the excessive weight i then suggested wrapping the mat with my main check in luggage and was told that this was not allowed i told them that i had done this with saudia recently the staff involved were unable to show me where it says that this was not allowed the ground staff let the airline down and i ended up paying excessively without being told the reason was it that my ticket allowed only one piece of luggage why could i not carry some weight on my backpack if this would mean being charged less the staff were absolutely unhelpful and offered terrible customer service as passengers we deserve to have things explained to us i will not be in a hurry to fly saudi from london heathrow anytime soon
2964,air tahiti nui,8,air tahiti nui customer review,paris cdg to los angeles good food crew entertainment and leg space i enjoyed the whole island theme that was experienced onboard a plus about the entire experience was the level of visibility and attention the crew provided with frequent water runs and prompt responses to call bell another feature was the snack bar set up at the galley for passengers flight departed and arrived on time

7479,copa airlines,8,satisfied with my two flights,i was satisfied with my two flights with copa to and from curaao the airport at pty is spacious with plenty of staff on hand boarding was efficient on both sectors and sufficient overhead space despite busy flights i was seated in the last row of economy which was uncomfortable when the pax in front reclined but i was unable to the crew asked him to come forward during the snack service so i could enjoy my banana chips and drink outside of the service i requested coffee which was promptly delivered in a friendly manner on the return the airport staff obliged to seat me in the exit row i find the prices offered online extremely high for the length of flight the crew gave a good briefing for seating in this row there was some light entertainment on the overhead screen and also some recent music in the inseat audio flight arrived in pty t1 but with a clear announcement and signage made my way to t2 to collect baggage and clear customs

12613,jetstar pacific,5,jetstar pacific customer review,after reading all of the reviews warning us of delays and cancelled flights we opted to fly jetstar pacific from hcm to danang fully aware of the ramifications for our actions the price was too good to resist and we couldnt see the point of paying triple that with vietnam airlines check in was a slight issue with flights being cancelled left right and centre the poor staff did their best to deal with an array of angry and difficult customers but what do you expect for the money you paid our flight was delayed 10 hours but staff were lovely and moved us to an earlier flight so we only had to wait 5 hours in saying this we noticed all of the vietnam airlines flights were delayed as well due to weather or late aircrafts i was happy we hadnt paid an excessive amount to still be sitting around at the airport if you want to fly out of hcm i would recommend jetstar for their excellent prices however next time i would opt to get the bus and avoid delays altogether
14152,lufthansa,3,the first and last time,lufthansa allows a standard hand luggage 55cm 8kg plus 1 item laptop bag no weight requirement entering the plane there was no space at all to place a hand luggage in the cabin overhead bin that was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items jackets etc i informed a flight attendant about this she apologetically told me i know but now it is difficult to fix this an attitude i respected although the problem was not fixed a bit later another flight attendant tried to help me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag then i told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit he just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg which is a cheap lie according to the official website of lufthansa and everyone has done the same here that is rudeness at a different level ive never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically 1st time flying with lufthansa though maybe thats the problem here he also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat that sounded so ridiculous all in all instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft i have never seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights ive been present to the contrary all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting i will certainly never use lufthansa again it was the first and last time i did and i would discourage anyone using this airline that does not care about customer service at all
7917,cubana airlines,2,cubana airlines customer review,after defunct mexicana left us high and dry in havana the staff at cubana was helpful they had the next flight to cancun 5 hours after our canceled mexicana flight and told us while it was booked there would probably be room for us come back in 2 hours one and half hours later they tracked us down in another part of the airport and practically held our hand taking us from purchase to checkin however then the bad news the flight was delayed about 45 minutes before takeoff for unknown reasons forcing us to miss our united flight in cancun to denver and stranding us for two days due to a labor day crush in cancun and when i saw a wooden floor the first thing when i walked onto the plane and then the exit sign in russian i was skeptical and ive seen better overhead bins on city buses at times i thought it would be my last flight ever but the rubber bands held together and somehow the plane made it
3442,airasia x,6,changed my seat after takeoff,seoul incheon to kuala lumpur the check in counter only opened 2 hours before flight and the queue to check in was so long there were no self check in kiosk we were in the airport 5 hours before flight we were in a rush to catch up the flight as we had to take train to the gate after we boarded the aircraft and put our luggage in the compartment the aircraft was out of power due to problems with ground power unitgpu the pilot did an announcement regarding it but no estimation time given passengers were still boarding at this time with limited light and small aisle its really not worth it to pay for hot seats and having to face awful stuff but kudos to one of the cabin crew on the flight who saw me having difficulties dealing with crying babies and changed my seat after takeoff

20031,thai airways,9,90 of what they used to be kamapin,i had booked this trip as a miles trip due to expiring miles the cash tickets for these flights were quite expensive since we were rop gold members we could use the priority counter which has been relocated to row h at suvarnabhumi airport it used to be at row b check in was smooth since we were flying to japan the agent asked if we had filled out japan pass which made us clear immigration and customs really quickly in nagoya during the evening the royal orchid prestige lounge was extremely crowded however we did find a corner to ourselves far from the main food area but close to the bar halal food area which had fewer options there was more than enough food and we werent hungry when the flight took off so we could get more sleep i also used a shower suite where loccitane liquid soap and shampoo were provided boarding was an absolute mess the crew was late some passengers did not get their documents properly checked this was made worse by the fact that gate c1 had very little seating and lots of passengers ended up sitting on the floor waiting for boarding we had paid extra to get extralegroom seats about 50 usd each and they were worth it the purser suggested that i move to the empty exit row seats in the second cabin so that my mum and brother could have a bit more space and comfort this made the flight much more comfortable for them i hate short overnight flights and a departure time of 0005 wasnt great no alternatives either most of the passengers were asleep before the flight even took off but i had stayed awake to get a bloody mary from the crew who bought me one from the galley prepandemic thai airways had a policy that they would have to serve their gold frequent fliers first i am very glad that they kept this policy i was asked whether i would like omelette with sausage or shrimp pad thai i chose the shrimp pad thai which was very tasty flavourful i jokingly asked if i could get a cappuccino which is normally only available for business class passengers the fa said that she would try to get one for me which she did i asked to be woken up for the meal service 2 hours prior to landing in nagoya after some tossing and turning i was politely awoken had my breakfast placed on my tray the crew were all very nice on both flights on the return flight we flew out from sapporochitose the contract lounge in sapporo had little in the way of amenities or food boarding was much better organised on this flight and we had our meal orders taken after being seated stewed chicken with mash potatoes or spicy fish curry with rice i tasted both on this flight and both were very tasty albeit the fish used is pangas which isnt that great thai used to serve seabass which tastes much better the highlight of the meal was the cake a simple vanilla sponge but really tasty before landing we were served a spinach pie which was also tasty but i wouldve preferred chicken there was a small issue i had with the crew on this flight i found out the tray table wasnt clean when i looked at it during boarding the purser walked through told me to close it for departure but i pointed out the wet table to her she called one of the fas to wipe it up entertainment is slightly lacking they could do with a few more films thai is still a great carrier maybe not as great as the prepandemic thai airways i feel like theyre 90 of what they used to be in 2019
8616,el al israel airlines,8,did not like the entertainment,amsterdam to tel aviv we were at the airport 3 hours early but security took only a few minutes maybe because we are 71 year old americans very polite and friendly hosts did not like the entertainment which was stripped down for a brand new plane overhead movie or use your device decent legroom food was the pits seats comfortable took 2 flights both of which left late but arrived early did not like how little luggage we could bring
11991,jet airways,1,worst airline ever,london to kochi via mumbai worst airline ever never choose this airline even if you had to pay a few more extra for a decent one the connection flight to kochi was found cancelled on reaching mumbai and was offered the next days flight due in 24 hours reduced to provide accommodationlounge access they kept sending messages every week that flight number and times from london changed until the day of travel but i never expected this treatment
3201,airasia,1,i havent received any correspondence,my bangkok to phnom penh flight in october 2022 was rescheduled and i received an email notification of the change of flight time there was a 75hour change of time so i decided to cancel my ticket and receive a refund i couldnt see any option to contact a member of staff other than a bot on the airasia website since submitting my claim i havent received any correspondence from airasia luckily it was a really cheap flight and i can take the loss i certainly wouldnt book with asiaair again because i just wouldnt want to be placed in a similar situation
7622,corsair,8,corsair customer review,paris orly to montreal return the business class fare classe grand large is less than 13 of that of a regular carrier ok the seats only recline to 130 degrees but the 222 configuration of their brand new a330 is definitely better than the 232 which air france provide in their b777 excellent food and drinks wide choice of entertainment courteous friendly and efficient service who could ask for more the only slight disappointment was the badly designed footrest which does not make much of a difference all in all a very pleasant experience
22983,xiamen airlines,6,they provided a free hotel,amsterdam from taipei with 11 hours layover in xiamen they provided a free hotel accommodation for passengers with a long layover at xiamen the 737800 has a newer interior than the one i was in on my way to taipei the boeing 787 the same as the one on my way to taipei both flights were on time we had a constant turbulence on the first couple hours on the second leg of my journey so the meal service was suspended accordingly the flight attendants acted quickly as soon as we flew in a clean air again and resumed the meal service there were a significant number of babiestoddlers on the flight to amsterdam and most of them were crying and screaming constantly airlines should limit the amount of babiestoddlers on board for long haul flights simply unfair for the other 200 passengers it must also be a torture for those kids too
11915,jazeera airways,4,worst international flight,dubai to ahmadabad via kuwait the worst international flight i ever had the cabin crew didnt even welcomed us well on board my flight got delayed for 3 hours i already did web check in the morning and they call me in noon saying that my flight is canceled they were fooling me anyhow i asked to manager and got a flight 2 hours prior which led me to long layover in kuwait when i entered the flight the attendants didnt welcome us warmly as they were busy in their own work after on boarding they dont even ask for a packed water bottle for the whole flight i was hungry and even tough it was an international flight i didnt got a meal though tickets says they will offer me the floor was messy of flight and the seats were not comfortable really dint prefer or recommend anyone to fly with jazeera worst flight

16236,porter airlines,2,he was unbelievably rude,when i originally booked my flight i paid all the extra fees to ensure that i could make a change or even cancel and receive a full refund literally less than 12 hours before my flight was set to depart they did a full cancelation of the flight and expected to rebook me days later to arrive at my destination so i chose the option to cancel my flight and rebook with a different airline fast forward to 2 weeks later i still have not received the payment on my credit card so i phoned customer service tonight to inquire and the man i spoke with was the most condescending person i have interacted with in a very long time period he was unbelievably rude cut me off repeatedly and was very sarcastic in his answers when i genuinely asked questions about the airline and their performance then i find iut this whole time itd because they chose to just credit my account rather than my card which was not agreed upon when i first booked the flight thankfully they refunded me fully in the end but the phone call still somehow ended with this man being terribly rude with me for no reason whatsoever i was calm polite and friendly through the whole conversationim not sure what i did so wrong but i certainly will never make the mistake of booking with porter again
11969,jet airways,2,worst airline ever,mumbai to amsterdam worst airline ever i flight to delhi on april 6th plane was dirty old food basic no entertaiment on board what is more on the way back the flight was cancelled and i needed to wait in mumbai for two days now it is not possible to get any refund from the airline as the ticket was bought via company in europe if they ever start to operate again do not buy tickets from that airline
21226,turkish airlines,5,not chose this airline anymore,turkish airkines still does have real business class seats on european flights boarding in istanbul was a rush a non alcoholic welcome aboard drink was offered however my food in business class was sub par extremely dry chicken with some rice the wines and the alcoholic drinks were extremely basic it was an afternoon flight however fa found it appropriate to dimm the cabin lights until 15 minutes before landing i do not like to travel during daytime in a darkened cabin the fa doing the business section were extremely friendly i will not chose this airline anymore
21373,united airlines,1,fleet is old and trash,i booked this flight ua2394 months in advance selecting it because it was a non stop and a b737max they then cancel this flight at 1030pm the night before the flight on a holiday weekend leaving me without many options i had upgraded my seats to first class which i will now lose if im selected for standby more than likely not to mention its a poorer 737800 i was going for a friends wedding not only have they now ruined this wedding they try and stick me on standby on a one stop flight surely losing my first class seat without refunding my paid upgrade no doubt i dont care what they say about weather or traffic control their airlines is trash the way they treat their loyal customers is trash their fleet is old and trash their food is poor their loyalty program is terrible because they have too many 1kers you pretty much have to pay for an upgrade if you want one i finally got a flight on one of their few newer planes and they cancel it im going to get on every review site i can think and tell people to fly delta they are at least more reliable and probably have a newer fleet and may very well treat their loyalty customers better united is a greedy airline
6761,cebu pacific,1,worst ground service ever,the worst ground service ever paid for extra baggage of 20 kg apparently should be in 1 big luggage charged extra for having 2 small baggage or package it as one which is the same price will pay again going back she placed us in different seats as a family
1412,air china,5,onboard experience lacking,sydney to madrid via beijing ok for the price their website is very difficult to use their cabin staff only perfunctory and the onboard experience lacking the aircraft were reasonable with seatback screens but the movie choice was very limited and the system slow and hard to navigate especially with the oddly placed armrest controls my 777 screen stopped working entirely after 7 hours the flight attendants did not appear to be happy warm or welcoming their english was passable but their pronunciation poor so cabin announcements are difficult to understand beer is available on the drinks round but wine is only available with meals and they like to give you 13 of a cup asking for a second glass was not received well the meals were tiny taste was good but they sometimes served the same dishes twice per flight i booked a transit hotel in beijing both ways but the process was cumbersome even after i spoke to their call centre both ways it took 3 hours to get the transit visa and go through immigration and customs so be prepared the air china service desk is through customs at the door to the terminal the hotels were quite good but there was nothing nearby either of them if you have a very cheap fare and do not mind a long break mid trip in pek then air china are an option but other airlines will probably do the job better for not much more money
18085,silkair,7,service is quite good,singapore to bandung i call slikair premiumlowfare because my base is in south east asia so my choice is silkair rather than airasia for low cost the service is quite good seat comfort is standard the entertaiment is accesible on your own device and they served food too the cabin crew also nice
400,aeroitalia,2,impossible to check in online,only 1 checkin desk open for a full plane and impossible to check in online amazingly bad flight crew is friendly pilot flying into milano on april 1st did a very bad landing
21103,tunisair,3,cabin crew not friendly,istanbul to tunis with tunisair the checkin and boarding process at istanbul airport was efficient the cabin crew were not friendly and lacked courtesy the catering is average and only 1 choice of meal i will only fly again with tunisair if there is no other option
911,air astana,5,they let me down real bad,astana to paris in general air astana offers decent service quality acceptable food entertainment on the board along with fairly new aircraft despite quite often being disproportionately expensive i flew many times with them and never had problems until two days ago when they let me down real bad when in the beginning of january they started offering promotion flights to several destination in march for their loyalty card holders me and my sister decided to take advantage of it and planned our trip to paris during nauryz 3 day national holiday in kazakhstan in advance however on monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 2103 to 2303 due to spring flight schedule corrections thus completely eliminating any chance of using these holidays for a trip these types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed before offering promotions on the dates upon contacting their cs they declined to change flights or to compensate internal tickets im deeply disappointed however considering their near monopoly status in kazakhstan i fear i cannot boycott them that easily shame on you air astana for scamming your frequent fliers
12720,karthago airlines,3,karthago airlines customer review,flight to monastir they were on time outboundinbound the plane was cramped and spent the flight with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me i was in the very back row 25 on the way back though it wasnt as bad in the middle of the plane seats ripped arms broken fabric coming off bits of metal sticking out comments regarding food is true worst ever plane food found the cabin crew okay but i do speak some arabic so that helped they loved that
8660,ellinair,3,staff were friendly,flew ellinair from thessaloniki to cologne booking process and space on the plane were unacceptable staff were friendly propably the only aspect which could be reviewed as good the airline is not following european standards and is charging extreme prices for this poor service
17610,saudi arabian airlines,9,reviving and comfortable,new york to riyadh in business class id like to thank mr tarig for making my first trip with an infant as comfortable as it was mr tarig was very respectable and humble he kept checking up on us and made it so effortless for me my baby and my mother not only was he professional but also exceptionally polite and understanding thank you very much for making this trip as reviving and comfortable as it was for us
5534,belavia,8,this flight was rather nice,moscow domodedovo to minsk my previous experience with this airline was quite negative but this time there were almost nothing critical to complain on the procedure of online booking and check in was smooth and quick recently belavia introduced lowcost tariffs without checked baggage etc which allowed to make prices more reasonable ground procedures in domodedovo were rather slow but this is not an airlines fail onboard experience was great i was lucky to get modern aircraft because belavia still operates some ancient boeing 737 classic but this time it was a new b738 instead cabin crew were awesome there was even a meal service hamcheese sandwiches despite the flight is just 1h long what was rather disappointing bussing to terminal instead of jet bridge both in dme and msq maybe they have a reason for this but in both airports i saw a lot of vacant jet bridges also cabin was very cramped like in lowcost carriers possibly they are managing to cut costs in such a way i criticize belavia often for cosmic prices on european destinations for old aircraft for monopoly on flying to msq from several destinations especially european for sovietstyle of management that one can face sometimes but this particular flight was rather nice
16190,pobeda airlines,2,the flight has been missed,moscow to badenbaden during the checkin there were no separate table for baggage drop off therefore there was one queue for the people who was not registered and for the people who had been already registered we spent 40 minutes in the queue in order to leave a baggage according my opinion the number of staff from the air company who were involved in registering passengers was not sufficient at all we dropped off the baggage nearly at the end of the registration to the flight ie it means the only 15 minutes left to go through the customs and etc as a result the flight has been missed
20480,thomson airways,2,worst seat possible,thomson airways boeing 787 and the worst seat possible to have is 27c next to toilet might as well have sat in the toilet ever time passengers went to visit the toilet i was nudged with no room to get past this seat should be removed as very unsuitable flying for 10hours in a very cold cabin air con dripping above and crew using tissues to try to stop the water dripping onto passengers very disappointed with this aircraft
14653,meridiana,8,staff were pleasant and efficient,roma to olbia i hesitated about flying to olbia the ferry being another option given the poor reviews for meridiana the only company that operates a direct flight from rome to olbia in the end i decided to take the plunge on the basis that perhaps people with good experiences rarely bother to give feedback and i am glad i did the online booking was straightforward as was the webcheckin bagdrop etc ground staff and cabin staff were pleasant and efficient the plane boarded and left on time and we arrived ontime maybe even a few minutes earlier
18335,sky airline,4,online checkin did not work,lima to mendoza via santiago online checkin did not work my layover was 4 hours and 10 minutes so the airline would not check my luggage to my final destination i had to collect baggage at my layover clear customs and recheck it again was charged separate checked luggage fee for each connecting flight legroom was among the shortest i have ever seen
9471,finnair,4,they have next to no customer service,flight out from london to helsinki and then onwards to bangkok went well they are not very clear on what business light is when you book the flight but i guess easy to find out yourself and i travelled with carry on so it wasnt an issue for me connection in helsinki went fine airplane was fairly new service onboard ok food and drinks options a bit like premium economy in other airlines so nothing to write home about but it was ok now the return flight got delayed which meant i was being rebooked on another airline since then ive been trying to contact finnair about getting my airmiles for that section might sound trivial but i paid for a business class flight and those points would have come very handy in reducing my cost of future flights they have next to no customer service calling doesnt work that automated service is laughable finally after about 4 weeks i got a reply that there is nothing they can do and thats that now im thinking what if my issue was something more serious than missing airmiles i cant imagine flying with them again if there is no way to contact customer service other airlines like ba lufthansa etc arent perfect but at least you get to talk to someone and they answer your emails
4978,avianca,2,as uncomfortable as possible,after checking in at the gate on the return from guatemala avianca employees there took from us carryon water and other beverages that we had just purchased before allowing us onto the plane then the flight attendants waited an hour or so later an hour or so later to pass out beverages for purchase seems the airline is inventing security concerns just so it can squeeze an extra buck from customers while making those of us taking the flight feel as uncomfortable as possible the flight delay of an hour meant connecting flights were nearly missed message from captain made it sound like they thought they were on time
12981,korean air,2,made me dislike this airline,seoul to tokyo unprofessional and disappointing check in boarding and the beginning of the flight went smooth the seats was comfortable with plenty of leg space that was when things went downhill my friends entertainment system wasnt working and flight attendants ignore us despite us trying to get their attention food was bland and mushy the head flight attendant was rushing to get food out as she kept sighing and was rude especially to the non koreans however things started to go bad at the end of the flight the plane had already landed and was slowly making its way to the terminal when a little girl about 3 years old suddenly had to use the bathroom the mum asked one of the flight attendant if her daughter could use the bathroom the flight attendant went to ask her supervisor who was the rude head flight attendant to which she told the mum to tell her daughter to hold it the daughter was crying and kept saying how much it hurts my friend who isnt korean but understands the language translated the mum resorted to using a plastic bag for her daughter to uninate in the middle of the plane of course the little kid didnt want to so the mum desperate just took her daughter to the bathroom by this point its been 15 minutes since weve landed and was nowhere near the terminal while i understand the importance of being in your seats while the plane is moving for our safety certain protocol should be broken if there is a situation that arises the head flight attendant on this flight or at least in charge of my section made me dislike this airline which is disappointing as ive enjoyed this airline when i flew with them 10 days ago
15081,nok air,7,aircraft in very good shape,bangkok to ubon ratchathani as i started my journey from ayutthaya i took a commuter train from their station to don mueang train station which is directly located next to don mueangs international airport though with more than three hours to spare we were already allowed to drop off our bags on one of their counters our flight was operated by an aircraft that was barely just over a year old and was in a very good shape the legroom offered for a socalled lcc carrier was very generous and you did not need to fight for any space in the overhead bins the flight departed on time and complimentary water was provided to you shortly after take off before the buy on board service would start the flight took only 40 minutes and the landing performed by the pilots was excellent deboarding of the plane took only a minute or two and our luggage was already on belt before arriving to its designated belt the walk from jetbridge to drop off doesnt even take more than two minutes good job
14815,monarch airlines,1,absolutely no communication,due to high winds in manchester the plane diverted to east midlands we were to be bussed to manchester that seems to be as much as monarch were going to be responsible for no announcements were made once we got into the very depressing east midlands airport we stood around outside in dreadful weather waiting for buses absolutely no communication ok the weather no one to blame but absolutely no excuse for the abysmal lack of communication first flight with monarch dont anticipate a second east midlands airport was inundated with diverted planes because of the weather they had an unenviable job
5982,breeze airways,8,flight times are also convenient,breeze specializes in flights out of secondary markets like my home airport of richmond i would probably fly them just for the direct flights to the west being able to go directly to arizona without needing to connect is a gamechanger the flight times are also convenient as well unlike jetblue which showed its disdain for richmond by scheduling its since canceled flight from richmond to la at 9 pm breeze schedules its west coast flights so that they leave east coast midmorning and get back before its too late at night but what i really like is that upgrading to their nicest cabin with a first class seat is very reasonable maybe 100 each way the ability to fly nonstop and in comfort makes breeze a winning proposition there are some things they could do better theres no wifi or ife on the plane and the flights only run twice a week so its not always possible to use breeze if your schedule doesnt match up but i hope these are growing pains that they will resolve as they continue to grow and become more successful
12219,jetblue airways,5,they lost this customer,my review is about jet blues administrative policys i spent hours picking out the right flight that met my needs for our vacation a few weeks after booking jet blue cancels my flight and assigns me another flight this new flight the picked for me was awful i would miss a whole days vacation because my original flight landed at 10am and new flight landed at 1115 pm to my destination my return flight switched from getting me home on a sunday to a redeye arriving home on a monday just didnt fit my needs and obviously a cheaper flight than i had booked jetblue allows you one change however they had no flights nonstop going to and from my destination i called an agent to try and work things out however things went from bad to worst they would refund my money but they would only put the money in a jetblue bank that i could use one for one year i didnt think this was fair since they made the change and now i was stuck trying to make jet blue work for me i didnt want to leave money in a bank that i had to use within a year this was my money and they made the change not me i had to rebook on different days and no longer was there a non stop option they all had at least one stop and a 6 hour trip each way turned into a 10 plus hour trip just what i was trying to avoid i feel like jet blue is a bunch of thieves stealing my money and then charging me more money for an inferior flight spoke with supervisor and really worthless got the standard line of this is our policy whatever happened to treat the customer with respect and make them happy not so in this airlines i have been a loyal customer for years but lately last three trips things have been going wrong and this is the third time my flights were cancelled after taking so much time to plan jet blue needs a new business plan because they lost this customer
19647,tailwind airlines,7,staff were very friendly,brussels to antalya positively surprised okay we have been on a more recent airplane but it was certainly ok the children were well taken care of and the staff were very friendly of course there is always one grumpy one which was also the case during our flights closing off the curtain right in front of you while you want to bring your children to the toilet without any apologies not very polite the words just a second madam would already have been perfect besides this we had nice flights
8098,dragonair,3,dragonair customer review,return of the outward flight two weeks ago and just as bad very late arrival poor beverage it seems that this airline cannot fly on time i checked everyday whether this plane has flown in the last two weeks and it has only been on time once it was cheap so i guess i should expect it they also seem to find it difficult to accredit one world miles
6928,china eastern airlines,7,frequent drink rounds,shanghai to hong kong came from budapest and had a smooth transit in shanghai where i boarded the china eastern flight to hongkong on an a321 it was early morning 2nd january 2020 priority boarding at gate as sky team silver card onboard newspapers were given chinese shared monitors showed some educational movies from underwater sea world which was nice and informative texted in english food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits drinks were unlimited water tea coffee beers but only for 1 hour while the flight lasted additional 50 minutes during descend services closed down until landing that leaves passengers with very limited time of service fas were fine frequent drink rounds button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly fair legacy carrier service without pay cheap ticket better product than for most european carriers luggage transfer faultless in custody inspected by customs which left a note nothing missing full flight on time mileage rendered to skyteam account jetties availed for aircraft entering and exit what is needed is a hot meal extended time of service and individual ife
4920,avelo airlines,1,never again,avelo airlines began service out of palm springs last november i needed to travel to eugene or for business so decided i would give them a try i was scheduled to depart at 130 pm early that morning i began receiving emails from avelo advising the departure time had been delayed over the course of the day i continued to get successive emails 8 emails in all moving the departure later and later each time the flight finally departed at approximately 900 pm a total delay of 75 hours late the gate agent said she had no idea why the flight was so late and once on board the pilot only apologized for the inconvenience the delay was not due to weather so no one really knows why bottom line i gave avelo my business once but never again
16619,qatar airways,4,waiting for the driver to deliver it,the first leg from dc to doha was on the 777200er with 343 configuration in economy which is an awful set up my food was inedible but service as always was excellent i flew business class on the doha to denpasar route on a boeing 777300er it was an excellent flight even if entertainment options were limited then they informed me they failed to load my baggage in doha it was a 10 hour layover and they couldnt get my bag loaded they informed it arrived at denpasar hours later and said they were waiting for the driver to deliver it and then nothing it is 8 hours later and no update or response no luggage
3825,alaska airlines,2,they kept switching gates,the management is not at all good seat assignment is always messed up they made me wait till the last minute for the seat assignment also they kept switching gates which was very confusing
16863,royal air maroc,9,actually a great experience,overall the experience wasnt bad party of 3 adults actually booked on 2 separate reservations check in at miami was easy we did the 24 hr layover to experience casablanca which was the whole reason we chose the airline we had confusion initially on if we would get our bags in cmn the third person in our party had a late connection into miami and her luggage said it was checked to cmn ours was checked to bcn however her bag did not show up in cmn staff was nice and willing to help but their customer service was what i found to be typical for the country just lacking by american standards plane was clean food was good the flight itself was actually a great experience better than most us airlines
20977,tui airways,5,dull as dishwater b757,larnaca to manchester i recently enjoyed a holiday with my family group of 7 consisting of 4 adults and 3 children the first point is with regard to the online checkin service on the outward flight my wife and i have always checked in via the normal procedure at the check in desk my daughter preferred the online method to my mind our use of the unfamiliar touch screen procedure seemed no quicker than letting an experienced checkin desk assistant carry out the task one of my daughters cases was found to be 25kg over the modest 15kg allowance there is every chance that a person may waive this minor indiscretion but the online system is totally abitrary culminating in a 45 surcharge this was later waived by a tui assistant to be fair moving onto the flight itself there were no issues of note other than being on a dull as dishwater boeing 757 very basic the week long holiday at tofinis hotel near ayia napa was great enjoyed the food etc no probs on the return flight we found it to be delayed just prior to the return transfer 2 hours on a late night flight but no major issues these things happen however it was common knowledge amongst the passengers due to internet checks but on arrival the tui rep chose not to mention it i sort of understand that because why would anyone make themselves the focal point of peoples frustration if you dont have to onto the flight and again we found ourselves on the rather tired looking 757 i suspect tui are suffering due to the grounding of the 737 max of which they were the biggest customers and i understand the companys predicament the flight was adequate and on landing at manchester we found the airport was disorganised due in part to procedural disruption arising from the ongoing terminal expansion we were held on the plane and kept informed over the tannoy by a clearly irritated member of the cabin crew who informed us that we needed to be bused from the tarmac to terminal and the airport hadnt been expecting us half an hour later we were disembarking and the journey was complete the following day i felt as rough as sandpaper cold symptoms and a sore throat i cannot conclusivly put this down to the plane journey but it is known that changes in air pressure can cause physiological effects like toothache and joint pain having taken trips on the uber modern tui dreamliners with their humidified cabin air i had forgotten just how rough an old plane could leave you feeling i hope for tuis sake that their fleet problems can be resolved sooner rather than later
10969,hi fly,2,cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything,we returned from holguin on flight 5k2817 run by hifly this company was drafted in to replace the original thomas cook flight mt2817 the flight was due to take off at 1700 but we didnt start boarding until nearly 1700 like most people we didnt rush as we had boarding passes with allocated seat numbers some people had also paid more for extra leg room seats as we boarded the plane the cabin crew told us to just sit anywhere this led to chaos and contributed to the delays in taking off a storm then rolled in and at 1755 the captain confirmed that we wouldnt be taking off there was no further information until 1839 when he announced that there a was sick child on board and asked for assistance at 1908 a thomas cookcondor plane landed in the storm at 1931 the captain announced that the child and parents would be leaving the plane but it wasnt until 1958 that the baggage belt arrived to start removing the bags at 2046 the captain announced that we would finally be leaving at 2050 the thomas cook plane took off ahead of us at 2121 we finally took off 45 hours after boarding the cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything not even the seating we heard of several fights breaking out and there could well have been many more the seats were cramped and there was no leg room the selfish person in front of me pushed their seat back resulting in absolutely no leg room at all my knees were crushed against the back of their seat for over 8 hours there is no way i could have placed myself into the brace position see image i pointed this out to the cabin crew who as usual couldnt care less there was no entertainment at all and the only food offered was a roll with very little inside it the only drink offered by the crew was water however we discovered 6 hours into the flight that hot drinks were available near the back none of the crew bothered to tell us and we had to get up and get it ourselves this is without doubt the worst flight were have ever had to endure the whole experience had left us reluctant to fly again hifly should not be used as a replacement service again they simply arent up to the standards required for even basic air travel their planes are cramped underequipped and the staff are either undertrained or just couldnt give a damn
150,aegean airlines,1,lost my luggage 3 days ago,lost my luggage 3 days ago no call from aegean or airport holiday ruined we had to rebuy all our clothes again as they made us check in even our cabin luggage

19394,sunwing airlines,4,knew what to expect with a budget flight,we have flown sunwing before so knew what to expect with a budget flighthotel package to huatulco from vancouver i opt for the premium seats paying an extra 50 each way which gives a bit of legroom in the bulkhead and to be near the washroom but be warned that if you have an aisle seat you will be constantly jostled by people using the facilities if you get a window seat you have to climb over your seat mates and hope they are nice people who dont get annoyed at you stepping on toes banging knees or doing some creative choreography to not end up in their laps facing them and then you have to go through the tiny galley where the flight attendants are scrambling with meal and drink service lets face it this is a flying sardine tin and changing in the tiny closet of a bathroom in or out of weatherappropriate clothing requires the skills of houdini my husband quipped not enough room to change your mind let alone clothes on this trip home we had to drop off passengers in victoria before a very quick flight to our final destination vancouver 11oo pm 100 am huatulco time when landed the passenger count was off for some reason and had to be recounted about 4 times flight attendant was snarky when i asked if a resolution was being worked out and that she didnt have an answer and i should take my seat we missed our takeoff slot during this mishap so what should have been an expedient unloading of victoria passengers and very quick flight home landed us in our airport hotel about 200 am 4 am huatulco time not terrible in comparison to other delays im reading about with this airline they need a major improvement on their menu and execution of said menu my husband was sitting across from the child from hell and his parents this kid had screamed his way through the airport prior to boarding and they wound up on our flight my sympathy for the parents dissolved when a passenger and the dad almost came to blows before the flight attendant intervened later upon take off and landing dad refused to buckle the 4 yr old into his seat and got into an argument with the flight attendant who technically could have thrown them off the plane and wish she would have the kid calmed down for the most part for the rest of the flight however when we were delayed in victoria my husband moved up to sit with me and chat when he returned to his seat the child was sitting in it the child had smeared gum under my husbands shoe and it was ground into the carpet no doubt under the watchful blind eye of his parents i realized in the end that the flight attendants patience had been wearing thin all along and bear her no ill will i also realized that the crews start to christmas day wasnt ideal either then our luggage was delayed my conclusions 1 flying during the busy holiday season can be less than perfect things that cause delays are somewhat mysterious to us civilians and may be based on facts that we arent privy toalthough they could keep us better informed 2 wider aisles and wider seats are desirable but if you buy a bargain package dont expect luxury 3 passenger behaviour and personal foulups may also be the cause of delays
11287,iberia express,2,penny pinching rip off,madrid to manchester with iberia express and paid 350 euros one way to have a little extra space and a simple hot meal usually provided on this route the meal has been substituted now with snacks such as olives in a sealed bag and a powder cup soup but they have the nerve to display a soup bowl on their brochure iberia has become a penny pinching rip off
7837,csa czech airlines,7,friendly and nice cabin crews,my flight copenhagen prague on 9th may 2017 everything was perfect onboard the aircraft comfortable seats friendly and nice cabin crews the only problem was waiting for security control in copenhagen it is not the fault of csa czech airlines and secondly was that the flightdeck crew departed before even the safety demonstration video had not finished
20303,thai smile airways,5,afraid missing next flight,it is more like lcc free luggage small snack given allow to select seats after blocking many seats saw it all vacant finally why self service to get water no serving delay saw history of operation delay every day unable to plan with 2 hours transit afraid missing next flight ask me to get the luggage at my final destination but pass immigration when i transit but luggage arrived international side so we had to walk to another terminal to get our luggage
11381,icelandair,4,i will never fly icelandair again,on our return flight from london we laid over in at keflavik airport we learned when we arrived that we could not return to our departure airport newark instead we were diverted to new york and had to find our own way back to our car before our 3 hour drive home the airline has agreed to reimburse our uber fee since they created a disturbance in our travel plans however while on the flight to new york seated in row 2 of first class a couple in front of us had a small and very old dog about an hour before landing the woman was telling the man to hurry and get up because the dog had to pee she then carried to dog to the service area and told the flight attendant the problem the attendant gave the woman an extra blanket the woman returned to the seat put the blanket on the seatput the dog on the seat until it relieved itself then she returned to blanket to the flight attendant the blanket was not waterproof or absorbent enough to keep the urine from running down the seat to the floor where of course my personal bag was stored when i retrieved it my purse was covered with dog urine and half the contents were also wet i advised the attendant on my way out and she simply said oh thats not good thats it the smell was awful and i had to carry that bag without any offer to help clean it or bag itnothing i will never fly icelandair again given this wholly unacceptable animal policy i have no problem with small animals traveling in the cabin as long as there are proper and sanitary provisions for their normal bodily functions the flights were otherwise clean and comfortable and staff was attentive wifi stinks
22916,xiamen airlines,9,the seats are comfortable,xiamen to amsterdam the flight attendants are kind willing to assist with cabin luggage the english they speak is okay the seats are comfortable and stuff like long socks blankets earphones and pillows are offered most of the time i fly solo with xiamen airlines but this june when i flew with my partner german nationality they offered great help both by email and at the airport for my partners 144 hours transit visa free the food and beverages onboard is good for breakfast and dinner they have at least two options between chinese and western food the dishes taste good and the portion is big during late night they offer sandwiches and hand out some warm towels or tea before landing breakfast is offered the content of movies is a bit limiting for hollywood movies but theres a big collection of chinesejapanese and korean series and films
13909,lion air,5,seats were not very well spaced out,the flight from berau to jakarta was in two parts we flew from berau to balikpapan on a atr 72500 of wings air which was quite comfortable since i got a first row seat and was thankfully on time since there is nothing to do at berau airport the check in process was smooth and hassle free the balikpapan to jakarta leg was delayed almost 2 hours thankfully i had planned a long gap before international connection to mumbai to singapore the lion air leg of the flight was relatively less comfortable and the seats were not very well spaced out so i would say it was ok but would definitely would not plan a flight with lion air if time is critical
20415,thomson airways,4,crammed in like sardines,gatwick to sal cape verde crammed in like sardines not sure how thomson get away with this space between seats is so limited you cannot get out without hanging on to seat in front so you annoy your fellow passenger seats also recline so if you are unfortunate enough to have someone in front recline you are effectively a prisoner in your seat i am 6 tall and my knees were touching seat in front in upright position extra leg room seats not purchased in advance very expensive hence availability were offered for 30 each these were snapped up quickly but looked like they were taken by larger passengers no entertainment food surprisingly tasty no choice crew seemed happy on arrival thomas cook airbus was on tarmac very jealous will not do this route with thomson again unless they use different plane
14909,myanmar airways,8,myanmar airways customer review,ygnpnh via rep flight was almost full meal service on ygnrep sector decent meal and drinks service no ife but the mingalabar magazine was interesting enough transit in rep was fine straight through to the international departure hall which has a range of shops and internet access second leg much shorter although a drinks run was provided lounge access at ygn 8 is total worth the cost flights on time crew friendly
4857,austrian airlines,3,causing me to miss my last flight,i booked my flight three month in advance my flight got delayed for two hours causing me to miss my last flight to the final destination both flights were austrian airlines i received a hotel voucher but this does not change the fact that i missed a very important day they rebooked me automatically and in the end i have to take two more flights
19279,sun country airlines,2,lack of efficiency lack of response lack of resources to aid customers,supposed to return to dfw on july 1 2021 they told us it was delayed no problem we get there the sy staff informs us its cancelled and if we need a hotel we declined and asked our next steps they told us to just go home and wait for an email and said they were unable to book flights mildly frustrating i understand flights get cancelled but the staff essentially told us to just go home and wait for someone to reach out to us which still hasnt happened in over 14 hours been on hold with sy for over an hour put my number into the call back list over 8 hours ago and havent received any call back extremely frustrating we receive an email saying well get a voucher for a new flight within 10 business days absolutely unacceptable a couple of extra days sure maybe 10 business days stranded is just plain wrong no other phone number works so i went back to the airport to get some additional information all of the staff left no sy agent anywhere in the airport as of right now we are stuck at our current destination with no idea of when we can return to dfw as we havent heard anything and cannot get a hold of anyone to help us with our issue the unprofessionalism lack of efficiency lack of response and lack of resources to aid customers is disappointing i can say with confidence i will never fly with this airline again ive had other flights cancelled with american and other airlines and they handled it with haste and professionalism i have seen neither here
511,aeromexico,4,wasted money for a flexible ticket,when i purchased flights for an additional fee i was offered a more flexible option for changing flight dates i took the inbound flight then thought to return a week later than planned when i tried to use it the change fee was more than the round ticket itself i went to the airline website and purchading an oneway ticket was even cheaper than changing the date in my case i wasted money for a flexible ticket
10982,hi fly,2,terrible experience never again,los angeles to london gatwick terrible experience never again originally booked with norwegian but received text message stating our flight was being operated by hi fly we had the economy plus allowing us to check bags seats were pre assigned and meals included no overhead air vents and the flight was extremely warm the seats are small in flight entertainment was the movie titanic the meals were served late to everyone which is good for them but why did we pay extra the beverages are warm ice not available if you would like to purchase additional snacks or beverages they dont offer this service the staff is not friendly were speaking portuguese the whole time i would have never booked this airline dont do it i give them two stars because the pilot did a great job of us arriving safely

11032,hong kong airlines,6,surprisingly nice and attentive,auckland to hong kong flight was quite expensive but i had to book it last minute and no other options were available as this was the christmasnew year period i arrived well intime for checkin at auckland airport scheduled departure was 1015 am and i arrived just before 8 am online checkin was not available for this flight no reason given only two counters opened for checkin at the airport for hong kong airlines there was already a long queue for what it looked like was a very full flight and the line was getting longer behind me as well checkin process took awfully long the three ground staff were slow rude and unapologetic i was still waiting for my turn at the scheduled boarding time of 930 am they had to rush the last 20 or so passengers for checkin and rudely told us to run to the gate or well miss the flight no priority was given at security and no airport carts were used to transport us to the gate i doublechecked both at checkin and at boardinggate with staff to ensure both my checkin bags were on the flight considering the checkin was hectic i was assured both times that my bags were on the plane we finally made it onto the aircraft and departed almost 30 minutes late plane and seats were old but nevertheless comfortable i had a window seat at the back of the plane curtains and interior were a warm red colour cabincrew were surprisingly nice and attentive leg room was sufficient and i managed to get an empty seat next to me food was delicious toilets clean and the helpyourselfminibar at the back of the plane made the difference ife was mediocre not a lot of choice but sufficient arrived in hong kong 20 minutes ahead of schedule i went to the transfer desk in hong kong airport to make my jet airways connecting flight here they advised me and some of my fellow passengers that due to late checkin at auckland out bags werent loaded onto the aircraft and they will be coming on the next flight after i arrived at mumbai it took 5 days for them to deliver the bag to my mumbai address after countless calls and emails overall not a bad flight but they need a more efficient checkin process to ensure all passengers that arrived on time are checkedin on time by the ground staff and ready to board at least before the schedule boarding time
4507,arik air,7,arik air customer review,i recently flew business class from london to lagos and then on to asaba i hadnt previously heard of arik usually preferring ba however the arik price was more than half the ba price and also had the guaranteed connections from lagos the business class product is impressive the beds are better than ba and the cabin feels a lot more spacious including a bar where you can go to sit the cabin crew were also very friendly the internal flights were both delayed because of the weather this was dealt with well by the arik staff though the inflight entertainment is not too good and the customer service is not quite up to the ba virgin standard i was still impressed with arik and would certainly fly with them again

6465,caribbean airlines,2,caribbean airlines customer review,bw 903 on 09072014 from london gatwick to trinidad i usually have a good experience when flying with caribbean airlines however the bw903 had a couple of unprofessional flight attendants they were rude had no sympathy for passengers with children this together with a generally poor service made it a difficult flight

17011,royal brunei airlines,4,wouldnt travel this airline again,this flight was sold to us as one stop however there were in fact 2 stops london heathrow to bandar seri begawan stopping in dubai and we later connected to bali this should have been sold as 2 stops as it is misleading to say its one and very wrong we wouldnt have bought this flight if we had known brunei bwn airport has nothing in it we had an 11 hour stop over which was torture there are no restaurants or bars in the departures lounge and the whole airport smells of urine partly due to the revolting toilets onboard the flights the evening meals were tasty choice of chicken or beef chicken lasagne stir fry ginger beef chicken chausseur beef biriyani lunch was a disgusting and sour lemon chicken wrap that repeated on you breakfast was disgusting chicken sausage or beef sausage with a vile baked egg style thing due to being an airline based in a muslim country this is a dry airline and all food is halal a 2 minute long prayer is said before each take off which is quite in your face for people that dont follow islam seats are reasonably comfy ok leg room in flight entertainment was good quite recent films the cabin crew were very attentive and polite i wouldnt travel with this airline again
23153,zipair,5,insist i paid for another 23kg of luggage,twenty years in the film distribution business and never once has an airline refused to allow me to hand carry movie posters in a tube until my first flight with zipair from nrtsin on nov 4th 2022 they said my poster tube exceeded the dimensions of their overhead compartment they insist that i paid for another 23kg of checkin luggage when my checkin luggage was 195kg of 23kg and my hand carry was only 45kg of 7kg it was very clear that they did not want to listen to my explanation that my luggage was under weight and the poster tube weighed under 2kg they kept saying that it is company policy the flight was less than 20 occupied a very empty flight the overhead compartment would have easily contained my poster tube with plenty of space to spare poster paper measures 27inch width and 39inch height rolled into a poster tube cardboard 2 inches longer than the posters width the cabin crew were unsmiling patrolling the aisles like the police i found them annoying as they made their presence felt too much and gave out that i am watching you feeling and its not like they were giving out water you have to pay for it my prepaid inflight meal was not bad the expensive wagyu beef bowl is available and they seemed to have stopped selling their normal beef bowlminus points here purchased a can of suntory premium beer and pringles paid with a credit card but had to type in my details on their tablet prices were reasonable but i had to selftype all the cc details etc for it to happen cash is not accepted for inflight sales otherwise the flight was smooth cabin was clean hardly any pax less rigidity and friendly cabin crew may improve business keep your current attitude and scoot will benefit most with their flexibility and surprisingly professional and charming cabin crew on my sinnrt flight on the same trip both flight tix were bought using the airline official website

18579,smartwings,2,service and attitude appalling,im quite a frequent flyer and my flight with smartwings from gatwick to prague was one of the worst one ive ever experienced the overall service and attitude was just appalling they fly old and dirty aircraft with very limited leg room but what is even worse is their customer service on my last flight from london me and other two people were late for our baggage checkin by approx 15 minutes due to industrial action on uk railways the smartwings representative were notified by the front desk however they wouldnt make any effort to check in our bags even though the boarding hadnt finished and we would still make it in time for our departure we all had to pay for new flight tickets for the following morning
1961,air italy,5,air dolomiti worked okay for us,munich to bologna and pisa to munich both on an embraer 195 economy both flights handled efficiently southbound on time northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight there had been thick fog at muc early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning however support given to those with tight connections modest inflight service snacks and drinks wine came in proper glasses air dolomiti worked okay for us
4758,aurigny air,7,aurigny air customer review,gatwick guernsey return atr72 clean and tidy both legs on time seat pitch tight if you are tall but acceptable for 45 minute flights complimentary soft drink cabin crew working fast to complete full service in tight time constraints overall a good regional carrier but with one irritating gripe there is a 3 fee to choose your seat in advance this under the current climate is not too bad however if you book a fully flexible ticket and subsequently change your flight although there is obviously no fee for changing your flight you will be expected to pay the 3 again if you want to choose a seat on the new flight if you are on a flexible ticket you should really only have to pay the fee for choosing a seat once
18715,south african airways,8,really impressive service,east london to london via johannesburg really impressive service on saa to deal with a late departure on a domestic flight by an hour with an already tight connection onto a long haul flight from johannesburg on boarding and making the cabin crew aware of my concern they smiled and reassured that i would make it no problem this was confirmed when the captain announced during his pretakeoff message that he was aware of a passenger connecting to london and some others onto munich that he had alerted this to the ground staff in johannesburg and that there would be staff waiting at the gate on arrival to whisk us through to the connecting flights exactly that happened it was a pleasure to see everything work as promised and took the stress out of a worrying situation saa must be commended somehow despite their near bankruptcy but that is another story for offering generous food and alcohol giving two bottles of wine instead of one two liqueur miniatures etc on their flights a notable contrast to their two competitors virgin and ba on this route where cost cutting is so obvious cooked breakfast and three dinner options still offered and flight attendants that enjoy their jobs and want to serve their customers only gripe was on boarding on the return at lhr five people were struggling to locate their seats a family had been split up across the totally full plane and no staff were present or visible to assist they all were in the galley before takeoff chatting and when i went back to let them know if someone could assist they looked irritated small blemish though on 4 very good flights my luggage on the return was not on the belt in johannesburg after a worrying 15 minutes the baggage enquiries desk confirmed it had mistakenly been transferred onto my next flight and it was there at my final destination keep in up saa

14291,lynx air,2,avoid this airline,total nightmare booked flights for a round trip from toronto to st johns not worth the savings the level of stress of having to deal with their ridiculous level of unreliability is just too much they tell you to be there at least a couple hours early and then delay your flight by at least a few hours we were at the airport at 5 am for a 720 am flight and didnt take off until 1020 am theyll keep you having to check for delays constantly because theyll just keep furthering an original delay and then have you sit on the tarmac for ages the way back from st johns to toronto was unbelievably even worse a two and a half hour delay and an additional hour and a half sitting on the tarmac in toronto just waiting for our gate to be available with very little communication from staff until people started getting angry made for a harrowing 7 hour ordeal all for what was supposed to be a quick 3 hour flight could have flown to europe by then avoid this airline its just not worth it
17364,s7 siberia airlines,6,seats were comfortable,aerdme with s7 siberia airlines mobile checkin was quick and efficient the aircraft was quite old but the seats were comfortable and had decent legroom the chicken sandwich was tasty and sufficient for a 2 hour flight cabin crew were efficient though not very friendly overall a decent flight for a good price
6201,brussels airlines,1,a horrible experience,my first time with brussels airlines was a horrible experience i was travelling from bristol to budapest via brussels in the early morning today everything was fine until i landed in brussels i had good one hour to go through security and passport check but it did not turn out to be enough to get there without having to rush with my huge backpack apparently there was only one security lane open only 20 people could go through the check within 30 minutes some people were extremely stressed out as it was their final call and they were only about to move on to passport check where there were only two gates open at the time getting through passport check required another 20 minutes my luggage had to go through the scan 3 diffetent times during security check in brussels the otherwise very friendly gentleman in charge took the time to explain how the cheese and the cocoa powder in my backpack looked exactly like liquids on the screen he also told me there is generally no way to distinguish liquids from powder and cheese in the system without physically unpacking the entire luggage at this point please let me fundamentally question the technical efficiency of the security scanning at brussels airport i managed to get through the security and passport checks all of them so then i had to rush through the entire airport to get to my connection where i could somehow manage to arrive 1 minute before the gate closed i boarded to soon learn there were no more room left for my luggage in the luggage sacks i even had to go and ask the utterly careless stewardess for assistance who advised me to put all my belongings under the seat in front of me including my luggage of 55x40x23 cm size my coat and small bag come on now brussels airlines is there no place for everyones hand luggage on a plane anyway there will be no next time for me because i will avoid travelling with brussels airlines in the future it has been a terrible stressful and uncomfortable first experience i usually pick economy class and know what to expect for that price but never in my life have i experienced such discomfort during a flight the assistance the management and the technical background were all lousy meaning the company has failed to provide all important aspects of customer service

7086,china southern airlines,8,calmed me down with excellent service,first leg of the flight sha can was cancelled within 24 hours before the departure from shanghai to los angeles via guangzhou but somehow i made it in time from shanghai to guangzhou by taking an earlier flight to catch my long haul flight from guangzhou to los angeles on may 15 2021 though it was not a smooth trip due to the unexpected sudden flight cancellation but luckily i was impressed during this trip with the ground staff of china southern airlines at guangzhou international airport who checked in me and calmed me down with excellent service

15659,openskies,8,openskies customer review,value for money this was one of the best airline experiences ive had check in on both sides was fine the premium plus with an equivalent fair to most airlines economy comfort was a far better value definitely more room and more comfortable seating than comparable airlines offerings while their fleet of 757s are not new and not glamorous it was better than most international business class of 5 to 10 years ago considering you only pay a couple of hundred dollars more then a regular coach sardine class and 23000 less in business class it is hard to beat this airline also the fact that fly to orly as opposed to charles de gaulle makes transportation into the center of paris much more economic
15996,philippine airlines,1,how disappointed i am,i cant tell you how disappointed i am with philippine airlines and upset with the service on january 10 we received the message that our flight vnz38n was rescheduled in this message from philippines airlines says that if you do not want to accept this you can contact the service i contacted them through whats app on january 26 and the support team assisted me on my request i specifically asked if i can cancel the tickets for my husband and for me and get a full refund he checked twice and confirmed that we would be refunded the full amount for both flights on 26 january i then received an email from philippines airlines for my husband and me that i should contact the service again because more information is needed from us i contacted the service again via whats app on feb 2 i had to explain everything from the beginning again and was in chat for over two and a half hours i explained that the service advisor confirmed to me on 2601 that the full amount for both flights will be refunded and i showed the screenshot with this confirmation they unfortunately could not help me at all 150 minutes in the chat took me a lot of time and nerves and nothing came out of it i filed a complaint on february 1 for my husband and for me at email protected with our reference numbers on february 2 a service representative called me from 18004359725 he said that he cant provide me the full name we talked on the phone for 20 minutes he got approval by his manager to refund our full amount as confirmed already by sergio on jan 26th in whats app chat he understood that based on sergios confirmation we cancelled the two flight tickets through philippines airlines and booked a new flight with another airline because there was no flight from philippine airlines which fits in our time schedule with the other flights we did this based on the statement that we would be refunded the full amount for these two flights he therefore spoke with his manager and received clearance for the full refund to us he told me that he will give this info to the back office and that back office will then email me the confirmation for the full refund for the canceled tickets to date i have not received an email now that ive spoken to three service people from philippine airlines wrote several times emails invested so much time and have to start all over again im very upset
11435,insel air,1,delays were not communicated,curacao to bonaire with insel air original flight time 910 am 930 am we chose it so we could get enough sleep and still be at our destination early enough to go scuba diving that day 2 days prior to departure we were informed by email that our departure time was changed to an earlier hour ie to 715 am since insel air asks you to be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure we got up at 430 am in the morning there was no request to confirm that you had received said email as soon as we arrived at the gate in the airport we were informed that the flight was delayed from 715 am to 845 am we were quite annoyed because that meant we could have just as well slept long enough after waiting for an hour we were informed that the new departure time was now 0940 am we were also informed that the 0715 flight was cancelled and everybody was simply booked onto the next regular flight everybody got an 8 snack voucher until then the communication at the gate had been relatively professional every delay was displayed on the gate monitor from now on however no more communication departure gate was changed from gate 2 to 6 but until departure it was never shown on the gate monitors we had to follow the crowd to find our new gate all additional delays were not communicated in any way at 0945 am still no boarding when we asked at the gate we were informed that there was an additional delay and departure time was now scheduled for 1015 am at 1015 am we were not boarded boarding finally started at 1020 am departure around 1040 am arrival around 1100 am on the plane we were told that all seat reservations were cancelled and that everybody should just sit down wherever they wanted we were lucky to be early so we could still find 2 adjacent seats after arrival at bonaire airport we were shocked to learn that there had been no luggage at all loaded into the plane insel air somehow managed to fly about 100 passengers but left all of their luggage in curacao there was now a long queue in front of the lost baggage counter when we were up our boarding pass number was written down on a piece of paper nothing more when we asked about the further proceedings we were informed that the luggage could not be brought to our hotel instead we would have to come back to the airport and pick it up they could not tell us at what time that would be possible and only after repeatedly asking they wrote down our phone number and promised to call us when the luggage was there to pick up they never called after not hearing anything from insel air we drove to the airport at 1500 pm and luckily it was there

16340,qantas airways,5,rang for service three times with no response,service was okay on the first plane but on the a380 it was nonexistent i rang for service three times with no response after an hour l got up and went to the stewards section where two stewards were sitting and ask for a drink the response was a hand appeared from behind the curtain with a drink in the hand and no sorry the food trolley had one steward handing out meals and drinks it took her ages to get to the rear section is this the standard for economy now l am a pensioner and cannot afford premium if i ever fly again l will think twice about qantas or the a380

20470,thomson airways,8,crew were businesslike,flew thomson manchester to paphos return in april flight left on time leg room slightly limited i am 5ft 9 cockpit announcements informative and the crew were businesslike but friendly enough i did feel sorry for the two crew members who had to deal with two parents and three children mid way down the cabin all of the children appeared to be under 5 they began causing havoc in the departure area and were rather a nightmare throughout the flight thankfully we were 4 rows back i pitied those immediately behind as there was simply no escape from the constant shouting screaming and general disruption fully appreciate that young families are entitled to a holiday as are the rest of us i have travelled frequently with young children and have always struggled to ensure that they did not disrupt fellow passengers the parents in this case simply had no control whatsoever over their children who were unruly and vocal continuously through a 45 hour flight the mothers response to their constant screaming was to shout back to their credit the cabin crew did intervene at an early stage even before the aircraft left the ground to ensure that dad who apparently planned to sit apart from his partner and the children for the duration of the journey took charge of one of the children this didnt make a huge difference but probably slightly eased the journey for those behind this was basically all that the crew could do but they did at least intervene and attempt some improvement without causing offence flight back a week later was on time and no complaints clear up of the cabin prior to landing could have been a bit more thorough but not a huge problem the most tense part of the return journey was nervously scanning the departure lounge hoping that the family from the outbound flight were not joining us on our return leg they didnt result
6955,china eastern airlines,3,wheel chair assistance not provided,delhi to brisbane via shanghai the requested wheel chair assistance was not provided in new delhi airport in shanghai airport we got wheel chair after a long wait the wheel chair assistant was highly impolite and very very rude person cant expect someone like him working at an international airport where people from different nationalities commute at the time of boarding at shanghai airport it was raining heavily and staircase to the aircraft was uncovered causing the passengers to get wet
18809,southwest airlines,2,i was not pleased at all,my flight was originally a total of 4hr 25 mins and we were rescheduled one night prior and informed that we would not only be leaving earlier but a 6hr layover was added in another city with no explanation given this turned out trip into a 10 hour trip this inconvenienced my family greatly also i traveled with military personnel who is family my entire trip and had no issues anywhere else except for when staff at gate 41 refused to allow us back with our group we traveled as a group of 4 he scanned 2 of our passes and refused to scan the other 2 and sent us to the end of the line ultimately separating us and causing issues with our seating this staff was not pleasant and did not allow our military personnel guest use her benefits properly even after we already spent 6 hours in the uso after once again being inconvenienced this was my first time flying with southwest airlines and i was not pleased at all i am not sure ill be back

5557,belavia,1,belavia customer review,flight from warsaw to minsk was on time and uneventful transit at minsk was impossible because the airport has no facilities to process transit passengers all passengers with connecting flights were herded into a hot stuffy room for an hour until the man in a green uniform who had the key to the door to the main minsk terminal decided to appear by that time most connecting flights had departed including my flight to kiev belavia staff tried hard spoke little english said i would have to sleep in the airport as my passport was ineligible for a transit visa on arrival and travel on the morning flight to kyiv 14 hours later nothing offered not even a bottle of water for the inconvenience to be fair it was the fact that minsk airport does not work for transit passengers that was the issue but belavia must be aware of this and should not sell connecting flights i am sure belavia is fine for point to point travel but it and minsk airport is unable to cope with connecting flights
2915,air tahiti nui,2,recommend avoiding air tahiti nui,i would recommend avoiding air tahiti nui our outbound flight from the us was uneventful the plane however was in poor shape with threadbare carpet outdated seatback entertainment some flights dont even have screens sagging seatback pockets and below average food and service the flight was ontime though and we were headed to paradise so we could overlook these minor issues even though the flight cost even for an economy ticket was at a premium price point on our return trip is where we ran into serious issues there was a mechanical delay on our flight which postponed our departure for 24 hours we waited in line for 3 hours before we had the delay and rebooking information however and were told that there was no possibility of being moved to one of the three other pptlax flights that air tahiti nui had before our rescheduled flight left they put us up in a nice hotel overnight so we werent too upset at spending another day in papeete we had booked all of our ongoing flights out of lax on our own due to my wife and i parting ways after the trip and her complicated international travel upon getting to the hotel i began the process of rebooking all of those flights as we were given the new departure information the following night after breakfast the following morning we were feeling pretty good about everything when i just happened to check the air tahiti nui website to see if our flight was still on time nope we were delayed another 9 hours which then caused us to miss all of our rebooked connections from lax we did not receive any notification from the airline about this additional delay at this point air tahiti nui really let us down they did not rebook us on any of the other departing flights for lax they had no consideration for connecting flights in order for my wife to make her destination in time we had to reroute her on another air tahiti nui flight to tokyonarita they would not apply any of the funds we used for the pptlax flight nor would they simply book her on that flight at no cost due to the mechanical issue when we spoke to customer service we had to find all of our own solutions due to their incompetence and lack of understanding to top it all off they were completely indifferent and unapologetic to this day almost one month later we have not been engaged by their customer service department for reparations after repeated emails and phone calls based on our experience i would recommend a few things there are other carriers that fly tofrom tahiti air france hawaiian air etc look into them and see if they are an option for you take a vacation somewhere else there are a lot of nice spots in the world and while tahiti is exotic and amazing our poor air travel and all that followed totally clouded our experience if you still decide to go and to go with air tahiti nui try to book all of your air travel through them on one ticket or if you are booking your own connections be sure to have some flexibility on your us arrival a day or two in la on the back end
1046,air berlin,3,cabin crew was unfriendly,abu dhabi to berlin the cabin crew in our section was unfriendly when asked for milk for my coffee she just waved it never said a word no smiles no response in english i had the person next to me translate nobody looked at passengers when we entered the plane the crew talked to each other and we were just not greeted with a smile like all other companies i have flown with i had to make this review as it was not a good atmosphere i felt really uncomfortable and it was quite a long flight
14165,lufthansa,6,worst in flight experience,i have been a loyal customer of lufthansa both for economy and business flights for over 16 years being my second preference after swiss flying longhaul with them for the first time after the pandemic how things have changed it was the worst in flight experience the hardest seats one can possibly imagine for an 11h flight terrible food and in the smallest quantities no snacks no fruit for in between and the entertainment console i could not even imagine something this terrible can exist in 2023 it was touch screen but mostly an instrument of torture for your fingers and the slowest thing one can imagine not too great of a selection either paid internet available obviously their safety record is great and i am happy they got me to my destination safe and on time but it would have been nice if they did it with a bit more comfort i am really disappointed to see what was a really great airline to fall so low in terms of service

14781,monarch airlines,8,pleasantly surprised by the legroom,flew monarch airlines from manchester to porto pleasantly surprised booked an extra legroom seat outbound and was pleasantly surprised by the legroom inbound however was a standard seat and was tight to say the least 510 tall i would certainly opt for extra legroom on future bookings service although buy on board was courteous and efficient and the food quality was actually fine it puts the budget airline british airways to shame being able to pay cash was a bonus outbound was running around an hour late and i received an email from monarch whilst in the airport to say rescheduled which was a nice touch inbound was just as efficient and arrival in manchester was on time overall i would book again providing the flight schedules are suitable
3054,air transat,4,aircraft did not offer a bassinet,i had a very hard time getting in touch with customer service over an hour wait i originally spoke with an agent before booking who confirmed the availability of seats with extra leg space as i was travelling with 2 kids by myself of course after paying and booking the air transat agent said there were only 2 seats available and i had to let go two agents were giving me conflicting information and i asked to speak with a manager they said you will have to wait an unknown amount of time which can be a few hours it was also disappointing that a aircraft with a long flight to europe did not offer a bassinet they claim the seats are bigger in this new aircraft but i did not feel that was the case i also tried to modify our return booking i wasnt able to do so via the app or website i kept on getting an error message and had to call customer service and wait for more than an hour i travel a lot and this is by far the worst airline service never to be repeated

11036,hong kong airlines,4,brought my wife and i one blanket,i caught a redeye flight from bali to taipei via hong kong i had to ask four flight attendants over a period of 10 to 15 minutes before i received a blanket one flight attendant brought my wife and i one blanket but we clearly asked for two we held up two fingers when we requested the blankets she later gave two blankets to a couple several rows in front of us i had to ask another flight attendant the fourth to get a blanket most people use a blanket on redeye flights so i cant see why they were not stowed in the seat pockets as i have experienced with other airlines
17201,rwandair,4,disaster for night flights,flew on a narrowbody b737800 at midnight on 2 march 2019 from kigali to dubai direct flight in contrast to fly opposite direction this aircraft has no lie flat seats which is a disaster for night flights i purchased the ticket in faith of their refurbished a330 but they made an equipment change obviously due to low load checkin online is a joke and waste of time after filling some 7 pages with info online they eventually laconically inform that checkin must be done in airport worst landed in t2 in dubai which is a messy lcc terminal and fought my way to t1 for onward flights homepage misleading and systematically hide info on booking class even their most expensive bisticket give only few miles which furthermore only can be used on rwandair lounge in kigali is fine but they have blindfolded all windows with tape to deprive passengers any view of tarmac which is painful embarasing and a misunderstood security issue luggage checked in to next destination only thus had to fight again in dubai for further luggage transfers these 6 issues deprives rating 6 points of 10 leaving us with a poor score of 4 on the brighter side is the nice atmosphere onboard great traditional rwandan decorated interior in business cabin fas were great and well caring champagne and welcome drinks provided menu cards and drink lists provided sparse supply eg only one kind of beer and only two dishes offered for supper only 2 options the food was only passable but plenty breakfast of poor quality punctual airline with stunning tall statured fas however their flight equipment is limited and they are not attached to any airline alliance thus miles earning is only for their dream miles program which is very stingy with miles even for full fare business tickets will chose kenya airways and ethiopian in future despite detours over nbo or add as they are considerably cheaper and mostly have a better product
14476,malaysia airlines,6,never use malaysia airlines again,first and worst experience of my life i had connected flight with them and their flight delayed for 4 hours which resulted in passengers missing their next flight pathetic response from staff no responsibility taken no apologies my next flight was 24 hours later i could not get accommodation in the airport i could not go out as immigration would not let me one day visa i have to spent full day with my infant son and i paid for all other costs because the flight wont take responsibility i am still in the airport spending the night here and paying the cost for the mistake that airline did would never use malaysia airlines again
9453,finnair,3,food for long haul is extremely disappointing,i flew a350 from singapore to helsinki with finnair the aircraft is new and spacious for economy but food for long haul is extremely disappointing drinks after the first one you must pay for in a long haul flight is unheard of from a national flag airline breakfast is another huge disappointment no snacks service is kept to minimum entertainment is out of date program for a national flag airline it is the worst i have seen even worse than ba economy class i would never fly finnair again unless there is a gun pointed towards me rather choose other national flag and they are all a similar price
21860,virgin australia,7,hasnt credited my miles,good flight and good crew there was nothing special on this flight but it was just a short flight while the seat was ok for such a short flight the aircraft should get an update though unfortunately virgin australia still after 5 months hasnt credited my miles to my qatar account and is ignoring my emails to customer service strangely virgina australia doesnt allow people living outside of australia to open a velocity account that made me wonder if they just dont appreciate business with tourists
22902,wow air,4,seats were incredibly cramped,berlin to chicago via keflavik a pretty good airline that tries to be stylish and relatable to customers the biggest problem everyone had with this airline is that they dont provide water on the flight even if it is 7 hours long you ask for water they say you must buy a bottle for 3 euros seats were also incredibly cramped and uncomfortable there are thankfully charging ports onboard so you can use your tablet
20812,transaero airlines,8,transaero airlines customer review,new york jfk to moscow surprisingly cheap tickets and good service in economy the crew spoke good english and were courteous both meal services were quite nice taking into account free wine selection teacoffee and icecream service in the middle of the flight looked like a compensation for the nonexistent ife program on the overhead projectors and monitors was only in russian
2378,air moldova,5,air moldova customer review,after a 3 day delay my replacement flight was still late departing and arriving in flight meal was a sandwich cheese and salami no options a small alcoholic drink and good range of juices and teacoffee seating was cramped made worse than ryanair as seats recline it then depends on how considerate passengers are in front of you
10499,go first,3,frequent cancellation,the worst flight experience ever pathetic service frequent cancellation long waiting hour for connecting my too and fro both got cancelled at last moment even after booking prior to a month as per the tag line you are first i doubt any time that we are first apart from being economical rest nothing assured if you are travelling for any important work keep two days additional else you are expected to get delayed for sure
20241,thai smile airways,7,the taste of the snack was too bad,almost all things are good except the snack or light meals in flight the taste of the snack was too bad other services in flight were good ground staff and flight attendants are kind with a warm welcome to all customer
10232,garuda indonesia,6,legroom was great,bangkok to jakarta the booking process with their website was a nightmare attempt to put my ke frequent flyer number were rejected choosing special meal was hard the food serve for an evening flight was a lunch portion however tasted pretty good bangkok check in queue took hours and arrival was confusing even at their best hub at cgk terminal 3 the cabin interior was overdue for an upgrade however legroom was great
21531,usbangla airlines,7,staff were good,dhaka to bangkok good service though it made delay while departing very good food staff were good price was a bit high when i purchased no entertainment screen on board
342,aeroflot russian airlines,6,smiling and attentive cabin crew,moscow to helsinki with aeroflot relatively good flight waiting for checkin took 15min then it was very fast flight on time relatively comfortable seats legroom decent smiling and attentive cabin crew negative point the snack served on board was a sandwich with beef with no other alternatives airlines should make an effort to at least offer two options meat non meat
14719,meridiana,9,meridiana customer review,having had a great outbound flight and reviewed it as such i was a bit apprehensive about our return flight from florence to gatwick nothing to worry about as it was also fine left on time arrived at gatwick a few minutes early efficient check in at florence airport and friendly service on board only comment is that we had paid for extra legroom seats by the emergency exit and mine was by the window and it is a different design from the others in the row and was uncomfortable fortunately we were able to move to other seats in the same row across the aisle so i would suggest you avoid a window seat by emergency exit maybe we were just very lucky
6049,british airways,4,wifi didnt work,you can buy sandwiches and crisps but dont expect a hot meal because the plane is a narrow body there are no screens not helping matters is the fact that the ba prebooking shop for food didnt recognise the flight number and the onboard wifi didnt work
11109,horizon air,4,very poor customer service,my flight from calgary was delayed due to a mechanical error i had a connection to anchorage that i barely made due to the delay my disappointment was that i had paid for a premium seat and they gave it away to someone else they gave me a middle seat and told me i would have to call to get reimbursed for a credit that is very poor customer service heads up the premium seats have more leg room but sit 3 across and are narrow the inflight movie app did not work on my iphone 6s nor did it work on my brand new lap top i would avoid this airline in the future
14397,malawian airlines,2,my seat was filthy uncleaned,johannesburg to lilongwe was originally booked on sa170 but due to their strike i was rebooked onto malawian airlines et21 the whole process was a total mess boarding gate staff pulled aside 5 or 6 passengers because they did not scan passports at the checkin counters made us wait until the entire flight was boarded and then scanned us and boarded us after that i was seated in 1c business class my seat was filthy uncleaned and plastic parts of the seat were broken and cracked the tray table for food was broken and sat at an angle with the food tray sitting on the edges delicately and precariously hostess did not seem bothered about this and still place food and drink on the wobbly table which was frightening food was abundant it was very tasty and enjoyable could not fault it aircraft information card was fool of dried food obviously not cleaned for ages will never want to be on this aircraft again if i had a choice
22448,volotea,9,very good flight,very good flight cabin crew were very attentioned priority boarding was a good advantage we can follow this flight with volotea wifi on board
17412,s7 siberia airlines,4,s7 siberia airlines customer review,domedovochelyabinsk return first time with s7 all fights on time on all legs very smart aircraft clean and comfortable lots of leg room in economy courteous staff though not much english food excellent
21945,virgin australia,6,the staff were pleasant,unfortunately the flight was delayed by 40 minutes otherwise i enjoyed the flight the staff were pleasant and well organised and apart from the late departure it was a good flight
22992,xiamen airlines,3,premium price for no class airline,kuala lumpur to fuzhou with xiamen airlines and paid premium price for no class airline delays on outward and return flight food was quite poor and served in paper boxes same menu there and back and same lack of taste inflight entertainment was nonexistant and the cabin crew were rushed and at times sounded like giving orders seats were not comfortable and not much different from many low cost carriers departure at fuzhou was a mess and almost every bag needed to be manually checked you would imagine that the counter staff could speed things up by giving advice on chinas special baggage rules note do not pack your powerbank and certain electrical items in your luggage
19712,tam airlines,2,tam airlines customer review,grueze jj8000 airbus a330200 i always flew tam and they always provided a decent service and acceptable coach class seat comfort but the last time they were able to transform a 25 hours flight in a nightmare it was an early morning flight and my seat was 35k the interesting thing is i had flown in the very same seat in the very same plane ptmvp one year earlier from gru to mia and it was a pleasant flight but this time they refurbished the interior and had shrunk the space between coach seats i couldnt find a nice position to relax myself even it being a 25 hours flight the catering was ridiculous just a very small cold tasteless ham and cheese sandwich a lot worse than they use to serve on sao paulorio de janeiro shuttle service the flight attendant told me it was an early morning flight and called that stuff breakfast and told me the food in night flights on that route was a lot better i took the night flight to come back and they gave the same small cold and tasteless sandwich for the price they put in the ticket it should be a lot better coach class used to be good but lately its a nightmare not only at tam but on all airlines i have flown
20728,tigerair australia,2,lived up to its reputation for unreliable service,coolangatta to melbourne tigerair is the most disorganised organisation i have dealt with my travel agent calls me following a notification they received 24 hours before my departure that my flight departure is no longer 335 pm but is 605 pm because of car hire i have to return to the airport at 330 pm or incur additional fees i check tigerair website on the morning of my departure and it says i am departing at the original time of 335pm confused i call a tigerair consultant you again tells me the departure time is 335 pm after checking the company website when i query that and tell them of the alert i had received about my flight being delayed the consultant makes a deeper investigation and then confirms the update is correct the departure time is 605 pm the fact the consultants depend on a website that is not properly maintained to give accurate information to travellers is maddening tigerair has lived up to its reputation for unreliable service and i will not be flying with them again
367,aeroflot russian airlines,8,very good service,lisbon to moscow i was excited to try aeroflot but had read some concerning reviews this flight proved that aeroflot offers very good service we could choose from three options for breakfast and trust me it was delicious the aircraft was just fine and the seats comfortable the staff are nice but could chill and smile just a little more or maybe it is my approach to service also if i check in online having to wait on a long queue at the airport just to drop off doesnt make much sense nowadays the same goes for not having the boarding pass on the wallet but having to have it printed
20453,thomson airways,6,extra leg room not worth the extra,gatwick to cancun return i dont enjoy flying so my husband booked the extra leg room on the boeing 787 for this 10 hour flight service was good with free drinks we only had soft drinks and hot food i settled down to watch a film with the screen some 18 away from my face perfect within an hour or so the passenger in front reclined their seat screen now 12 away and totalally restricted the extra area that we had paid for not happy the other comment that i would make was that when the tray was opened for use the back of the chair in front behind the tray was filthy it had what looked like splashes of tea all over it we did report this to the air hostess on the return journey generally though service food toilets all good acceptable cleanliness and extra leg room seats if passenger reclines their seat not worth the extra money
22777,wizz air,8,toilet should be cleaned better,flawless flight there was a slight delay because runway was busy but we still made it only 25 minutes behind schedule the toilet should be cleaned better during the flight
9578,flair airlines,4,very disappointed,very disappointed trying to get home to a family emergency but all three of us have to pay 160 dollars just to change our time whats the point in having insurance if you cant use it for emergencies
10392,germanwings,4,germanwings customer review,cgn to ham airbus 320 booked economy class i checked in early and my checked bag was a little overweight it had 24 kg since i booked my ticket via lufthansa where i have a 23kg bag free staff made me take out one kilo out at the desk and i had a piece of hand luggage again since i had originally put my hand luggage into my checked bag as i did not want to have it with my on the flight flight was ok crew were nice only downturn was the nitpicking at the checkin
22980,xiamen airlines,8,roundtrip ticket only 350 euro,booked a xiamen airlines roundtrip ticket from amsterdam to jakarta via xiamen for only 350 euro everything was great i loved the meal the staff were very helpful the seat was comfortable and i had a good sleep during the flight the entertainment was proper but some movies have no subtittle the flight had no wifi connection
6350,canadian north,6,canadian north customer review,i fly this airline regularly between yellowknife and edmonton staff is generally friendly and the complimentary food service is a nice touch but generally inedible unfortunately they have the tendency to change your seats without notice and you will not find out until checkin time much of the reason for this change is that if they notice a flight is only half booked they use half of the plane for cargo which eliminates the first 6 rows of seats thus when booking on canadian north make sure you book the back row of seats between 1016 and you likely wont have to worry about your seat being changed prepare to be packed in like sardines on most canadian north flights though seat pitchwidth is standard
10106,frontier airlines,1,garbage with a capital g,garbage with a capital g actually make it all capital letters and bolded i always want to give airlines a chance and this is my 2nd time with frontier and once again it reminded me why i shouldnt fly this airline they delayed my flight twice and claimed that my pocket on my small purse was touching their bin where they measure bags so they charged me 100 this ridiculous if you can afford a better airline or maybe save a bit more for a different airline then do it i have been so stressed out with this airline that i literally have a migraine they claim that your bag needs to be a certain measurement but what they really mean is make sure your bag slides in the bin and theres plenty of room around without even letting the slightest piece of your luggage touch the bin i hate this airline
17002,royal brunei airlines,9,delightful experience overall,melbourne to ho chi minh ccty via bandarseri bagawan delightful experience overall checking in was quick and easy with express passes for departure lounge access at cathay pacific lounge in melbourne and pass for the lounge in brunei we were permitted 40kg which apparently can be spread over multiple bags boarding was confusing as they call up families and business at once so you are in a line boarding as many families were travelling it seemed our seat on the plane was very spacious but we couldnt have any bags stowed near us all had to be put in the locker we were offered juiceswater prior to take off menus were distributed and the staff during this first leg were fabulous very friendly they referred to us by name the entertainment selection was very good the food was superb the steak ordered was very tender and the quantity of food ensured we were well and truly satisfied yet there were snacks available also we had to go through security again to board our next flight the flight from bandar seri bagawan was on a smaller plane and it was late arriving thus late leaving the staff were not as friendly on this section but we still got fed a sizeable main meal all in all it was a positive experience and one i would love to do again
19498,swoop,1,why pay for a seat,my experience with this airline has not been good first off they cancelled my flight but agreed to move the date to another day and lucky for me i was flexible i paid for my seats both ways and when i checked in the seat i paid for was correct and was listed on my boarding pass 2f when i got to the gate and i went to board she said that was not my seat and they had no more window seats im like how can that be she had no answer i was super angry because why pay for a seat when they just give it away
6571,cathay dragon,4,high priced budget airline,hong kong to changsha return outward flight left on time and arrived slightly early plane was very clean snack was to say the least minimal pack of 4 cookies bottle of water small chocolate i had to ask for coffee for a 4000hkd ticket i would have expected more return leg we all boarded early and could have left early however we sat for 45 minutes before an announcement was made of a technical issue it was sorted but left 30 mins late and was late into hong kong more info could have been given and we all could have stayed in the terminal food identical the airline is not cathay it is still a high priced budget airline no in flight entertainment unless you have already downloaded the app
10996,hong kong airlines,8,quality airport and inflight service,this is definitely one of the underrated airlines quality airport and inflight service for quite a reasonable price check in and boarding were smooth the pilot has maintained adequate communication with us and the cabin crews were very attentive and helpful the food was not superb but beyond average the cabin crews kept checking us from time to time to see if we need anything else which i asked one of the cabin crews for a refill for my cup and she was gladly to do so seats are average for its class inflight entertainment was great a good selection of shows to choose from for less than a 3 hour flight if you want to get the most bang for your buck i think you can put hong kong airline into the list
1505,air dolomiti,8,air dolomiti worked ok for us,munich to bologna and pisa to munich both on an embraer 195 economy both flights handled efficiently southbound on time northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight there had been thick fog at muc early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning however support given to those with tight connections modest inflight service snacks and drinks wine came in proper glasses other reviewers seem to have had a hard time but air dolomiti worked ok for us
5810,blue1,5,blue1 customer review,fly blue1 twice a year from stockholm arlanda to vassa the other reviews are right about the plane noise it is pretty loud with a prop plane but the fact that it was 2x1 plus the seats were blue leather and larger than normal than made up for it
16304,porter airlines,3,over 44 for my baggage fee,toronto to montreal they have completely changed over the last five years i will never use them again they rip you off on your baggage fee if you dont book it online however they dont tell you that when you arrive at the airport you cannot book your baggage charge on a separate booking station you have to wait for over one hour to speak to an airline associate i had to wait over one hour in the line up because their was only one person serving hundreds of people flying out yesterday then when i got to the line up she charged me over 44 for my baggage fee on the way down i flew with westjet who charged me 30 on top of everything else i had to ask this associate four times to give me a receipt and to return my photo id they use to be the best airline use air canada or west jet in the future
10462,go first,1,delayed or cancelled frequently,never travel via this airline first is there for namesake only where as their flights are delayed or cancelled frequently our flight was scheduled at 915 pm on 26th april which was delayed by 45 minutes then they announced people to be in queue for boarding after waiting for long they informed that it is further delayed by 40 minutes then after 40 minutes they had no clue weather it is departing or not it is then scheduled for 300 am next day passengers with small children on wheelchairs suffered a lot in pune airport there is no lounge facilities boarding area became like a railway station no one was able to answer people were left on their own
3615,airbaltic,1,9 hrs on a overcrowded airport,baku to amsterdam via riga with airbaltic the flights were supposedly 6 hrs total it was 17 hrs no explanation rude staff at transfer riga they shoved me off with 2 vouchers for 2 coffee i waited 9 hrs on a overcrowded airport no lounge seat during first flight they were assuring me the connecting flight would wait not so they did not even offer water or some food as consolation handed in my claim according to eu regulation 2612004 airbaltic is accountable and should pay for my loss of time i missed out on a meeting on top of it no response whatsoever so now i have to hand in my claim to get this case settled
22018,vistara,9,onboard experience for these short flights is top notch,goa to bombay in an a320neo in business class vitaras onboard experience for these short flights is top notch good seats good service good snacks my one complaint is the choice of music in flight india is a land with a great musical tradition and instead of featuring an indian music selection vistara for some reason has decided to go with bad western music also when is vistara going to provide inflight wifi
16544,qatar airways,1,flights always on time,thank you qatar airways due to the nature of employment i fly on regularly with long distance flights since 2000 during 2020 with the covid outbreak my then carrier of choice stopped flights to and from johannesburg south africa qatar airways was the first airline that resumed flights from south africa and by times the flights were less than 10 full but qatar kept on flying and that bought my loyalty in addition to the above why do i continue with qatar airways flights always on time very important for me ground and flight personnel professional and friendly doha transit very quick and efficient even with numerous flights disembarking providing socks eye masks and toothpaste kits for even economy class food and drinks served of good quality and lastly flight schedules work out perfect for me
7138,citilink,1,took me 50 minutes to check in,jakarta to penang i made a booking through the website and paid however the confirmation email i received says my status is on hold they never sent me another email with further updates till the day i flew on my flight date i arrived at the airport and the tv where they display the checkin counters says citilink counter 3348 i queued and waited for my turn then the staff took 1 minute to check my details and issue my boarding pass however she soon realized her mistake and tore my boarding pass she told me to walk to the international counters at gate 8090 i noticed that i was on seat 18f i got there and noticed there were 3 queues 2 for penang 955 am 1 for kl all 3 queues were not that long and it took me 50 minutes to check in because the staff serving my counter took a long time to check in a family of 10 i get that it is a big group but 50 minutes both the penang queues werent moving my flight was at 955 am and at 905 am i was still queuing behind the same family eventually at 910 am penang passengers started jumping queues because it was so slow they didnt have an automatic ticket kiosk to check in passengers without bags by the time she was done i had to run to my gate there was still a line to pass through immigration i was on seat 30f because i was one of the last to check in again the flight was similar to other a320 flights around the region
5482,batik air,7,flight attendant are nice,surabaya to makassar finally a flight for home and i choose this airline great ground staff clean cabin the flight attendant are nice crowded flight great take off and good landing no delay

4449,ana all nippon airways,8,overall its good flight,jakarta to tokyo flight is nice but theres a lack information about what kind of food that they serve a confusion regarding beef pork so it wasnt easy for me as religious one mostly i ordered kosher meal from website but this time i choose to search manual by menu and a knowledge by the staff was minus overall its good flight
21744,vietnam airlines,9,satisfied with the food,this is my third time flying between hanoi and paris with vietnam airlines using premium economy checkin was very fast thanks to sky priority premium economy guests have sky priority benefit during checkin boarding and baggage claim the staff at the counter was really responsible she instructed me all what i need to do as i need to transfer in paris nothing to complain here clearing the border control and security check was slow as the airport was overcrowded and no sky priority this time the seat was very comfortable and convenient even though it could not be made like a flatbed it was enough for me to sleep well legroom was very very generous as this should not be a problem for this class the seat was just 45cm wide a little bit small two meals were served on this 12hour flight i chose to have a seafood meal even though i do not have any problems with any kinds of food in general i was satisfied with both the quantity and the quality of the food the things i love most is the huge diversity of drinks lots of soft drinks juice milk and even wines were offered however extra nonmeal food was bad as stated in the menu instant noodles and sandwiches could be ordered at all time but i failed to order sandwiches as for inflight entertainment since i am vietnamese i really enjoy their programs and i found that vietnam airlines really try their best to put the newest and hottest movies on their entertainment however another issue happened with the headphone the inflight headphones were very old they have been used for quite lots of years also in my seat the headphone could not be strictly plugged into the socket which was really annoying flight attendants are helpful and friendly but i found that they were really tired announcements were well played in three languages vietnamese english and french this time i think that they spoke really well in general i think vietnam airlines managed to satisfy all the requirements for a longhaul flight they also succeeded to make it worth paying extra for premium economy however in order to be 5star they need to improve a lot on the facilities food as well as inflight entertainment
12983,korean air,9,flying korean air next time,i recently flew brisbane to london via seoul with my family and we were put up overnight in the grand hyatt at seoul incheon airport very nice i was impressed with the whole package legroom food service we will be flying with korean air next time we jet off

18473,skywest airlines,8,big thank you to staff,a big thank you to staff of skywest airlines at st george airport and on flight dl7393 wednesday may 18 2016 my age related reduced mobility and endurance makes travel more difficult than in past years and i had dreaded this flight however skywest staff made it one of the easiest flights i have had in years of travel the male attendant in the boarding lounge saw my cane and luggage and without my asking came to me and asked if i would like help which i accepted gratefully on boarding the female flight attendant also immediately took my luggage and placed it for me on deplaning a male staff member offered to handle my luggage and proceeded to get me through the arrival lounge and to a wheel chair where i was taken all the way to the outside taxi stand given that the skywest lounge at slc airport is far removed from the baggage claim and taxi stand this was more than just a convenience i was able to arrive home without being exhausted kudos to the above mentioned skywest staff a team of champions
4973,avianca,2,sub charges for carry on luggage,this is a terrible company to fly with when you purchase a ticket you are no advise to upgrade anything but you get hit with sub charges for carry on luggage i would not use this company avianca for any reason any longer
12276,jetblue airways,2,they refused to let me board,i googled extensively and was flying to see a friend in barbados who said no entry requirements and that you will fill out the form once you land in barbados 30 minutes before my flight leaves i get called to the boarding desk to show the entry form and barcode which i of course did not have i tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working it is not required beforehand and this was from an official immigration officer at barbados im not angry at the people at the boarding desk because i do understand they were doing their job but they refused to let me board the plane until i had this particular document which i could not get at all because the site is not working a nice manager walked out and had to get on a computer for 20 minutes and by so miracle got it handled so i could board the plane i was livid and so upset that i was not going to be allowed to board my plane over something that is not even necessary truly the immigration officer at barbados thought the whole thing was ridiculous and everyone else on the plane coming from the us was able to fill out their form at customs they thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the san jose airportjet blue demanded i have that and almost denied me getting on that plane the first plane ride was 4 hours and a red eye and absolute hell they kept the lights on the entire time and the flight attendants kept coming up and down the aisle hitting me with elbowtray at least 20 times they were angry 40 minutes before landing they start screaming at everyone to wake up and the person next to me in the middle seat had her seat back and was sound asleep with her hood over her eyes a flight attendant walked up and stood over me to forcibly yank her seat back yank her hood off and tell her towake up they then just glared at me to remove the bag off my lap while we still had 30 minutes to land on my next flight to barbados no one asked for this stupid entry form when i was boarding which i thought was super comical i was in a middle seat and when i sat down there was stuff in the aisle seat but no one around flight attendants kept asking me over and over whose stuff it was and im like dont know finally a sweet older lady comes up with a cane and says everybody calm down i was at the back of the plane allowing everyone to come though because its really hard for me to get up and down come to find out the poor lady had a knee injury flight attendants were so rude to her i had been flying for over 12 hours and was extremely thirsty and kept getting such attitude when i asked for water i asked one male attendant who never brought it to me when i asked the female attendant a second time for more water in my water bottle and a sparkling water she rolls her eyes and fills up my water bottle halfway and doesnt give me a sparkling water and just walks away
10476,go first,2,last airline one should opt for,flight was 4 hours late started at midnight staff very curt and unfriendly towards irate passengers due to the delay go first is the last airline one should opt for across all sectors they keep rescheduling the flight
8971,etihad airways,1,cabin crew are so rude,i will never be flying with this airline again and i encourage anyone to stay away from them the cabin crew are so rude on all four of our flights i certainly do not recommend flying with them with a young baby the treatment we got was disgusting not only were the cabin rude and not helpful at all hardly anything worked on the flight out tv was broken and half the toilets which was great for a 14 hr flight should be ashamed of yourselves and the way your cabin crew behave pressed the buzzer so many times and nobody even came
16234,porter airlines,2,been nothing but chaos,this airline is a mess i called days prior to our flight to ask questions about baggage and what was allowed and what wasnt i was warned to expect to lose our baggage we arrived to the airport on the day of and everything seemed to go smoothly all the staff on the flight and the flight itself was exceptional however when we arrived to our destination one of our bags were lost 2 days later it arrived we were told we would be called but no one called they just delivered it to the address we provided at the airport on our return flight everything went smoothly at the airport and in the flight again all the flight attendants and the flight itself was great however was delayed slightly when arriving to our home destination we picked up out bags and car seat noticed slight damage to one of the bags and the car seat for my child unfortunately we didnt do a thorough check at the airport our car was waiting and we were in a hurry as our flight was delayed by 40 minutes when i went to put the car seat in the car the car seat was all taken apart i had to take the time to secure it and put it back together in order to use it then when we got home we noticed the other bag was all ripped at the pocket ive tried getting in contact with them and no one answers the phone no one seems to know anything about anything literally its been nothing but chaos their customer service is atrocious outside of the flight itself
6224,buddha air,1,disgusting and unprofessional,biratnagar to kathmandu i waited for 5 hours just to be notified that my flight was cancelled i arrived airport at 1600 to catch my 1725 hrs flight we kept on asking if our flight was ready they told us our flight was being held but surely we would fly at 1800 hrs but it was around 2100 hrs after boarding they told us our flight was cancelled as the pilot told his time was up disgusting and unprofessional
4685,asky airlines,1,issue with my hand luggage,johannesburg to lagos i flew with virgin from sydney to perth then south african airlines to johannesburg was there a few days and finally asky to lagos i had been coming with the same baggage from sydney asky had an issue with my hand luggage stating its too big and there was no space for it on board i agreed to check it in with my other luggage only to get to lagos and not find my luggage the only response i got from their customer service was that its a daily flight we will bring it tomorrow no apology meanwhile i dont live in lagos so i had spend extra time and money plus stress to sort out accommodation for that night
12799,kenya airways,1,it was a bad experience,it was a bad experience i had a flight from entebbe to nairobi and from nairobi to amsterdam i missed the first one and went straight to nairobi seemed that they canceled the whole flight i had to go to sales and they without explaining any detail told me i had to pay 475 dollars for a new flight as i had no time at all i had to make a quick decision but after i tried to ask for answers but i did not get any good explanation beside that i had to pay the difference bad customer service and lousy way to dealing with people
9053,eurowings,5,i wont complain,short hop on this airline belonging to the lufthansa group basically not really worse than flying with many european airlines who claim to be premium letting you anyway pay for food drinks seats luggage etc so i wont complain eurowings is a low cost airline crew was joyful and cabin presented well even if the seat pitch at the back of the plane isnt great pay for food is reasonably priced and the crew handled the process efficiently love eurowings boarding concept two groups priority with those having booked a fare including a larger cabin luggage and normal boarding for those with standard hand luggage
1283,air canada rouge,7,good value for money,we were on holiday visiting both toronto and las vegas its not often you get to fly on a 767 in europe anymore and i was looking forward to this trip on one even though i know they are showing their age the airport in toronto was efficient and relatively quiet and it was good that we could do the us immigration preclearance there boarding was quite fast given the number of people but after we boarded the cabin crew had to work very hard to find hold space for all of the carryon bags which led to frustrated passengers and the plane was uncomfortably hot while all this was going on the 767 did look old and a bit tatty but actually my seat was comfortably and i nodded off and before long we were in vegas i thought the flight was good value for money given the distance we were covering nearly 2000 miles i think baggage arrived quickly in vegas airport too
22545,vueling airlines,5,everything was fine,i approached this flight with skepticism since i have had bad experiences with vueling in the past but apart from little leg space everything was fine the flight was on time drinks and food for purchase average for low budget carriers and staff were nice and attentive so will consider them perhaps again in the future
11395,icelandair,4,would not fly icelandair ever again,if i had any other option i would not fly icelandair ever again in march they cancelled my flight from gatwick to keflavik less than a week before the fly date rebooked me on another flight which was then cancelled again 3 days before the departure even after i contacted their customer service to make sure that it will not be cancelled they told me that it will 100 not be cancelled cause theyre trying to bring all the natives home because of covid im icelandic so was reassured by this which was a huge mistake i ended up buying a last minute flight with easyjet to get home to my family so overall it cost me between 1k15k with the many train tickets i had to buy cause they kept cancelling and the last minute flight didnt get my refund until september and that was after i contacted the ceo directly during summer and easter i kept calling their customer service which just told me that im in a queue to get a refund complete bollocks since people who got their flights cancelled in julyaugust were getting their refunds while i was still waiting from march now i need to get back to the uk since my university is starting again icelandair is the only airline flying between uk and iceland that doesnt have any connections in different countries right now so i had no chocie to book with them again my flight was supposed to be this saturday and i just received an email from them that it was cancelled 2 days before departure they rebooked me for sunday but i wouldnt be surprised at all if i got an email from them tomorrow or on sat that that flight will be cancelled as well not to mention i already booked the train tickets and the hotel for saturday and changing that to sunday cost me yet again a lot of money and i had to call my student accommodation and let them now of the change in plans as well if you have any other option then icelandair even if its more expensive choose it
11356,icelandair,2,one of my worst airline experiences,this was one of my worst airline experiences after delaying my flight out of lgw by 4 hours and being promised by customer service agents that it would not be a problem and they would figure out an easy solution for me when i arrived in kef they delayed my connection but not enough for me to make my flight there were only a couple other flights going to the us the rest of the night that were already overbooked because they had done the same thing to another flight that day my only option was to be put in a hotel and take a flight 24 hours later after finally arriving to the hotel i was supposed to stay in the hotel informed us that they had run out of rooms and would transport us to a separate hotel not one icelandair employee apologized or admitted that maybe they should not have reassured me many times that everything would be fine and i would be able to continue on to my final destination
4193,american airlines,8,polite and friendly,flew to dfw from vancouver one way after attending a wedding no delays on inbound flight the flight was smooth with very little turbulence encountered kudos to american airlines flight crew they were polite and friendly premium economy seat had enough legroom for a comfortable flight service is typical biscotti snack and soft drinks of all domestic flights american does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic and trans border flights
9154,eva air,5,a comfortable ride,it was a comfortable ride the seats are not bad you get what you pay for cabin crews are helpful food quality is alright about the same as pre pandemic inflight entertainment is mediocre with a limited selections of movies and shows still its worth flying with eva air if you are planning to fly taiwan
7393,condor airlines,2,i will never book them again,when i had to exchange my ticket for later date and my new ticket was 250 cheaper condor did not give me a credit or refund for airfare they kept that amount and they still charged me 160 exchange fee i had to exchange my ticket twice due to family issue and the 1st time they charged me 130 but the 2nd time 160 so whats their exchange fee really they do not have a set policy on fees and other things then their customer service rep booked my new ticket for 1 week earlier it was his mistake he was careless and didnt care about the customer overall i ended up canceling their ticket they kept the ticket price amount i will never book them again
17534,sata air azores,9,flight was uneventful,santa maria to ponta delgada my first inter island flight boarding went well staff were nice the flight was uneventful taking only 20 minutes i would advise to ensure that flight magazines are well kept and not torn apart
18558,smartwings,2,rudest service experienced,dubrovnik to amsterdam via prague first flight was delayed by approx 1 hour so we had to run at prg airport to catch our connecting flight connection time was too short for the luggage which arrived two days later in amsterdam no apologies or helpful information at all by smartwings staff rudest service i have ever experienced
17281,ryanair,6,15 euro fare no complaints,uneventful flight no delays ryanair crew were friendly enough by ryanair standards window seat so not too uncomfortable usual multiple sales pitches squeezed into a 45 minute flight ryanair are never going to win any awards for service or comfort but thats not their intention considering the 15 euro fare no complaints
17981,sichuan airlines,4,something isnt right,chengdu to taipei i actually heard myself say out loud well into the flight that i will never fly this airline again i fly a lot sometimes the service is great sometimes not so great sometimes the food is actually good sometimes its just barely edible and i dont really care and i never complain but there was something about the rudeness the abruptness of the staff that just annoyed me i felt singled out as a westerner their english wasnt the best which for an airline is unusual but i speak some mandarin so i can get around that and and usually chinese seem to appreciate that not so this lot the food was awful some kind of rancid pork fat suffusing the rice i have a return flight today which i would lose the money on and i am at least this time mentally prepared i certainly wont be getting on hungry nor will i be expecting a relaxing glass of wine and a smile from the girls are they actually trained like this something isnt right
8441,edelweiss air,5,edelweiss air customer review,phuket to zurich a330300 the outbound flight on time and aircraft clean and confortable good breakfast and hot lunch with perfect service the cabin crew were friendly and very efficient nice snack before landing in zurich ice cream during movie and countless passes with the drink trolley very good airline
2940,air tahiti nui,5,air tahiti nui customer review,the seats were so uncomfortable i was dreading the flight home there was no lumbar support and the add on headrest pushed my head forward putting my neck at a very unnatural position i could not get comfortable using pillows and blankets or in any position it made for a very long flight home
11274,iberia express,4,not a comfortable experience,gran canaria to madrid from start to finish i felt like there was so many problems firstly i arrived at the airport early so i didnt have to leave my baggage in the hold however everyone who was priority was allowed on before they put people into groups so i was group 3 the last even though i was the first near the gate after that my luggage was put into hold once on the flight the staff seemed disconnected and also flustered themselves i suppose because things dont run smooth the back of my seat was broken so i had to be transferred next to a mother and small baby crying at this point i just wanted to rest the food and drinks were overpriced and i had to pay 250 for a tea which was that bad i had to ask for it to be changed the hot water was not warm enough to brew the tea so it ended up looking like dirty dishes water at the other end of the flight i waited over 20 mins to get off the plane and then a further half an hour to get my bag which was only very small not a comfortable experience in total and wouldnt think of flying again with them easyjet is a much better option for low cost
15534,omni air international,9,staff and service were excellent,ramstein air force base germany to baltimorewashington flew as spacea on the amc usaf patriot express or informally freedom bird seats were narrow as would expect for transporting physically fit soldiers but adequate legroom departure delayed for two hours for technical reasons but better safe than sorry since flight over atlantic ocean precludes any emergency diversion and landing all seatback electronics functioned cabin staff and service were excellent supper from germany not us was to european standards quite good not the untasty us airline food and had a real breakfast not a snack as on the inadequate other charter company outbound crew was attentive gracious and always helpful overall much better than usflagged carriers and up to european standards although flew as military retired at minimal cost i would be pleased to pay fullprice ticket for the service rendered on this flight
5117,azerbaijan airlines,9,azerbaijan airlines customer review,i flew from jfk to israel via baku and had very positive experience with azerbaijan airlines jfkbaku the plane was a quarter full so i had 4 seats to myself it was a new and clean airplane i was served kosher food even though they say on their website its not available on that flight the airport in baku is brand new free wifi again almost empty
20639,tigerair australia,2,refunds not provided for change of mind,absolutely ridiculous refund policies i had no need for a flight i had booked and wanted to cancel with a weeks notice only to be told that refunds are not provided for change of mind consideration of circumstances out of control should be considered here and refusing a refund when given suitable notice is abhorrent i now have to make a trip just to avoid wasting my money i will not fly with tigerair ever again lesson learned
4658,asiana airlines,4,korean air fared far better,during the flight a huge majority of the passengers as well as most if all not of the cabin crew were koreans except from the announcements turbulence arriving message etc played over the pa system all other announcements asking if anyone wanted extra servings of beverages or had rubbish for throwing etc relayed by the flight attendants facetoface were done in the korean language only no efforts were made by the cabin crew to engage nonkorean speaking passengers as they seemed to have forgotten that there were passengers of other nationalities on board in this aspect korean air fared far better
7464,copa airlines,4,there was no one there,first we were rebooked for no known reason through a different country to get home so the travel time was going to be longer but that isnt the worst that happened the bigger problem was that coming back from our wedding my husband was asked if he could give up his extra seat as copa was overbooked he told them no because that is a comfort necessity for him after that conversation my husband started looking for other flights that we could take because he felt bad for the gate agent who was visibly distressed and he found flights that would work to get us back home earlier and to a better airport he went to the gate agent with that information and she was ecstatic that they could get a few more people on the flight while accommodating us the original flight took off and then they informed us they were unable to get us on the other flights as expected we were told that we would have a night in miami on copa so we accepted that not that we had any other choice at that point when we got to miami there was no one there to take us to a hotel as had been promised after calling we were told that all agents were gone for the day so we would have to submit a complaint to get reimbursed so here we are if you say you will do something make sure it happens
4398,ana all nippon airways,9,the best airline experience,manila to vancouver via tokyo as part filipino and part japanese im proud to say that the presentation of the safety video is very nostalgic and very cultural which is what i love the effort cleanliness quality and excellent service of the japanese food and care from the flight attendants is superior the food tastes freshly steamed and cooked with juicy flavors from the main dish whereas the small side dishes tastes great plus mini ice cream for dessert entertainment was great too i even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact reminding to wear your seatbelt and pa announcements on the mini tv screen the cleanliness in the aircraft the space and comfortably is superb my only concern is the room space for the leg space for the economy class in the very back seat which is connected to the wall either way the seat itself with the pillows and the blankets are pretty comfortable and clean i highly recommend to anyone to look into ana their honesty about operating during a pandemic crisis like at this time is strongly recommended to those who are struggling to return to their homes i would like to say thank you so much again for your hard work and effort and for taking us home safely during this pandemic as its tough to work through this crisis this is the best airline experience i had been through
6260,bulgaria air,9,flight was very pleasant,sofia to amsterdam i flew with bulgaria air last april at the gate the stewardess that was checking the tickets told me i got a upgrade to business when we entered the plane a a320 around 15 years old we were created i was seated at the second row of business class at the seat a bottle of mineral water when we reached our cruising altitude the stewardess came with the food for the business class we had a traditional bulgarian breakfast with banisa yogurt and some fruites it was very tasty the flight itself was very pleasant after landing in amsterdam the stewardesses said good bye after disembarking
6139,brussels airlines,2,second one gets cancelled automatically,flight comfort is okay in economy class no issue there from now on i will avoid them as much as i can due to the following experience i booked a return flight berbruber but due to my own mistake the first flight was booked for the evening instead of the morning as there are no alternatives with bu i booked a single flight to brussels with another company and didnt check in for the brussels airlines ticket if you dont checkin into the first flight the second one gets cancelled automatically if you dont confirm with their services within a day or so and the heads up is done with a simple email on a saturday morning in my case i ended not being able to checkin with the flight back to berlin calls the support and just get brushed off that i should have read the fine prints
9595,flair airlines,1,choose a different airline,luckily westjet had a flight the same night so i could get to my destination the online system was unavailable the agent could not speak english very well at the airport and no one would answer a phone call for help choose a different airline if your time is valuable and you dont want to miss a day catching another flight
1527,air dolomiti,9,air dolomiti customer review,psamuc in june 2014 in economy class flight left with 25mins delay due to a medical emergency on board spacious cabin in this nice embraer 195 aircraft refreshing towel for hands and face was offered before takeoff and after takeoff the meal service begun including a sandwich and drinks wine is offered in a real glass which is a bonus second time for me on this airline and truly to be recommended
6452,caribbean airlines,3,no entertainment system at all,we flew caribbean airlines from new york jfk to port of spain and back both flights were delayed by about 15 hrs without good reasons jfkpos had no entertainment system at all return flight had some but a lot of control units didnt work at all or sound was awful six of us were flying plus i tried some other available seats so i can say with certainty that a lot of units were defective food was very mediocre but acceptable so were the crews bottom line if it is much cheaper than competition then it is worth it otherwise stay away
11191,iberia,3,the airline has lost our bags,the airline has lost our bags on the start of a 4 week trip we were given phone numbers for havana where no one picks up twitter response was sarcastic and implied we double check we flew with iberia we tried whatsapp and that apparently doesnt deal with baggage issues the website says our bags cant be found and we tried the uk number with no information available and to be told that our contact details were not even attached to our ticket profile or claim despite being an iberia member and long time one world member so details are on everything understand that issues happen so not annoyed about that but the appalling customer service and total lack of information is infuriating
6231,buddha air,6,buddha air customer review,i have flown with them three times now and they are always late sometimes due to weather and are small planes so i understand meant to fly from pokhara to kathmandu on 18th but cancelled due to storm the staff are so disorganised you have to fight through the nepalese to get to the desk chaos but flew out the next morning which was late of course staff are always lovely
14303,lynx air,3,not an enjoyable experience,figured id try lynx air as the price is very affordable that is their only redeeming quality my flight was delayed in total by 11 hours the real problem was that the flight was delayed 4 times throughout the day meaning most of the passengers arrived early and were waiting around anxiously for hours it was not an enjoyable experience at all the staff had very little sympathy which okay i get it since this airline is now notorious for delays when finally on board the staff were very inexperienced and lacked the grace of attendants on the larger airlines overall 310 those 3 points only come from the affordability i wont be getting on another lynx flight ever id rather pay a bit more and have the security of a more reputable airline
11739,ita airways,6,food was a good standard,a good business class flight but for a 14 hour flight i only slept for 23 hours the crew are not overly friendly but seem to be efficient and pleasant seemed eager to please but small talk minimal dont expect the friendliness of virgin for eg the food was a good standard with 1st 2nd starter pasta course along with a main course although desserts disappointing dinner breakfast served with snacks on offer such as a rustic pie there were a couple of points to note 1 window seats offer a lot of privacy but i sat in 8a which was missing a window 2 seats are very hard leather with no mattress topping i had to use a spare duvet to make is softer but still wasnt comfortable enough 3 quite a bizarre layout with the business toilets you have to walk through the galley where the crew rest and prepare the food quite an awkward as they may be having a group chat and you feel like youre disturbing every time you use the loo
936,air austral,2,very bad attitude,i wasnt a happy guy there was an outbreak of pneumonic plague and especially in antananarivotana so i changed my return flight to avoid tana and instead opted for my return from nosy be the agent repeatedly said there would be no change fee due to the plague made perfect sense to me i wanted to avoid a plague area when i did change they had charged me the 70 change fee and they would not budge very bad attitude the flights are horrendously expensive i mean i could fly dubmru mauritius for 700 return and this hop between islands cost me close to 500 return they seem to have the routes tied up with air madagascar would i be a cynic for thinking there may be a total lack of competition between them more competition needed her asap a twostar due to the change fee and cost of the flights
5347,bangkok airways,6,only option is economy class,bangkok to mandalay bangkok airways is good but not a lot its not good to get in a plane where the only option is economy class and you have to use a bus with almost 100 people on it the food is good
7121,citilink,9,arguably the best lcc in indonesia to date,yogyakarta yia to jakarta cgk onboard qg9779 the light load of this flight means that the check in was done in a very fast manner and the checkin staff dealt with our tickets and bags fairly quickly the applaudable part of it was that the checkin staff was very conscientious knowing that our seats were assigned randomly she willingly and proactively offered us to get a seat in the same row that was very nice of her boarding commenced on time and i was welcomed by the crew once again the light load of this flight meant that social distancing was possible the cabin crews started moving several passengers who have asked for a seat change to seats a and f only so that a very safe distance was created seat was comfortable well sanitized and so did the cabin there were not much to do in this short hop as we took off and landed relatively ontime overall i can see why citilink is rated as a 4star airline and a 5star airline for covid19 handling special praise goes to the crews and the ground staff of this airline for being conscientious friendly proactive and smart arguably the best lcc in indonesia to date
760,air arabia,2,worst airline i have ever used,worst airline i have ever used they treat us like we are flying for free staff here is very rude to customers and things are not even organised a bit around here this was totally disappointing and i will never travel air arabia again
6114,british airways,4,downright rude and abusive,obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really dont need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldnt want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious
5500,batik air,6,food was just edible,perth to denpasar checkin at perth airport was fast and friendly business class passengers are invited to use the qantas lounge a simple breakfast was available boarding called after the queues had reduced so no waiting on boarding friendly welcome but not shown to seat offered pretakeoff juice departure was on time after seat belt sign turned off blankets and sony headsets were offered for entertainment and meal service commenced choice of vegetables with rice or chicken with rice tray was presented with cut fresh fruit chocolate cake hot meal and a glass of water metal cutlery provided food was just edible no coffee or tea service apparently no milk available on board anyway meal trays were cleared away quickly no further service offered entertainment was ok 18 english language movies plus a number of foreign language movies could not access music no alcohol offered and not available only water juice and pepsi were available call bells were answered in seconds crew were smiling but not engaging indonesian arrival forms only provided after being asked seat comfort was excellent and although not lie flat the seat was fully adjustable arrival on time remote stand used a private mini bus for business class to terminal arrival formalities completed quickly and luggage appeared around half an hour after landing batik air although marketed as full service and clearly they are not they are priced lower than the other indonesian carrier operating the same route
3028,air transat,4,vegetarian and i was given a chicken meal,the seats are good since i paid extra to get it however my meal selection was vegetarian and i was given a chicken meal thank god i am always cautious and these situations make me more paranoid and not trust people and services i was given chicken pasta instead of veg pasta i called the rep and asked if this was veg or chicken the guy laughed and said no its chicken its a mistake i am vegetarian because i have severe allergies to meat fish and seafood products he went and brought back a veg pasta and there was no apology nothing gave me butter but no bread but others got bread the movies are same as other air transat and old ones i paid extra to get this
4303,american eagle,2,never fly american airlines,louisville to dallas we arrived at the airport at 416pm because our flight was set to leave at 635 pm the boarding pass at first was not confirmed at the ticket desk the staff had to go get a supervisor he said she could not find it because my flight had been changed to depart at 8pm instead of gate 29 we were now 49 we walked to 49 i looked at my phone and at 417pm and got an alert starting the flight would be late i was already at the ticket desk by then then after sitting for two hours next to gate 49 they announced my flight gate had changed to 1 i have a fused foot and if my daughter had not been with me i would not have made that walk with my luggage in time i will never fly american airlines or its affiliates ever again
6192,brussels airlines,4,would never take again for a long flight,lisbon to geneva via brussels with brussels airlines flight attendants were strict and unhappy no snacks or water served on 3 hour flight everything served was extremely expensive and unreasonable had to personally go to cabin to get cup of water would never take again for a long flight landing was very unsatisfactory very bumpy and wing tipped
16002,philippine airlines,5,dont care much about frequent flyers,the focus of my review at this time is on their mabuhay miles frequent flyer program i usually take a domestic flight which will connect to manila or cebu for an international flight all via pal this saves me from trouble in case i would miss my connection from experience they would rebook me to the next flight for free if there are problems with the connection and that is okay but accommodation and food arent included though thats fine by me with so many flights i became a frequent flyer and their program is useful in terms of extra baggage allowance and priority tag priority boarding and lounge access but thats it they dont care much about frequent flyers in other aspects especially redemption if you redeem a oneway international flight ticket expect that your hard earned miles are to be practically useless because you will still pay a huge amount even if you redeem a round trip ticket you will still pay hefty airline charges because apparently the miles are only for the base fare ive been so used to flying with sq where i only pay the very minimal 10 airport tax upon miles redemption even for a oneway mnlsin ticket so i find pals redemption rules weird and a money grab then theres the problem with redemption nominees that can be easily done online with other airlines like sq but not pal its like 1995 you need visit their ticket office or call their hotlines if you want to redeem for other people they would have you wait for 2 to 3 hours at their ticket office worst experience in their ticket office in alabang then charge you a rush fee for redemption made less than 10 days from the intended flight from the provinces in pi i now take an extra day for layover in manila just to fly with other airlines because pal is getting ridiculous if their frequent flyer program doesnt change then good bye
11334,icelandair,7,my first time on icelandair was good,my first time on icelandair was good thanks to the checkin crew all my baggage was free for checkin the seating was okay but the inflight entertainment was very modest with little excitement or a variety of options all i had was nothing but free drinks
12478,jetstar asia,1,i regret my decision every single time,flew from kuala lumpur to singapore never ever fly with jetstar due to connection flight timing i have had to fly jetstar 6 times within the past 6 months and i regret my decision every single time leg room cramped departure late 66 times service sub par regardless of price it is just not worth the headache it is understandable that an airlines flight is late here and there but every single time is just absurd please do yourself a favour and never fly with jetstar asia
13725,liat,9,i was very pleasantly surprised,trinidad to barbados i was planning a long weekend with friends in trinidad i live mostly in barbados but also in london uk id been umming and aahhing between liat and caribbean airlines and i checked out the reviews for liat which are definitely not good i regularly fly between barbados and jamaica via caribbean airlines which involves a stoptransit through trinidad and my transit experiences have not been good delays cancellations etc one time arriving in barbados at around 300am instead of the scheduled 945m and anyone who knows piarco airport would agree that it has to be the most soulless airport ever no information is given few places to eat get a coffee etc piarco departure lounge is brutal in the end i decided on caribbean airlines for my outward bound flight and liat for my return i rationalised that if the ca flight due to depart at around 845 was late i could spend hours there whereas if i took the afternoon liat fight even with cancellations that i stood a reasonably good chance of arriving in barbados before midnight as it happens luck seemed to have been on my side liat reviews are full of tales of delays cancellations rude staff wtc im happy to say that this was not my experience the flight departed 5 minutes later than its scheduled 235 pm time slot which in aviationairline term is not at all late and got me into barbados within the hour all staff were pleasant and helpful as needed we were served a beverage which ca did not offer on the outward bound journey flight was pleasant seats were reasonably comfortable pilotcaptain kept us informed and i really liked their inflight magazine overall i was very pleasantly surprised because as i said liat has very poor reviews and everyone that i had consulted prior to booking had warned me off liat as i say i may just have been very fortunate but for this flight at least everything went well and if liat could maintain this standard i would happily fly liat again even though im a confirmed ca fan
23126,zipair,3,there is no free water,i asked the ground crew during check in if i can fill in my water bottle and they said that the cabin crew will help later when i asked the cabin crew for water they said there is no free water
18581,smartwings,6,definitely great value,dubai to prague with smartwings although the flight was booked via czech airlines the carrier was smartwings a czech low cost carrier that said i was pleasantly surprised or maybe had very little expectations the flight departed from t2 at dubai airport so it took a little longer to get to check in the check in agent could not add my czech airlines frequent flyer number but after checking with his supervisor he was told that skyteams miles are eligible the service was delayed without any announcement however the pilot promised to make up the lost time enroute tight seats but the food and service by the cabin crew was fine the flight attendents seem to have favourites on board offering them pillows and blankets whilst others were being asked to serve themselves the blankets from the overhead lockers there were not enough pillows or blankets even though this was an overnight flight overall an ok service and for the price paid definitely great value
14895,myanmar airways,6,it did not disappoint,bangkok to yangon retjurn in midmay this is my first experience with this airline and it did not disappoint the checkin at the airport for both flights were uneventful efficiently handled and most notably having little or no queues which is always a welcomed sight when there are snaking queues at neighbouring counters for other airlines the boarding for the outgoing flight started a little after the scheduled time the planes do not have any seatback entertainment units but for the outgoing flight there was onboard wifi which allow you free access to a selection of movies and tv shows on the mai app which can be preloaded onto phones ipads etc the selection was limited for a 6570 min flight it is impressive that the cabin crew is able to come round with wet tissues followed by a meal and drinks service the cabin crew were polite and cheerful the captain made announcements regularly which were spoken in clear english
3734,airnorth,6,good value for money,the airnorth flight did not get off to a good start having been delayed by an hour once in the air service was efficient and effective the in flight food was satisfactory the seats are adequate with sufficient pitch and recline to not cause any issues the tickets were bought on special giving good value for money
938,air austral,3,they just keep stalling,nosy be madagascar to paris cdh via reunion the connecting flight was cancelled so had overnight stay in reunion then next day flight was earlier than the original schedule so had to overnight in paris the promised hotel booked by air austral was not honoured had to chase to get refund for hotel booked myself still waiting for compensation that was agreed by air austral despite continued emails they just keep stalling unfair and gives a terrible impression of air austral
14154,lufthansa,3,everything extra is now charged,lufthansa has now become the european legacy carrier cutting costs to compete with the growing low cost carriers nearly everything extra is now charged checked bags seats food etc to change flights sometimes costs more expensive than buying a new ticket and from my past four flights with them none left on time they have announced a new cabin refurbishment i am skeptical
20783,transaero airlines,9,transaero airlines customer review,my lh flight vkofra continuing to vie was cancelled and so i was rebooked on transaero on a direct flight to vie had low expectations but was totally caught by surprise when i entered the pretty new 737800 their cclass is a real cclass with 22 seat configuration perfect seat pitch lunch menu and utmost pleasant and friendly service i took japanese rolls as a starter and a grilled seabass as main course food looked appealing and tasted delicious entertainment was low but on a 3 hours flight not an issue at least not for me will be definitely an option for future flights to moscow and beyond
18056,silkair,2,my luggage was broken,penang to singapore i was arriving to singapore on the delayed mi349 on last saturday 12may2018 i always trust sia would handle my baggage properly as compared to other airlines while getting my luggage covered with luggage cover and with my trust with sia companies i did not check my baggage when i was still inside the airport i took a grab home took my dinner before i was to unpack my stuffs i got terribly shocked to look at how my luggage was broken when i opened the cover it is all cracked inside from the adjustable handler until down 30 of my luggage i did not place much stuffs inside my luggage but spare luggage and clothes i contacted the customer service through the online form provided on the same night and followed up again on 16may2018 wednesday no news from silkair at all i have tried to call silkair but keep getting the wrong information online it is one week since i last arrived and complained now still no sign of following up the fare is not justifying on what we can get
16437,qantaslink,8,a comfortable flight,a comfortable flight seated in a pair of two seats on the left of the aircraft the ground service and on board service were friendly and efficient and we were pleasantly surprised to get a tasty snack and an alcoholic or nonalcoholic drink on this short leg plus an easter chocolate the flight operated about 20 mins late there was no attempt to enforce the airlines policy on takeon baggage luckily we were on early and could find space for our takeon bags over our seats but other people were struggling due to the suitcasesize bags allowed on board
4971,avianca,1,a horrible experience,unbelievable never in my 30 years of flights have i encountered such a horrible experience i booked one way thank god to ecuador and they had us waiting for about an hour before take off without any info there was not even a cup of water available the air vents above our seats dispenses hot air in an already hot cabin the directions to access the wifi were clear but no service was ever available overall a horrible experience
18114,silkair,5,silkair customer review,the outbound flight from cok was on time and the crew were tolerant to us even though we were a bit late to get to the gate the crew were friendly and the food was okay had ordered an avml meal the boeing sky interior was fantastic the leg space was a bit small im around 6 foot and i was cramped the crew were friendly and pleasant the toilet was clean too however i cant believe that they have no personal ife screens and no headphones were provided either i spent the 4 hour journey reading and sleeping the inbound flight was pretty much the same as the the outbound but the seats were quite worn out the worst thing was the food
6522,cathay dragon,6,dimsum for breakfast,hong kong to kaohshiung in october 2018 dimsum for breakfast no other menu the dumpling is delicious but i dont really like the radish cake but the service was good crowded flight quite a jam for toilet
8977,etihad airways,2,flight was disappointing,i was very disappointed and uncomfortable with how etihad airways was treating me on a 6 hour flight from abu dhabi to brussels on december 15th this was one of the worst overnight flights i have ever experienced in economy class the inflight entertainment system was very poor and was glitching i expected the flight to be good but it was horrible the flight was disappointing the airline needs to upgrade their services next time i will never choose etihad airways for travel
6185,brussels airlines,6,distance between seats is small,moscow to brussels the plane is standard not large and very old the distance between the seats is small suitable only for not tall person inflight they give a sandwich and drinks although the choice is not large the staff is good positive
18310,singapore airlines,3,dont provide salt and pepper,no pillows in economy cabin for a 13hr flight i was offered an extra blanket to use as a makeshift pillow hardly comfortable meal portions were small no salad or small starter was offered no towelette and they dont provide salt and pepper sachets with the meal wifi was erratic and terminal 2 is a non event due to renovations all in all a highly unsatisfactory experience and we will think twice before flying singapore airlines again
17024,royal brunei airlines,8,really cheap and not that bad,melbourne to kota kinabalu via bander seri begawan on royal brunei the boeing 787 business class was superior than i thought it was going to be yes they dont serve any kind of alcohol however its possible to buy a small bottle in duty free after security and bring it on the plane with you the crew will not serve it to you however ask for a mixer and ice and do it yourself the seats laid down to a flat bed and at 6ft 4inches roughly it was just a little short to lie on my back im 6ft 7 however with a bit of adjustment i was able to get comfortable and sleep the only negative thing about the seat was the headrest its not moveable in any direction this makes relaxing in a z shape almost impossible food was good on the flight from australia they served a variety of australian inspired dishes and on the return more arabic influenced fare crew were quick to respond to drink requests etc decent sized portions as well you dont get a decent amenity kit and it resembles something from economy class with an eye mask ear plugs and thats about it no pjs either however it is really cheap and not that bad for the money spent
7855,cubana airlines,1,worst airline i have flown with,toronto to cayo coco cubana airlines is the worst airline i have ever flown with my 6am flight meant i was ready to check in at 3am only to find the flight was now delayed by 6 hours to noon and then at 930 delayed again to 1430 what a complete joke and 15 for snacks is supposed to be compensation come on cubana airlines this is ridiculous

428,aerolineas argentinas,4,asked to move to emergency row,buenos aires to rio de janeiro bad service asked to move to emergency row because the regular row is too tight for my size 193cm and cause hurt to my legs the answer was no because i have problems with my legs ridiculous i frequently travel in the emergency row and i am fully capable that discussion would not exist if they have normal space for legs
15176,norse atlantic airways,4,charged us 120 euros to check a bag,my flight from jfk to berlin was fine no complaints on the flight back though they charged us 120 euros to check a bag that they accepted as a carryon in the us we noticed on our flight back to the us that the plane wasnt anywhere close to full and that the overhead bins had abundant space for our bags this is clearly another budget airline desperate to rip money out of passengers wallets at the last moment and im happy theyre cutting off their jfkberlin route in late august two stars not one though since their flight attendants are universally lovely maybe the money getting scammed out of my wallet is going toward actually paying them well
19261,sun country airlines,1,what a joke of an airline,i would give this airline a 0 if i could we are very displeased with the service that we have had this past week with this airline this was supposed to be a special trip for our honeymoon as we have recently been married it started out great in denver colorado and we get everything checked in at the airport and paid money for the checked bags our first flight was delayed due to they couldnt find the plane is what we got told over the intercom the flight was delayed about 40 minutes for that and delayed another 20 minutes for the passenger who threw up before take off we then missed our connection flight which was serviced by the same airline sun country they knew we were coming and didnt wait 10 minutes for the 3 2 in my party and one other man going to myrtle beach of us they got us on the soonest flight with southwest and reassured us multiple times that our bags would be sent to our final destination we asked 3 people to make sure and even checked baggage claim and we were told that it would be ok we arrive in myrtle beach to no bags and no contact from anyone from this airline we have been working with a southwest agent to get the information we have spent the last 4 days in myrtle beach with absolutely no luggage thanks to you guys it took me hours to try and get a hold of you guys and when i finally did you guys werent happy or trying at all to get us our bags our honeymoon was absolutely ruined and now they only want to reimburse half of the money we spent on essential needs what a joke of an airline
21669,vietnam airlines,5,flight itself was quite pleasant,travelling business class was an easy decision with very good fares out of sydney luckily i was aware of a 16 hour layover on return journey despite this i enjoyed a day in hanoi the flight itself was quite pleasant and the staff were very polite and were really helpful with my age 71 with very good food however the nightmare began when i requested the posting of frequent flier miles the first response was standard we will reply within 5 days was advised of only 1000 miles and requested documentation sent within 24 hours this went back and forth to the end result being told to send more documentation i forwarded everything but my original boarding pass difficult given that it was an electronic boarding pass to my phone three months 21 emails numerous facebook messages later advised to call lotusmiles in vietnam unfortunately they could not assist as they did not speak english but to send email i had already requested via travel agent to purchase another trip but will not support vietnam airlines
6498,caribbean airlines,3,caribbean airlines customer review,jfkposgeo return cabin was okay staff unfriendly and no entertainment not allowed to exit piarco despite a 6 hour wait and they changed the gate number 10 mins before departure time meaning everyone had to go through security check again
11271,iberia express,6,a pleasant experience,madrid to gatwick flight was on time at first it looks like the seat pitch is fine this has been achieved by removing the seat pocket one normally finds below the tray table however once person in front declined their seat it became very unpleasant the tray table came close to my stomach and it would have been very difficult to use the table fortunately there was an empty row across and one was able to move seats the wifi worked but it only allows you to watch information and movies on iberia express page and you are unable to surf the net or send emails go on facebook etc the movie and tv selection was quite good but as there is no seat charger i didnt want to lose my charge so did not use it in the end the crew were largely absent but drinks and food menu all charged was very adequate for short haul budget flight all in all a pleasant experience bar the ridiculous seats
16730,regional express,8,regional express customer review,coober pedy to adelaide nice experience check in at a little bungalow in the desert friendly ground staff unhealthy snacks like chips or something sweet but they also offered drinks seatback was not able to recline
4727,aurigny air,5,aurigny air customer review,we had a weekend trip to guernsey from gatwick both flights were late on the return flight seated at the back of the aircraft i was subject to the flight attendants conversation grumbling about their job and their employer i feel a little put off from making future leisure trips to guernsey as this airline is quite expensive suffers delays and does not provide the warmest service
7625,corsair,5,corsair customer review,purchased 2 tickets in grand large class from st martin to paris round trip nowhere in the options displayed are you told that you leave from grand case airport in st martin you are not told that you change not only planes but airlines as well in point a pitre guadeloupe passengers should know these facts before they purchase their tickets we rushed to grand case to find out that the flight we were on had been cancelled this left us with 4 hours to kill in sxm and a 30 minute connection in ptp luckily our luggage made it we will not travel on corsair again if we can avoid it the service on board was not the best the seats left a lot to desire their video equipment and headsets are old fashioned the food was not that great either
17857,shanghai airlines,9,was a very positive surprise,hong hong to budapest via shanghai flew on a320 on hkg to shanghai while in a newer b7879 on the long haul to budapest china eastern marketed flights the long haul leg was flown by their daughter company shanghai airlines to budapest amazing experience pure adventure bought this ticket some months earlier for the high season to europe as a huge bargain for 347 usd including 2 x 23 kg of luggage which is welcomed near xmas it costed me in addition positioning and depositioning flights to which i volunteered as i needed the extra miles for my elite status however i was notified 2 months before travel by my online travel agent travelgenio that the return flight from budapest was preponed by 1 hour then i was forced to change as i would not be able to arrive in time for the new departure i then decided to change plans completely and celebrate new year in budapest instead of vietnam thus i postponed my return travel from budapest by 3 days this was done by emails to the travel agent no response and then phone calls to ch eastern in brisbane and shanghai eventually it went smoothly and i was changed to my wish without added costs apart from changing onward flights beyond hong kong with another airline that even allowed me to do another cheap detour to hanoi on my way back to hue the homepages of china eastern and shanghai are difficult to penetrate and to book or change bookings from unless one has a chinese telephone number however 10 days before departure i could access seating and chose freely my favourite seats even got 1 of 4 legs in exit seat however one cannot access the entire booking unless registered with ces flyer program in which i am not interested apart from that it was a good adventure a complicated travel where everything could have gone wrong but all went smooth arrived in hongkong early and was able to checkin 6 hours before departure as the airline have many departures daily no queues at the checkin and the ground staff were good and answered questions though fearing speaking english two bps issued immediately flying hkgpvg is considered as international flights though it could be considered as domestic that give the advantage of not leaving transit while leaving hkg and passing pvg first flight was on an aged a320 extremely controlled and organised priority boarding at gate where all business and elite flyers were boarding entirely before the remaining passengers onboard newspapers and 10 channels of music were offered bring own headset shared monitors showed some educational movies food was limited to a tidy pack of biscuits drinks were unlimited water tea coffee beers but only for 1 hour out of the 2 hour long flight during ascend and descend all services were closed down until 40 minutes after kickoff and again 40 minutes before landing that leaves passengers with very limited time of service fas were fine the second flight were by shanghai airlines boeing 787 it was a very positive surprise and was faultless modern aircraft good food and service 2 hot meals offered at dinner and then again at breakfast frequent drink rounds button calls answered quickly and needs were addressed instantly individual ife on touchscreen monitors was very easy and quick to operate with a good number of western and english translated movies toilets clean both flights took off earlier than scheduled
19888,tap portugal,6,still a very solid and reliable product,overall good experience and i would do it again pros brand new plane with top notch entertainment system including selection of 150 movies the captain was very attentive to the passengers and communicating regularly particularly during a long period of moderate turbulence which was scary he also explained why they left with a small delay related to the late arrival of the previous flight from tel aviv the online booking and checkin system was flawless and very intuitive cons boarding from a remote stand in lisbon but thats not the airlines fault inflight staff was efficient but not particularly friendly like in asian airlines food was not great but still edible the lunch was served immediately after take off and then a light meal was served just before landing considering the flight was almost 8 hours there were more than 6 hours between meals and no drinks or food were served during that period tap long haul is not a slam dunk but still a very solid and reliable product to take you from europe to north america my favourite feature was the inflight entertainment system i regretted not getting the economy xtra seat for almost 8 hours it is probably worth it as the standard seat is very cramped and for anyone over 180 m it will not be that comfortable
21288,turkmenistan airlines,5,turkmenistan airlines customer review,recently travelled to india and back during the volcanic ash issues lots of people complain about this airline but at the end of the day you get what you pay for outgoing flight was on time no entertainment on board something they do need to look into food and service is what you would expect from the price of the ticket the return journey was a little more complicated because of the volcanic ash everyone was asked to check in and several hours later the flight was cancelled they should have phoned everyone not to come to the airport i was travelling with my young son and 2 daughters which made it difficult they did provide food water coffee etc and the taxi fare back home to the village when the flight was cancelled askhabad airport is now 10 times cleaner than amritsar
15974,philippine airlines,6,cabin crew was professional,flight was delayed approximately 35hrs taking off honolulu at 3pm instead of 1135am the ground staff at pal provided free refreshments a nice touch once airborne the flight was very smooth as far as inflight service i couldnt ask for better airline service the cabin crew was professional courteous and attentive even passing out menus in economy which i havent seen in years hot towels were passed out before landing again a nice touch after a smooth and wonderful flight what spoiled everything was that not all of our luggage was delivered the baggage personnel stated that my sons baggage 2 pieces and my wifes baggage 1 piece was pulled and not loaded on our aircraft due to possible weight issues which i dont believe as none of this was ever brought to my attention when we checked in our luggage my wife and son completed the paperwork for the missing luggage and for compensation the baggage personnel stated they would load the baggage on the next days pr 101 and deliver to our hotel the flight is delayed even more not landing in manila until approximately 9pm tonight i hope our missing luggage will be delivered my son had to buy clothes since none of his luggage was delivered as much as i would like to give pal a 5star rating because of the wonderful inflight service this luggage issue prevents me from doing this the delay i can tolerate but the luggage issue is inexcusable how pal handles this luggage issue will determine if i fly them again i will be extremely furious if this issue is not resolved
21835,virgin america,6,virgin america customer review,when i flew with vx i was impressed however there were a few problems my screen froze a lot and my seat barely reclined i did like that there was a good selection of music and that you could watch live tv overall the flight was great
12840,kenya airways,3,the worst experience i have ever had,cape town to mumbai via nairobi i have taken loads of flights in the last few years all across the world and this is by far the worst experience i have ever had our flight was delayed for over 10 hours because there was no crew availability because of that our connecting flight was missed and we were rescheduled to a flight which made us reach mumbai 25 hours late when we reached the airport the system was not working and we were given hand written boarding passes the process delayed the flight by more than 4 more hours the airline staff were clueless as they apparently said that the head office in nairobi was not picking their calls i dont know what is up with kenya airways its better to cancel the trip than to travel with them
15070,nok air,4,baggage was missing the lock,flight was 20 minutes delayed at phuket airport they have a huge single check in line for all the flights it doesnt matter if you do the online check in it takes a long time you cannot eat your own food on the plane when we arrived to bangkok my checked baggage was missing the lock i asked customer service why they removed the lock and if they could give me the lock back and they said that the lock was not found but they didnt understand our english we decided to go and leave it like that
5472,batik air,8,seat was very comfortable,denpasar to jakarta at gate was driven to the aircraft by van hand luggage taken onto the air by staff shown to my seat 2f by cabin crew seat was very comfortable and was asked if i would like juice or water once airborne the cabin crew handed out hot towels and headsets food was delicious served with bread roll entree dessert which were all delicious entertainment had a good variety also looking forward to flying them again

7027,china southern airlines,9,ticket change and refund is much greater,china southern airlines has gradually phased out a number of old 772 and now the mainstream of widebody is boeing 77300er and a330 business class can lie flat and in 121 layout at this time the initiative of ticket change and refund is much greater this is very good
7564,corendon airlines,1,do not youve been warned,bad service and ripoff first please note that when flying corendon everything thinkable will be charged surplus not doing online self checkin will cost an extra 10eur pp any additional luggage other than cabinluggage is charged surplus 1x20kg 60eur a coffee inflight would have cost me 3 eur surplus further the flightinformation was not understandable but at least deafening conclusion do not youve been warned
8831,ethiopian airlines,5,okay for what they charge,first time using ethiopian airlines check in at heathrow t2 was pretty quick although the checkin agent failed to include my frequent flier status on the boarding pass which presented issues when trying to use the fast track lounges luckily i had a copy on my mobile used the silverkris lounge which is good boarding a bit disorganised but once onboard my seat 11a was comfortable enough flight departed on time for the 7 hour flight to addis ababa service food dinner breakfast and crew where okay the ptv was also alright the seat not too bad arriving addis the transfer was straight forward and the airport itself wasnt too bad i used the cloud nine gold lounge which is a bit better than the general terminal boarding the 2nd flight was again a bit of a mess another a350 and once again seat 11a however the seat had a fault so not too comfortable crew where a bit vacant on this flight the food a sandwich and lunch was again okay perhaps better than the first flight arrived cpt more or less on time after a flight of around 6 hours bags delivered quickly so i suppose all in all ethiopian got me from a to b finally c without too much stress i guess the one improvement would be the ground operation its pretty poor and rude at some points i wouldnt use ethiopian again but they are okay for what they charge
13564,latam airlines,2,unwelcome as a customer,as with all latam flights so far no onboard service despite premium economy no lounge for domestic flights delays and the feeling of being completely unwelcome as a customer
20528,tianjin airlines,9,tianjin airlines customer review,never heard of this airline until i flew in july on embraer 190 from tianjin to ningbo but impressed by service standards at the airport the check in and boarding was quick and efficient and fas were very attentive okay their english language skills need improving but never seen such an efficient and smiling set of fas seats comfortable for this quite short trip meals was also good lack of newspapers though will fly them again in september and woulkd have no doubts about recommending them to others as a musttry airline
16137,play,6,play airlines is truly a budget ride,play airlines is truly a budget ride the seats are unpadded and thin everything has a charge carry on roller board or checked luggage etc the legroom is slightly more than an american carrier air is not exchanged very frequently and cabin pressure is not ideal my ears stayed tight for several days and i had difficulty hearing not what one wants when they are a musician baggage handling isnt good so dont take pricey luggage on the plus side the flights arrive either ahead of schedule or on time if you are looking for the cheapest travel option possible this is for you
14579,malindo air,3,most inconsistent airline,colombo to sydney via bali the most inconsistent airline i have ever travelled with the the poorest comfort by far food for purchase with correct money currency only and no credit facility for electronic payment every flight i took from sydney to bali to kl through to colombo was tough to purchase was only able to purchase on location of currency for food beverage purchases you better be on the flights were either delayed and cause a scramble for the connection flights the staff are surprisingly ok because they are not overworked the seats in economy are so uncomfortable malindo also misplaced my luggage on a 8hr layover in dps and i was left stranded until my luggage arrived for connecting flight 4 hrs later i strongly advise anyone thinking of flying with malindo to definitely take a more reputable airline carrier as you may not want this sort of experience like i had
3981,alitalia,7,offers basic snack service,berlin to rome i had flying blue points to redeem so i used them for my flight from berlin to rome i was a bit apprehensive at first with alitalia being in receivership after having been ditched by etihad but i proceeded anyway knowing that in the unlikely event that the airline goes belly up i still have other options as with most intraeuropean flights alitalia offers basic snack service on board a drink and a snack either sweet or salty was being served on this 2 hour flight as i was seated in the exit row leg space was generous seats were leather seats in black flight attendants were smartly dressed in black pant suit with scarf emblazoned with alitalia colours
10307,georgian airways,6,cheap lowcost airline,pros direct flight from barcelona to tbilisi competitive prices aircraft is comfortable cons cant choose your meal no inflight entertainment aircraft is rather small embraer 190 yet comfortable cant beat direct flights and good prices other than that it just feels like a cheap lowcost airline but still my preferred option for my location
3073,air transat,1,a pleasant experience,ft lauderdale to toronto what a pleasant experience from the fort lauderdale counter to the plane at the fort lauderdale the staff was so humble and funny while he was checking all our paperwork he took our stress away on the plane the staff were super amazing to handle my kids inquiries they answered them very professionally we received sanitizers pack and complementary drinks i needed that so much so as my kids very polite plane entertainment system i wasnt aware air transat has entertainment for free you can bring your own headphones and voila you have hours of entertainments last ten years i have been traveling to florida twice a year to my parents its just a three hour flight so never experienced this type of awesome service my kids didnt have any headphones the flight attendant provided headphones for free it was getting better and better thank you air transat for your awesome service i will be traveling soon in march to punta cana hopefully i will be able to travel with you guys again

17959,shenzhen airlines,4,shenzhen airlines customer review,shenzhendalian c class good quick check in with attentive check in staff used the business and first class aisle to fast track security otherwise it would have taken ages to clear security the business class lounge was very comfortable and spacious with free drinks and nibbles plenty of tvs computer terminals and newspapers to read the plane was clean seating in business class comprised of 3 rows with 2 seats on each side of the aisle food and drinks were plentiful with the flight attendants providing a very good service flight announcements by both the flight crew and cabin staff were firstly in chinese and then english
15263,norwegian,6,arrived 15 minutes ahead of time,norwegian flight from copenhagen to helsinki on 07feb operated by jet time departed five minutes ahead of schedule and arrived 15 minutes ahead of time due to the shortage of planes norwegian has wetleased a number of planes from other companies because of this issue this flight was operated by danish charter airline jet time with a not entirely new boeing 737700 the plane was a little worn but fine for the short one and a half hour flight the jet time cabin crew seemed to be a little less trained than norwegians regular crew but they were smiling and helpful if people had questions in general i would much prefer flying jet time rather than facing a cancellation due to the shortage of planes however if you expect modern planes decent legroom and wifi you should probably not choose a flight operated by jet time
18804,southwest airlines,2,advise you to find another airline,i entered premium economy as i paid the fee to upgrade my boarding status so i could get a seat in the front of the plane on a preferred aisle seat this was fine in cancun but when i was to board in houston passengers who were taken off the plane were allowed to board prior to those of us who had paid for the priority boardingseats and occupied the forward seats despite most not having paid for the seats this also occurred when departing nashville the only difference being the passengers continuing on who came in on the flight were allowed to remain on the plane and improve their seats prior to our boarding i was forced to more than halfway back in the plane if these people are continuing on they should board in the respective class with those boarding at the gate southwest is basically stealing the upgrade fee as their terrible policy of disregarding those have paid for early boarding despite those who improve their seats without paying for the privilege in flight wifientertainment was not working and there are no charging ports or receptacles to charge devices this was my first experience with the airline and i plan on it being the last at least if i pay for premium economy or business class i am able to receive my monies worth the seats were very uncomfortable that is enough i think you get the point i definitely advise you to find another airline

3926,alitalia,1,the trip was a fail,washington to rome the trip was a fail because my passport expires within the three months needed to enter rome mistake on me but my issue is after you have processed my passport and then printed my boarding pass they still allowed me to pay for bags when it should have been flagged that i wouldnt be able to fly im at the gate and the attendant looks at my passport and says you arent valid ok so will my baggage fee be refunded no this is definitely unfair contacting the customer support team was a good lesson learned that all support staff are not created equally these guys should have given my money back at the least but such is life hopefully they get better and its true you get what you pay for sometimes
18411,sky express airlines,2,i have never seen anything like it,the organisation at athens airport was simply unbelievable inept i have never seen anything like it the airline was supposed to operate windows 5361 but the queues were enormous due to insufficient staffing and poor management of the huge queues we were nor the only ones who barely made our flight some did not we were in the queue for almost two hours having arrived to the airport 2hr 15min before the flight takeoff the crew on the plane were outstandingly good and deserve credit everything else requires improvement

19305,sunwing airlines,2,needed to cancel my booking and then rebook,i made a mistake on the name of one of the tickets on the day booking upon noticing the error i used the edit option on the website to correct the name fast forward to the day before my flight turns out that the name change was not administered in order to proceed with the trip i had to call and have the name changed over the phone given the short notice they needed to cancel my booking and then rebook this cost me an additional 500 cad per passenger each traveler was booked to each have their own room at the resort upon arriving at the resort they put me and my travelling companion in the same apartment that offered two rooms this was not clear and not at all what we were expecting we wanted an apartment each and there no drop down option for booking an apartment when scheduling a trip we asked for individual apartments at the venue and we were told nothing could be done currently im discussing these matters with sunwing service via email unfortunately its been 3 days since there initial message no follow up
16743,regional express,4,regional express customer review,mel bwt return relatively easy checkin boarding on short 1 hour flight teacoffee nibbles served by friendly fa a minor problem was in the different configuration of the aircraft all are saab 340 on outward flight there were overhead lockers above the 2 seat side of the aircraft but on the return when we had extra carryon there was none fortunately the flight was only half full so we could store it under the next seat they do a good job for a regional airline
2549,air new zealand,2,doing us a favour by showing up,boarding was due to start 810 flight time 840 the captain strolled in to airport gate around 850 unapologetic and acting like doing us a favour by showing up
10689,gulf air,7,we were able to change seats,i appreciate that the boarding was organized based on zones which made it very smooth and ensured everyone had enough space in the overhead compartments it was not a full flight so we were able to change seats and get more comfortable spots the first supper meal was just sandwiches which i skipped and the breakfast was pretty good with an omelette and sausage the airline needs to work on the infotainment the highlight is the reasonably priced falcon wifi which was very efficient and helped me stay in touch with my friends and family back home
2061,air koryo,5,air koryo customer review,pekfnjpek in business class on new tu204 the seats were quite spacious and airplane comfortable i thought it really odd that they served a huge meal pekfnj but only bread on the return the flight attendants were decent enough though english skills were lacking there was access to the air china lounge at pek t2 i didnt visit the lounge on the return at fnj on the flight pekfnj there were no more seats so a north korean teenager sat in the flight attendant jump seat for the whole flight on the way back the security guard sat in the flight attendant jump seat and she sort of sat on the very edge of the same jump seat and held the wall for take off and landing they also kept the curtains closed to the front of the aircraft which in the event of an evacuation would be a nono because people couldnt see to get to the exit
8072,dragonair,6,almost like a nofrills airline,kolkata to hong kong with dragonair the flight was almost like a nofrills airline did not expect this from cathay pacific no personal screens on seats no drinks options just a snack box the seats were ok though lot of turbulence especially just before landing at hong kong a big bump no seat chargers cathay pacific needs to improve its dragonair flight services on international routes
16613,qatar airways,7,water has to be requested,it was a very long flight from sydney to doha cabin crew were very attentive and professional as the flight was only during the night and everyone was trying to get as much sleep as possible i was very disappointed that water has to be requested usually there is some water available in the galley without any asking but this was not the case and also the movies available had nothing controversial on the list
10431,germanwings,3,germanwings customer review,cgn to fao cologne to faro on an a320 outbound flight a little late due to late arrival of aircraft flight was on a jetway but passengers had to use the stairs crew were nice and flight was full same on return flight from faro i had a smart price ticket so you should sit in row 4 to 14 with more legroom onward flight i was seated row 15 return row 23 as miles and more member in my profile they knew that i needed a lactose free meal but you only get a snack box cheese sandwichroll or chickensalami sandwichroll but both are not with buttermargarine they all contain cream cheese as basic spread so i was not able to eat that when the crew came around i was entitled to only one soft drink you have to pay for wine or a beer spirits not available at all since both flights were full and only 3 crew members were on board it was a hard job for them they have less toilets compared to the old lh planes so we had only 2 toilets for almost 150 passengers on the return flight one wc was not serviceable
7308,comair,6,lounge was quiet and relaxing,johannesburg to cape town comair is a franchise operation of british airways and the jnb cpt route is particularly busy we made use of the bidair concierge service to speed us through immigration and baggage collection to connect with the comair service the slow lounge was quiet and relaxing with a really impressive array of food seating in business class was identical to club europe but seats in row 1 are more freely available to non gold card executive club members unlike bas new short haul service food is served across all classes however the food served in comairs business class is inferior to that in new do co club europe communication from the flight deck was efficient as ever and we arrived slightly ahead of schedule
21850,virgin australia,7,pleasantly surprised by the virgin product,having flown with qantas many times previously i was pleasantly surprised by the virgin product if any thing comparing to my last qantas experience the virgin was a better product checking in while busy was okay the lounge is comfortable and comparable to the qantas club lounge boarding was prioritized and you received a beverage prior to take off the seat was comfortable and larger than the economy seat the service was very good with a hot meal and multiple beverages offered the cabin crew were friendly and diligent on landing my bags came out with priority something qantas has been unable to do for a while
886,air astana,8,significant improvements,st petersburg to bangkok via almaty there has been significant improvements to this airline in the fourteen years since i first flew it was a day service between st petersburg and almaty on a clean a320 seats were comfortable spacious and with a reasonable recline food was good and well presented in flight entertainment was on tablets and there was a reasonable selection cabin service was a little hit and miss i asked for wine with my meal and by the time i realised that it had been forgotten i had finished and did not ask for it the cabin crew spoke reasonablegood english but only spoke to me in russian because initially i had spoken to them in russian the check in in st petersburg was fast efficient and in english they had a bus for business class passengers to go to the plane the flight departed and arrived on time and my luggage was among the first offloaded in almaty the almaty bangkok sector was a night flight on a new dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 230 am check in in almaty was slow because the operator was dealing with problems for a couple of economy class passengers it would have been faster to use the economy check in counter food was good and the seatbed was comfortable and there was quite a selection of in flight entertainment i was identified as a foreigner and so spoken to in good english the plane left and arrived on time and again my luggage was amongst the first off the plane
10372,germanwings,8,friendly cabin staff,hannover to rome at the airport we had a very smooth transition to the gate took 20 minutes then we left everything was on time and actually arrived 20 minutes early inflight cabin staff served small sandwiches and water even though this was only a 2 hour flight the cabin staff came several times to give out beverages i enjoy germanwings clean cabin and low prices as a budget airline i was not expecting a lot but friendly cabin staff interacted with kids and gave a relaxed flight
18302,singapore airlines,5,seats were super uncomfortable,im a vegetarian the food was tasty but i have some thoughts a bun served with butter without any addition in one of the main meals i had to ask for a drink because the service walked by multiple times ignoring me i flew with them 4 times two flights of 145 hours plus 2 shorter flights on 1 out of 4 flights i can say that the service was at a high level the seats were super uncomfortable the number of drinks served for 145 hours is really poor the last drink i asked for was water and the staff brought me a tap water
11672,israir airlines,1,israir airlines customer review,rometel aviv everything about the trip was a pleasure the plane left almost on time 20 mins later than scheduled but this was already viewable 12 hrs before the flight needless to say we arrived on time considering we flew from midnight until 330 am rome time we assumed we would get very little if at all in the way of snacks wrong almost immediately each person received a bottle of water this was followed by a choice of a salad or a quite hefty sandwich finally they served tea and coffee and this in a 3hr flight the staff were courteous and effective making the flight a really enjoyable one
17925,shanghai airlines,4,shanghai airlines customer review,sha pek economy on b767300 booked online passport was sufficient checking in a matter of seconds the plane was clean comfy seats and most generous legroom i have ever experienced in an economy seat 2x3x2 configuration was nice relatively friendly but not overwhelming staff probably speaking not too much english got along with chinese well food was ok chinese certainly not for everyone though 3 drinks in roughly 90 minutes are far above domestic european standards only annoying thing the standard please remain seated turbulence ahead messages every chinese carrier plays all the time even if there wont be any
7160,citilink,7,flight attendants were friendly,i flew from jakarta to semarang on citilink it was a flight near the end of the ramadhan season so its packed since most of the passengers are traveling to their hometowns to celebrate lebaran with their families and relatives the flight was the first flight of citilink in hlp which was scheduled to depart at 515 i was notified by citilink to be at the airport 3 hours prior to the scheduled departure to avoid long lines at the airport which is a bit upsetting since i have to be at the airport by 215 only to find the flight itself was delayed for about an hour due to operational reason aside from that the trip was pretty good the ground staff were quick but a little more smiling could be better the flight attendants were friendly informative and helpful the cabin was clean and comfortable overall citilink is pretty good and i will fly with them in the future as long as they improve especially in the ground handling and the punctuality of their schedules
8807,estonian air,2,estonian air customer review,cphtll return flights were delayed both ways no meals served and inflight service horrible due to staff fa onboard generally seem careless and are simply unable to smile
9755,flydubai,4,few staff are smiling,flydubai used to be always the best option for me and my wife among the budget airlines where we use to get a convenient and quick service but now felt like it has been downgraded as a budget airlines we dont expect to get a premium service but always expecting to get at least a friendly and a professional behavior from staff but now thats also has been dropped massively only few staff are smiling and willing to help and thanks for those staff who are willing to help and support
9508,firefly,9,convenient way to travel,subang to penang a convenient way to travel at a very competitive price check in at subang airport was easy and security queue was quick service onboard was friendly and a small snack and a drink provided for no extra charge check in was slightly delayed on the return flight from penang but the agent was apologetic and the rest of the trip went smoothly
2626,air niugini,1,air niugini customer review,i have the misfortune of using air niugini often through lack of choice most recent flight was pom sin return the airline is now leasing an aging white airlines a310 which is older than the previous b767 seats are appalling ife does not work and toilets are constantly unservicable the food is passable but really nothing special service is slow and cabin crew seem unable to deal with complaints or concerns raised by passengers overall air niugini is not deserving of a three star ranking a two star ranking would be more appropriate given the decline in the airlines international services
11617,iran air,8,iran air customer review,kermansahtehranshirazisfahan flights are on time and boarding well organised flight duration is short around 1 hr iran air provides full meal service food tastes good friendly staff speak english all flights with fokker 100 aircraft which all looked well maintained
10791,hainan airlines,2,inflight the service is good,mexico city to beijing via tijuana booking the ticket was not easy with unfriendly website and selecting a seat was not possible until check in the flight was delayed for 8hrs due weather and mexico city ground staff did not help with the fact that it was a weather delay and this was not their fault inflight the service is good the flight attendants are attentive the inflight entertainment is outdated lacks variety and does not compare to other 5 star airlines the food was the worst food i have had the seats are okay
12832,kenya airways,5,will look at alternatives in the future,nairobi to mauritius this was the final leg of the itinerary from manchester to mauritius manchester to nairobi flown with qatar airways flights sold by qatar airways this flight was a short 4 hour flight nairobi airport itself if not the best for transit though we spent the 7 hour layover in the pride business class lounge having paid 40 for a day pass which was satisfactory cabin crew appeared a little unfriendly on arrival onto aircraft though pleasant with requests and service the aircraft itself appeared old and tired and could benefit from modernisation for a small flight a light meal was provided which in honesty was good asian vegetarian sadly few flight announcements and no advice that the plane was descending into mauritius and landing it just landed no inflight entertainment screen did not work finally the timing of this flight is not good arrival at mauritius at 0300 in the morning is strange and untimely not sure why the schedule is this way but certainly not a time that i would be looking at again in the future in summary an ok airline convenient to ensure qatar airways flights for the route but will look at alternatives to mauritius in the future put it this was if qatar airways either fly directly to mauritius or have a transit in seychelles or johannesburg then this would be the preferred option nairobi is ok but i think the experience with kenya airways is not something i would revisit as experienced
20481,thomson airways,7,extra leg room a waste of money,manchester to cancun with thomson we had paid for extra leg room which i felt was a waste of money as the seat is not as wide and felt uncomfortable in the middle seat there was no foot rest which would have made the 10 hour flight slightly more comfortable the entertainment was good but not what i was expecting food was nothing different to what ive had on previous flights staff were far from helpful on the outbound flight toilets are more spacious than other aircraft on the whole the dreamliner is overated in my experience and was disappointed slighty better on the way back as managed to get an aisle seat which was spare but meant sitting apart from my husband snacks very expensive compared to other airlines but complimentary drinks are available throughout the flight all in all ive travelled on better and more comfortable airlines i found flying with airtours 14 years ago to cancun was a more comfortable and enjoyable experience then the dreamliner
3184,airasia,2,airasia customer review,i booked return flights bandung singapore on 5th september 2022 i subsequently received an email from airasia on 15 october telling me that my flights were cancelled due to operational reasons a promise is made for the refund to be made in 30 days now more than a month later the refund is still in progress and no further advisories to enlighten me the status except from what i see in my account on their website airasia has no customer service no customer service phone number not even an email address all they have is an online chatbot named ava which is worse than useless so you are on your own should any problems arise after you confirm your booking will definitely avoid flying airasia if i had a choice

19160,sriwijaya air,3,terrible customer service,surabaya to jakarta i have not flown with this airline before check in experience was smooth and fast at t1 juanda airport however things got bad quickly as the flight was delayed by 15 minutes and two flights were in one departure gate making it very crowded people were sitting on the floor which was horrible when the time arrived the ground crew shouted over and over again telling people to hurry what terrible customer service the food was only one tiny horrible bread and mineral water the plane was dirty the seat pockets were filthy as well as the floor baggage claim was delayed because of the slow ground crew for me this middle service airline is worse than citilink which claims to be a budget airline
16521,qantaslink,9,qantaslink customer review,mkybnemlb return overall positive experience ontime friendly courteous staff clean aircraft with plenty of legroom nice snackfood and bar service on the evening flight back to mky qantas is still my preferred airline

16662,regent airways,6,our seats were not good,dhaka to kolkata we were kept waiting for 15 mins due to their software problems even in the business class queue at last they checked us in under special service from another counter the flight was delayed by 25hrs due to heavy fog that day but for the business class ticket we were given a good lounge with premium food and wifi so wasnt much frustrated we were chauffeured to our aircraft in a 2006 toyota axio but we were a little disappointed as despite for paying for business class our seats were not good the galleys wall was in front of us so we were deprived of a lot of leg room but suddenly a passenger fell ill as the plane taxied to the runway for takeoff so the plane had to go back to its initial position drop off the sick passenger in an ambulance and then returned to the runway resulting in another 40 min delay at last the plane took off the food quality snacks was average was served a hot dog shwarma and cake but the seat itself was comfortable beside window there was no infotainment system at all let alone wifi so was a bit disappointed landed at kolkata after a short 30 min flight
11929,jazeera airways,4,jazeera airways customer review,dxbkwisaw istanbul sabiha goken airport return for a low cost airline i was impressed with the online booking system inflight comfort leather seats good legroom free ife bring your own headset or buy one on board and connecting flight service the showsmovies were a mix of arabic and english as was the audio channels x2 english only all flights left and arrived on time the area i found a bit inconsistent was the cabin crew on some flights the crew were attentive and knew what they were doing by contrast on other sectors the cabin crew had an i dont know attitude of particular concern was on the flight out of saw whereby the safety demonstration was still being played on the ife as the plane took off cant blame the pilots here but begs the question as to what an earth the cabin crew were doing for a young airline they have an excellent product but need to make their service a bit more consistent the product comfort in terms of seats and ife are amongst the best ive seen on any narrow body aircraft and provided they keep the prices low id highly recommend them
18714,south african airways,2,dont care about customers,saa is randomly putting me and my wife in terrible seats even if i have previously booked my seats its my fifth trip with saa this year 4 from and to sao paulo and johannesburg and today we are flying from jnb to mauritius and the same situation happened again they just dont care about customers if the flight is empty they just cancel the flight and put the customers from 2 or 3 empty flights in one full flight giving random seats to me and my wife and you just say that flight is full i was previously checked in seats 14d and 14e which was 3rd row in the aircraft map and my new boarding pass is row 71 because the computer randomly put me in row 47 in between 2 other people and the excuse is the same that the flight was cancelled but you can check same flight number in both boarding passes it is not the first time and the other times were far worse because when we buy from partner airlines you dont even give the option to choose the seat even if you call saa or the partner airline
20721,tigerair australia,6,the seats are okay,melbourne to sydney found that the journey was not as bad as people said it would be checkin was smooth even though we didnt do it online the ground staff were okay i found that both flights including the return were not delayed or held back a long time the maximum time we were on the ground was approx 1520mins after boarding the seats are okay theyre fine for shortdistance trips but it can get squashy as the seats are very close together horizontally and vertically the attendants seemed as if they didnt want to be there they were nice enough to handle but werent all smiles i didnt purchase any food
9516,firefly,2,not use this airline again,i have flown with firefly in the past and rated them very highly however during my most recent trip from penang to krabi my suitcase was badly damaged during the flight and can no longer be used i reported the problem upon retrieving the suitcase at krabi airport and completed the complaint form the staff who dealt with the matter promised that firefly would contact me to arrange reimbursement but no one has been in touch and nearly a month later no one from fireflys head office has had the courtesy to respond to any of my emails will not use this airline again
19658,tam airlines,4,3x4x3 layout very tight,i flew tam airlines from so paulo guarulhos to frankfurt on a boeing 77300er and i must say is torture the seats are very tight tam uses the 3x4x3 layout which leaves very tight aircraft the seats are bad just recline the service is also poor and with little food
23034,xl airways france,7,pay for extra legroom seat,flew new york jfk to paris cdg in may 2015 i would fly them again but take my advice and pay the extra 50 for an extra legroom seat for the amount of money you save by flying xl airways over the competitors the 50 is a worthy splurge both flights were on time fare was a steal at 700 i havent seen anything this cheap in years staff was extremely professional both in flight and gate staff plane was in good condition tiny seats i am 53 and didnt have too much problem however my boyfriend is 60 and was miserable the passenger in front reclined his seat and was basically sitting in my boyfriends lap for 7 hours their website is horrible after the first leg of my trip i wised up and was trying to reserve extra legroom seats on the website but kept getting error messages and ultimately was not able to this was absolutely infuriating after all those errors on the website i tried to call their customer service for help but only got voicemail absolutely infuriating good luck if you need any help after you book no inflight entertainment the power outlet at our seats worked only intermittently make every effort to charge your devices before boarding the plane
18286,singapore airlines,7,crew really are the highlight,overall an ok flight lounge silverkris changi is huge and was too over crowded we had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable we only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes way too busy gateboarding we got in line was told there was no point as it hadnt opened we stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority seat narrow overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing others had to help no other storage except under the foot rest there is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones menu and water bottle were kept not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room hard being a side sleeper food as all my other flights had poor quality food i opted for no meal just sleep the passenger in front argued with the fa over no breakfast service personally i believe there should have been a choice but no the lovely fa verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when i woke which was lovely of her as i woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised on arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line overall the crew really are the highlight with singapore airlines the rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident also disappointed that when i booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350900 medium haul
21399,united airlines,8,a decent experience,considering united tends to use their oldest equipment on this route i had a decent experience the usual technical delay broken pa system delayed us 30 minutes aircraft has 222 seating with flat bed style seats the food was ok the service also ok and the entertainment was quite good luggage came quickly and in good shape seems like they are trying to improve

9811,flydubai,4,i am very unhappy with this flight,i am very unhappy with this flight i paid almost 2000 dhs for a short trip they served the food until the middle of the plane and after that they said there was no option to choose a meal and also they served coffee to the first 5 or 6 rows and stopped and they said it is for your safety this is not comparable with emirates
15027,niki,9,niki customer review,nice to vienna return flight cost less than 100 euros including luggage was expecting budget airline but pleasantly surprised when drinks and newspapers were offered free of charge was even more surprised when a snack was included service was courteous and efficient embraer e175 was new and airy compared to similar aircraft regular updates from the cockpit all in all a class act and not sure how they make any profit
12887,klm royal dutch airlines,4,experience is very disappointing,klm has a 2x2x2 configuration in business class this means you have to wake your neighbor up in order to use the bathroom that doesnt really work in business class moreover the power outlets and the headphones ports are located behind your seat which makes it basically impossible to reach as a matter of fact every time you move your headphones are disconnected as theyre not really plugged in merely laying on a magnetic surface the planes are ancient and the experience is honestly very disappointing lots of screaming kids onboard this didnt feel like a business class flight at all
14633,martinair,4,martinair customer review,my husband and i travelled with our two granddaughters from newcastle to orlando via amsterdam klm newcastle to amsterdam and then martinair from amsterdam to orlando we upgraded to comfort class and had very pleasant flights on time the crew on all flights were very nice and helpful their prices are very competitive and again we found no fault whatsoever
8668,emirates,8,lets see if the consistency improves,what a difference a crew makes flight from dubai was staffed by a really engaging crew for whom nothing was too much trouble seat was comfortable but you can tell this was one of the older a380 as part were looking a bit worse for wear food on this flight was among some of the best i have ever had lounge was busy but to be fair we sat close to the gate and didnt venture in boarding was separate to economy however we still had to wait 10 min even though when we tried it was already 10 min past the boarding time got the two return legs to go lets see if the consistency improves
4882,avelo airlines,9,i would use them again,avelo is new to wilmington de avelo did an awesome job with leaving and getting there on time both ways sent out text for checking in checking in a checked bag went well with no issues paid for a carry on for meds swim suitchange of clothes also took a small back pack for the ipad book snacks that fit under the seat no snacks offered but a small bottle of water if you ask for it lead flight attendant did an awesome job getting a few people in line who kept getting up when the seat belt sign was on i would use them again both ways they had a new flight attendant and they were very nice working with her to get her qualified now the wilmington airport is a different story it is a small airport where you get onoff on the tarmac which is no big deal on the return flight home there was another avelo plane a that just landed when you walked into the area to get you baggage it was jammed pack with people 2 door slide up and bags where placed through the opening with everyone trying to see their bag 2 planes worth of people what a mess it took 45 minutes by the time we were off the plane until we got our luggage at one point they were loading stuff from one cart to another it would of been easier if they did not have 2 planes unloading at the same time yes we would fly with them again just have to have patience at wilmington de airport
21790,virgin america,4,ground staff was unpleasant,first return flight with virgin america from new york jfk to san francisco announced delay of 130hrs due the weather but the weather at sfo is 10mph wind with rain and other flights are taking off to there when i gently asked the ground staff whats the issue and to tell me about the weather impact on our flight schedule she was unpleasant not willing to talk about the topic this gives me the feeling that this company is not honest with passengers
5673,blue air,3,ridiculous service and website,barcelona to bucharest ridiculous service and website i tried 5 times with 5 different cards to pay for a checked in luggage and it was saying there is a mistake the mistake was coming from their website after struggling for two days i gave up on the idea and i took a small luggage upon boarding of the plane i was stopped for having my luggage and a computer bag after almost breaking my computer i had to carry all of my things in my hands and only put the bag itself in the luggage the result is the plane was full with little things everywhere jackets cables computers chargers just because the staff was so against the concept of a bag purse bag not a big one it was so annoying and frustrating to make the whole experience better for the passengers the music playing in the plane while we waited to board was some intense folklore rhythm that made the situation even more tense
23015,xl airways france,6,it was better than i was expecting,punta cana to paris i was sceptical of this airline having read the reviews but there was a limited choice when booking airlines overall it was better than i was expecting the plane was tidy although showing its age a bit good news was there was power at the seat bad the seats are not very comfortable especially for a long haul flight ok for a day flight but not for a night flight there is a wifi entertainment system where you can watch entertainment see info about destinations which does not have any use due to the limited information and flight tracking of course there is an upgraded option available for 10 eur food was very average drink options good but have to pay free tea coffee and water the later being freely available and the cabin crew visited the cabin regularly to top up be aware the checkin ques were bad so give yourself plenty of time also carry on luggage has a max weight of 5kg with it being checked a lot of the time
6569,cathay dragon,5,general sense of downgrading,hong kong to kuala lumpur cathay pacific is no longer flying to kuala lumpur and is replaced by its regional recently rebranded cathay dragon previously dragonair i must there is general sense of downgrading in terms of food quality inflight service the mains were really poor in portions and quality and no plain water offered unless you asked for it reminded me of budget airlines like airasia i have always flown cathay pacific business class but this time round decided to try out the economy on cathay dragon and the difference is pretty obvious cabin crew were not as attentive and seemed to rush through their rounds i will consider mas in my next trip
3050,air transat,3,options plus is not not worth one dime,paying for options plus is a scam you supposedly changed the rules of what you receive as a plus in toronto i was registering in economy and not options plus as no one was there for a flight that was leaving for 9am i was told to go to gate c2 for boarding my partner and i sat there for 2 hours and no one said that the gate was changed luckily we started to notice no one at our gate and checked the screen oh yes gate got changed there was no announcement what i am most shocked about is that on top of the fee that i was charged options plus i still had to pay another fee for seat selection in the past everything was included under options plus so im in the plane now and then find out that you dont get a meal with options plus or any of the other amenities any longer well let me tell you for the fee that you charged me for options plus is not not worth one dime now im in punta cana coming home and again it didnt matter if i was under options plus i could have been in the lineup for economy so the only benefit i found when you pay for options plus is that you get your baggage first thats it in total for 2 ppl 31600 was charged i have been flying with air transat since about 20082009 and this is now the last time in addition while staying at the bahia principe in punta cana and 3 days before we were returning to canada we could not locate the air transat rep to find out when the bus was picking us up for the airport all the other airline reps were there everyday except her representing air transat when she did finally show up she was rude that we were making her accountable for not being around then in speaking with the other ppl taking the same flight as us they had made comments that they couldnt find air transat rep at the same resort we were at anyway it is my fault for not checking that the amenities that were included under options plus no longer exists and i feel that i got so ripped off
3515,airasia zest,5,airasia zest customer review,mnlbcd return you get what you pay for we got the early morning flight to bacolod only to find out the flight was cancelled had to go back home for the afternoon flight same thing with our return flight to manila morning flight out of bacolod cancelled hotel staff at bacolod informed us it is a usual occurrence such a big inconvenience if your vacation time is limited or you have to catch a connecting flight would rather fly with cebu pacific or air philippines
10841,hainan airlines,3,not booked with their official site,shanghai to brussels return check in at pvg is smooth and quick hu uses airport lounge at pvg and everything is fine the b789 is brand new and cabin is spacious and clean everything goes fine food is tasteful and good quality wines are offered service is attentive and professional the flat seat is designed ridiculously the end part of both footrest and seat are without any support the wifi is totally unusable on the return flight when asking for wine refill i was told that they only have one bottle of wine as the beverage was not loaded properly the most frustrating thing goes to its online service the ticket was booked on wwwhainanairlinescom which is hu international website but when i talked to its call centre to book airport pickup i was told that ticket was not booked with their official site and i was put on hold for quite long time before they could be able to find my ticket and get access to it then i realized that they have 2 isolated online system their online service team only supports their chinese website wwwhnaircom after 3 weeks of my flight no award or status miles are written to my mileage account i booked another ticket and which was cancelled within 24 hours after booking which is refundable according to their booking and fare rules but 5 weeks after cancellation refund was not returned to my credit card i have called their service centre where i was informed that refund process might take up to 20 working days i have waited for more than 25 working days already
4409,ana all nippon airways,6,found the leg room was excellent,tokyo to perth we found the leg room was excellent even though take off was delayed by 30 minutes on the ground at tokyo due to earlier fog at narita the pilot managed to make up time during the 95 hour flight and arrive on time in perth we felt the food provided was not as good as it could have been the first meal is served within 2 hours of taking off it was a passable chicken dish with side dishes of yoghurt salad and ice cream the second meal is a snack and is served within 2 hours of landing out of australia the snack was fine something like a ham and cheese croissant but out of tokyo the snack was an open sandwich with an inexplicable ton of mayonnaise plus vegetables corn i found it horrible the entertainment options had some recent hollywood movies to choose from not much choice apart from that the tv shows and documentaries were poor or non existent ana needs to up their game in ife the ife user interface was difficult for me to use and the cabin announcements were far too quiet i could not hear 90 of what the captain and crew announced during the flight i probably will not fly ana again
3341,airasia philippines,2,decided to cancel my flight,second time i have flown with airasia philippines reason being the flight time was ideal for my connection coming in from london it gave me 2 hours to transfer from term 1 in manila to term 4 well thats what i thought until air asia decided to cancel my flight and transfer me to a flight some 7 hours later with no explanation upon checking in no apology was given however my blood shot did cause a stir i explained it was a burst blood vessel which was confirmed by my doctor in the uk the member of staff on check in told me to wait as she needed to consult her supervisor i was told by the supervisor i needed to see a doctor who was based at the airport i tried to explain but he wasnt having any of it it was either i saw the doctor or i wasnt be allowed to fly eventually i was seen firstly by a nurse who took my blood pressure asked me a number of questions about my eye i did inform her that i was not feeling any discomfort no itching no blurred visor infact nothing at all even telling them i had flown some 7000 miles for 15 hours from london with no problem the doctor as soon as she arrived said it was ok for me to fly if i sign an indemnity after all that i asked why they were so interested in my eye yet no tests questions were ask regarding covid no answer once on board all was ok i am not a mask wearer as this is not required at home i know when in roam but within the airport on the plane i was never asked to wear one
484,aerolineas argentinas,7,aerolineas argentinas customer review,flew on oct 21st from ezeiza to miami on ar 1304 equipment was airbus 330200 traveled in business class seat 5d check in service was very friendly and efficient business class lounge was spacious and comfortable and serviced by attentive staff boarding was very good and through a separate jet way from other cabin welcome on board was very friendly and helpful seats are flat but at an angle very uncomfortable and i kept on sliding downwards inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video unfortunately the only wc in business class was out of order so we had to use filthy economy class lavatories not good
15019,niki,8,niki customer review,cphvienna return over the christmas holiday the plane and cabin was simple but comfortable flight attendants were cheerful and polite and information from the cockpit was good they gave us a complimentary sandwich and drink which many of the major european airlines do not do anymore we were able to check one bag for free all of this for 110 euros per person
20530,tigerair,1,online checkin was unavailable,i booked tickets from narita to taipei i flew into narita from the us an airport employee told us to go through the transfer gates for our connecting flight we showed up at the gate an hour and a half before boarding the employee refused to print out our tickets and let us board he said that we had to go through customs and checkin at the counter outside this was not stated on our tickets and we tried to checkin online but the tigerair manager working there said the online checkin was unavailable due to covid we had to book a different airline and tigerair refused to give us our tickets or money back
1618,air europa,5,the service was very poor,i flew in december to london to bogota in business class the staff was amazing and food and all the others service was excellent but i return on friday arriving yesterday afternoon to london in economy class and the service was very poor we were offered just one meal in the night of the departure and for the rest of the trip we had to paid the other meal as i know the other airlines are offering two meals when the journey is long making us to pay the other meal and we have to pay for the headphones while other airlines offer this service free
17990,sichuan airlines,3,smelled cigarette smoke,chengdu to hong kong i liked the staff but twice i smelled cigarette smoke i complained and the staff did nothing about it she just explained it away saying it comes from the outside while on the tarmac the second incidence occurred while in flight
21677,vietnam airlines,7,consistent classic and roomy product,bangkoksaigonhue close to new year 2023 both flights on a321 both flights hour delayed which is acceptable on a last friday prior to new year checkin in bangkok not very professional could not communicate well did not know african cities could not retrieve info of my luggage from previous flights however in the end i got my business class privileges incl fast track for security and enjoyed the miracle which is a 3rd party quite disappointing lounge lounge provided in sgn domestic was the le saigonnais which had good food and only soft drinks luggage arrived perfectly on both destinations had to collect it and check it in again in saigon due to the international arrival from bangkok to the domestic next flight on board i found a traditional ample business class seating fastaff were courteous caring and very attentive on both flights i had amble space with pleasant wide large seats in a 2 x 2 configuration 4 rows less than half of the 16 seats were taken wet towels provided likewise welcome drinks as for food i got the verbal choice no menu of hot and cold snacks and drinks appropriate for short flights asked on both flights if i cared for more food and drinks table cloth steel cutlery and proper glasses were provided champagne is not any longer served on regional flights only wine the white wine was completely undrinkable a cheap french sauvignon which is unsellable in europe but vn seems pleased to have made a good deal by paying for garbage feeding their passengers with substandard toxic drinks 24 vietnamese beers were offered also on the domestic leg ife is on shared monitors with vn inspired programme of agriculture tourism and culture no sound unless you use own headsets call bell answered with seconds overall a consistent classic and roomy product
15925,peruvian airlines,2,dont want to pay us back,we had a delay for 5 hours with the excuse of bad weather at lima but when we where flying back from cusco they cancelled our flight because of the bad weather meanwhile lan and avianca were operating normally apparently peruvian airlines doesnt have a sofisticated gps system that its used for landing when there is fog so thats the reason why they always have problems with bad weather we had to buy new tickets with lan because peruvian told us that we can be stuck in cusco for a minimun of 2 more days until they can get us space on a flight we had our flight back to cr so we couldnt wait of course they dont want to pay us back the tickets because they dont refund bad weather issues
16826,rossiya airlines,4,an underwhelming experience,moscow to petropavlovsk needing to go to kamchatka for work i decided to pay for business class as i didnt fancy the 8hour flight from moscow in economy nominally part of aeroflot rossiya airlines is nevertheless far from an equal to its mother company and i was disappointed when i realised that the flight was operated by ra as i have come to esteem aeroflot on longhaul routes in both business and economy online check in was easy and baggage drop was handled at berlin tegel by utair who flew me the first leg on arrival at moscows vnukovo airport i went to the pretty decent rossiya airlines lounge where i used the wireless had a coffee and ate some fruit before going to board business class passengers both of us had a small shuttle to the plane which allowed us at least to skip the crowded main bus the plane itself was freshly painted with a gorgeous mural of an amur leopards face plastered over the nose which looked amazing inside however the cabin was quite aged but the welcome was warm one stewardess spoke english well and i was glad that the business cabin was empty the stewardess informed me that the entire planes entertainment system was not working as if she was letting me know that one of the meal options was unavailable she seemed totally unbothered by this and while of course i was prepared with my laptop and a bunch of series this seemed really poor and i would have been furious had i be flying west and wasnt intending to sleep a meal was served promptly after take off salmon rice and vegetables salad and a dessert that was of the standard youd expect on a medium quality european airlines economy section and then i went to sleep the business seats recline fairly well to around 80 and were fairly comfortable meaning i got at least 6 hours of shut eye which was the main point of flying business a meaty breakfast and undrinkable coffee were served over the volcanoes of kamchatka the following morning before touching down in petropavlovsk definitely an underwhelming experience next time i will try to ensure i fly with aeroflot proper rather than one of its subsidiaries but overall i got what i paid for
16683,regional express,8,thank you for refunding my ticket,thank you to rex airlines for refunding my ticket which was nearly 12 months old that was cancelled due to covid closedown i had not realised that this facility was available and when i approached rex they informed me they would refund the money thanks so much
5133,azerbaijan airlines,3,azerbaijan airlines customer review,my worst flying experience in 11 years of former soviet union travel on january 13 2008 the airport in baku was closed because the airport is not equipped with any modern snow cleaning equipment personnel checking us in in tblissi in georgia without telling us anything with a delay of 7 hours in order to not let us return the tickets and book an alternative route through kiev no food no drinks no apologizing arriving in baku after midnight no information whatsoever a crowded airport without any modern facilities no airport representative ever turned up no food no drinks no apologizing finally with a delay of another 17 hours checkin at the departure lounge we were forced to wait for 2 hours without being allowed to go out and use the toilet aggressive unfriendly personnel at the airport the aircraft was covered with snow no cleaning equipment was at hand to clean away the snow from the top of the aircraft other passengers told us they already had similar experiences when flying from moscow through baku stay away from azerbaijan airlines if you can
22267,vlm airlines,8,offered reasonable prices,work required me to go on very short notice to london so i decided to fly with vlm which offers you three flights per day from antwerp to london city with their fokker 50 decided as well to fly from antwerp as they offered reasonable prices for their flights while my usual airlines i usually take from amsterdam or rotterdam were extremely expensive for just flying of less than a hour arriving a touch early at antwerp airport checkin and security were quite quiet so it was just a matter of a few minutes to pass both checkin and security while waiting to board very small airport so dont expect much to do after security once the aircraft was ready to board it was just 15 minutes to be fully ready to start up and depart the fokker 50 they were using was surprisingly neat and clean from the inside for an aircraft of this age and was quite spacious to stand in the aisle after an ontime departure out of antwerp the flight was quite smooth and the flight attendant started to serve us with a complimentary drink and snack of your choosing while the flight crew kept us up to date about their procedure into london city and the estimated time of arrival which to me was well done turbulence appeared into approach of london and landing was ontime the most surprising factor of the flight was that the noise was quite low for a turboprop within the cabin after a ontime landing the boarding was quickly done in a safe and mannerly matter and all that was left was to wait for our luggage to arrive on our belt which probably was the longest wait
11981,jet airways,1,never use it again,i booked my ticket and received an email saying that the flight cancelled and need change the flight for onward journey then i had to change my coach by paying 12 extra after my onward journey they send another email that my return flight cancelled from cochin to london and they have no option for me they said they will pay half of the price and cancelled my ticket i paid 293 for my return journey with other airline and paid another 15 for change coach total i paid 320 extra and today jet airways send me an email saying they will pay me only 140 i lost 180 for their faults i am an etihad silver card member always use jet airways but never use it again they show cheap price and later make you pay more
23169,zipair,6,it was immaculately clean,zipair is jals budget airline they dont have classes of travel you just pick your seat flat bed emergency exit etc and pay accordingly we usually travel ba or jal business class this trip was last minute and jal business was going to cost 8k instead we paid just over 25k to fly with zipair in their fully flat seats your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage and they do weigh rucksackshandbags etc a bottle of water and the seat you booked check in process was not good of course we arent used to queuing for check in but here everyone queues there is no advanced passenger information loaded so with covid added the check in process was long also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold you can pay to add a bag to the hold but you cant pay for additional cabin baggage they are strict on weight to the gram we were also asked if we had a return ticket which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2 in fact i was sat behind and to the right of my husband this was pointed out to us at checkin but we werent allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin seats must be booked at least 24 hours before checkin and again this is enforced strictly we couldnt even change seats on board although the seat on my husbands left was free the fully flat bed was nearly as good as jalba business class not quite so much storage includes reading light table and some storage space you can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for takeoff and landing an improvement on the new ba business class seats its quite hard but otherwise good it was immaculately clean again better than ba cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe there is no entertainment screen wifi is included free of charge and a very small selection of films is available the fully flat seat has a usb charging point fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and qi code the onboard shop opens about an hour after takeoff and closes about an hour before landing otherwise meals must be booked in advance prebooked meals are served before the onboard shop is open so you cant buy a drink until after your meal cushions and blankets are not included but can be bought from the online shop in deciding whether to use zipair you need to compare cost to convenience if you have time to download movies book seats in advance there is no app to make this easy preorder meals and to bring your own pre and withmeal drinks that will help also to bring your own cushionblanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board for me some of the joy was missing there wasnt enough mealentertainmentshopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping is that worth 55k only you can answer that
8978,etihad airways,4,did not provide me any room for stopover,it was mentioned on etihad airways that they will provide accomodation for stopover of more than 10 hours my stopover was around 23 hrs but etihad said they dont have any rooms left they did not provide me any room for stopover and said no rooms available for your dates i was trying to book room about 4 months ago i booked the room in abu dhabi airport hotel and interestingly it was the same hotel etihad airways told me that there are no rooms left they lied to me i dont recommend to travel with etihad if you have stopover of more than 23 hours
21070,tuifly,5,tuifly customer review,tel aviv to berlin tegel airport easy checkin friendly staff loads of leg room we had normal seats not exit seats food was nothing to write home about but it was a night flight so didnt really care plane was clean would recommend and will be flying with them again great prices available
14377,mahan air,8,mahan air customer review,flew on a very large a340600 in business class the checkin was organized and the fast track provided was helpful in bypassing the very long immigrationsecurity lines they used the thai airways lounge which was fantastic boarding was via a bus and despite the airlines effort was not too comfortable i found the flight attendants to be attentive and polite plenty of food and nonalcoholic drinks and natural juices the on board lounge was a nice experience and i enjoyed the iranian treats the business class seat was full flat with mattress and a nice blanket which improved the sleep quality when compared with other aircraft i have flown a nice snack before our early morning arrival into tehran overall a pleasant flight
696,air algerie,7,air algerie customer review,frankfurt to annaba this summer return the age of the plane from ffm to alger was pretty old the alger annaba flight the same on the return both planes were new there was no delay service on the ground and onboard is ok food was excellent even during ramadan take care at the airport especially on the way from the international to the domestic airport in alger dont give anybody your papers except if you are sure they are really officials
3484,airasia x,7,flight was not that full,auckland to kuala lumpur with a short stopover at gold coast the flight was not that full and the plane was able to depart 5 minutes early the flight was smooth all the way until a few hours before landing turbulence was evident but the captain was able to minimise it this time the food that i ordered roast chicken with stuffing and cranberry gravy was really dry and the accompanying vegetables were unpalatable landing at kul was a bit bumpy
6766,cebu pacific,7,they could improve the website,solid airline for locals i avoided it until they had a very good prices to fly domestically however felt the warm flight staff seats arent as small as other domestic flights i am very happy with the flight itself i think what they could improve on is the website side and helping people claim their vouchers
15865,pegasus airlines,4,no online checkin in english,there is no online checkin website in english mobile application wont download once completed they do not issue or send you the boarding pass automatically but you need to do several other further steps to have it forwarded to your email or phone all in turkish thats incomprehensible flight crew was courteous on the flight to bishkek and the flight was nice
6064,british airways,4,all in all very disappointing,my husband and i booked seats within our premium economy booking on both outward journey ba015 on 12 february and return on 11 march we were last or almost last to be served food each time they had run out of our choices on one occasion i did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me on all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curryspicy food all in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of british airways
12170,jetairfly,4,my last trip on jetairfly,i have travelled with jetairfly about 8 times every time there were some issues most of the time involving my reserved seats that they unannounced changed very uncomfortable and no refund given every time they had a minimum delay of 25hrs the longest delay 5 hours all leaving from miami they did not announce this at any time desk people never gave correct answers i live 90 minutes from the airport they could have warned me by email every time i say this will be my last time but it is convenient for me because of the nonstop to brusselsmiami today i have a bigger issue with them i need to take my support dog with me and am not able to reach them by phone from usa neither they dont want to give an email address on top of all of it they raised their price 200 one way since last year it definetly will be my last trip on jetairfly
9251,ravn alaska,4,never be using ravn again,ravn alaska is so frustrating first off your carryon items will all pretty much have to be checked unless theyre tiny so my husband and i shortchecked our carryon bags to our next airline since the next airline we transferred to would have enough room to stow them overhead then we took this tiny 19seater plane which once boarding was finished started up the engines only to have them shut off three times before the stewardess announced something is wrong the pilots are going to try fix it thats comforting and gave out cookies to passengers to shift focus finally we were told by the pilots that there was a technical issue that could be deferred for now and once they get paperwork done then we can take off at one point early on we were told it would be about 15 more minutes then about half an hour later they said itll be about 10 more minutes until takeoff overall we were delayed in the plane sitting there prerunway for an hour and our next layover was 1 hr 20 min so when we arrived at the next airport we had literally 10 minutes until the next plane terminal would close the gate to deplane get our bags from baggage claim go through security and run to our next gate upon deplaning we asked the ground crew if we could just grab our shortchecked bags right there on the tarmac they said no we were told the baggage claim was close by which it wasnt my husband and i ran not a good idea when youre 7 months pregnant and not a runner by nature he ran to baggage claim to get our bags while i ran to our next gate to try keep the door open until my husband arrived with our bags as soon as i arrived i was told to get onboard right now and when i begged them to wait just a couple minutes for my husband who was running up as we spoke they said they could not and closed the door right in front of me thanks a lot ravn for making us shortcheck our appropriately sized carryons having technically unsound planes being untruthful about how much more time wed be delayed on the tarmac not letting us grab our shortchecked bags after deplaning and not apparently notifying the next gate that multiple passengers including us were delayed and on their way running to he gate it ruined our night and our trip home and we felt so ripped off by this airline we will certainly never be using ravn again and have let our friends know to avoid this airline as well
16121,play,2,customer service was very poor,overall play assistance and customer service was very poor in boston the assistance at the boarding gate was unprofessional play needed to arrive earlier they needed to announce what the expectations more clearly before all the confusion began passengers who did not have a red tag on their personal item and carryon needed to bring them up to the desk then people were charged 90 for bags that they normally can bring on other airlines as a carryon the play personnel kept leaving the desk passenger became anxious and kept cutting in line to be the next person served no orderly process getting a boarding pass on myplay was extremely difficult several people asked us if we had as much trouble as they did the site would need to be accessed several times it finally worked for the trip from boston to keflavik but not visa versa i was confused when it asked if i had a check in bag etc i paid for it already fortunately i was able to go back on the site and confirm my bag status the boarding pass final step didnt provide a pass a popup was shown but i didnt get to read it one person should have been available at the play desk in keflavik we were not even sure it was the service desk until security helped us people want to move on and get through security also at keflavik we took a bus to the airplane the priority people didnt get bused separately so they were just mixed in with the crowd entering the plane again unorganized in general the other parts of the trip were good we left on time and arrived early the plane staffs was good and icelandic staff the checked bags arrived quickly
13641,lc per,9,without any complications,i flow with lc per from lima to cuzco and back service onboard was perfect legroom okay crew very friendly and professional and both flights on time i also booked a flight to the north cost of peru with lc per unfortunately they canceled this route giving me an alternative flight with another airline lan also giving me the possibility to notice that lc is by far better than lan now latam but the servie of rebooking paying far more for the new ticket than i paid for the lc flight was quite good and surprisingly without any complications
5809,blue1,4,blue1 customer review,helcph rj85100 clean quiet i like these aircraft good crew good service flight crew kept us informed about our journey routing and expected time of arrival no complaints
7788,csa czech airlines,3,flight time is just a concept,nice to prague from early in the morning one hour and twenty minutes of delay it seems like the new standard for this airline as it is one of the so many this year ok used to be a fairly good company but now flight time is just a concept and connecting in prague is like playing at the lottery hoping you will get the winning ticket
19373,sunwing airlines,2,awful awful awful experience,cancun to toronto with sunwing airlines awful awful awful experience major delays on both ends of travel pick up from hotel was over an hour late more than an hour to get luggage back when at pearson never fly with this airline so terrible
10070,french bee,7,very nice crew,san francisco to paris got to the airport 3 hours early and when the counter opened i checked my bag and even though a little over on weight said it was not a problem the seating was tight but not nasty small im 511 and weigh 210lbs plane was new and clean with no nasty odors all seats had a small blue blanket in plastic packaging the inflight entertainment was good with menu choices from using your laptopphone to output video on your screen to cameras on the nose and tail to see where you are going to a choice of about 30 movies plus a few tv programs still not too shabby for the 18000 seat price you also can order duty free stuff and also munchies from the video screen menu chips are 2 eu and you can buy 2 small bottles of jack daniels and 2 chips for 1000 but no different from other airlines these days the flight was good and bathrooms were clean the cabin crew spoke mostly french but were fine by the end of 11 hours the seats were feeling a little bit hard just keep in mind that i think most folks miss especially those who have flown to europe before this is not a 2000 flight its basically a nice clean seat on a bus bring snacks or a sandwich with you along with a neck pillow i even had the chance to talk to the flight crew including the pilot who was from madrid very nice crew
2876,air seychelles,6,air seychelles customer review,cdgsezcdg overall average airline that left me with mixed feelings outward flight delayed by 2 hours due to technical failure with chaotic or no information given af staff and aeroport de paris are responsible inward flight was on time smily and efficient crew on outward flight versus grumpy and unfriendly crew on inward flight on both flights business class seats show their age and very old concept no lie flat no electrical control ife is a joke not on demand personal screens show only two channels but crew can provide on request some dvd like personal readers with a limited choice 5 movies that are on demand aircraft are old but food choice of international and creole and wines 1 champagne 2 red and 2 white wines were good with a nice service of cheese and desserts unfortunately absolutely no service between meals on inward day flight beverages had to be negotiated with crew in the galley lounges good but af at cdg to sum up decent aircraft with modern cabins are needed and some cabin crew need to improve their attitude
1281,air canada rouge,8,crew were professional friendly and accommodating,i have to say having flown air canada rouge a handful of times international transborder i havent had a negative experience with their premium rouge business class product the latest flight was a return leg from montego bay ac1805 to toronto the aircraft was two years old and extremely clean obviously crew were professional friendly and accommodating fb quality and service was excellent a very pleasant travel experience during very trying times
16348,qantas airways,3,not where it previously was,the overall qantas business product is not where it previously was having taken the same flight down with virgin business it is interesting comparing the two products virgin was overall a better product qantas check in at canberra cbr could not even see dedicated business check in and used the general boarding machines qantas lounge is comfortable but no dedicated business lounge in cbr just one shared with qantas club at time of boarding they just called the flight so no priority for business or premium ff members on the plane we were only offered water prior to the flight the plane was comfortable and the seating was good the meal was good overall but we were not offered any refills or a second beverage basically the attendant seemed to be looking at herself in her phone screen over providing service following service my empty water bottle and napkin clearly was visible in the front seat pocked but was never cleaned up even though there was plenty of time on completion of the lunch service finally the bags well again no business priority the bag came out amongst all the general baggage being a premium ff the premium baggage service has been nonexistent since qantas moved to contractors
20461,thomson airways,2,no smiles or kind words,trip to jamaica on 21st may from manchester with thomson boarded on time but an issue with seating in the economy cabin delayed us on the tarmac for an hour cabin crew were trying to sit a woman next to her child the passenger was not cooperating and the cabin crew didnt handle it well when we were finally in the air all of the crew were obviously not happy with what had happened and proceeded to take it out on all of us poor passengers no smiles or kind words scared to even ask for another drink the captain was good at keeping us informed though on the return journey crew were slightly better but as it was a night flight didnt see them much same issue on way back with seating but thankfully we werent delayed inflight entertainment was rubbish to say the least and 9 hours with nothing good to watch was not fun will try another company next time
1309,air canada rouge,1,outstanding customer service,i would like to express my gratitude for some outstanding customer service i experienced from ground crew from las vegas to vancouver i am an 80 plusyearold lady that was not looking forward to all of the walking and stress of going through customs when we reached vancouver i was blown away with the attentive ground staff that whisked me through customs and made it so enjoyable and so stressfree thank you so much for your assistance happy thanksgiving to you all

2119,air madagascar,1,air madagascar customer review,i flew economy paristana tanaantsiranana antsirananatana tanaparis in sept and oct 2014 local flights were on 737 nothing special neither bad nor good the intercontinental flight was on an old 340 the fittings were old but ok seating and food ok as well inflight entertainment a little inferior to air france smaller screen not as many choices but then again af also does not use their newest equipment on this route so that the difference is not this big two of the four flights were delayed by several hours one of which was my return flight on oct 6 to paris which was delayed by 35 hours this may become a real problem for anybody requiring a connecting flight as airmad has no codeshare partners in europe with whom one could book a combined ticket hence it cost me about 350 euro to change the reservation for my af connecting flight fortunately it could be changed and air madagascar is not willing to reimburse me referring to the conditions of sale even though airmad told me differently in tana when it became clear that the delay would cause me to miss my connecting flight in paris hence people not living near paris or marseille should take this risk into account after all my so far longest delay on an airmad flight was 13 hours in 2010 hence one should plan on long transfer times to be on the sure side i would not recommend it
22390,volaris,4,standard lowcost carrier experience,they rescheduled the flight to depart 5 hours earlier than id initially booked and didnt even notify me only when checking in online the day before did i notice it had changed communication seems to be a recurring issue with volaris when ive had flights delayed 23 hours in the past even though it shows the delay on their website and in the volaris app they dont send any emailsmspush notification about it their customer service via whatsapp takes hours to respond that being said the bag drop process at mex was surprisingly quick and efficient the cabin crew were nice the flight departed on time seats were okay no recline and not much leg room snacks on board for purchase standard lowcost carrier experience in my opinion
11741,ita airways,2,pathetic experience,this is my experience with ita airways on which i flew today i booked my tickets using ita airways website which showed a connecting flight from new delhiromebarcelona the layover was 50 minutes and my flight from delhi to rome got delayed by 40 minutes we landed at 840 am there was no preference given for unboarding the flight for people whose connecting flight was just 20 minutes hence the flight attendants could not care less there was no one available outside the gate to help us guide for the immediate onboarding for the next flight had the ita attendants been mindful of such urgency which was created due to delays by ita airways so many people would not have missed the flight i was given the next flight which was 5 hours after my missed flight and all that was compensated was a snack meal coupon no lounge services to rest after a 9 hour flight and a long delay in arrangement of the next flight pathetic experience the staff is unconcerned about the customers
3576,airbaltic,2,why so cheap,tallinn to milan i was dreading flying with it for a cause i was forced to fly with it why so cheap no normal beverages or food on the plane and then you have to pay 60 euros even if youve paid for your carryon luggage why do you have to do it
17020,royal brunei airlines,8,cabin attendants polite and welcoming,flew bangkok to melbourne via brunei with royal brunei both flights departed and arrived on time the check in in bangkok was efficient and polite and was able to use the priority lane for security check and immigration i boarded both flights at leisure and given priority in boarding bangkok to brunei the cabin was lightly loaded and i was given an ipad with some films on it i was reading a book so did not see what was available the seat recline was adequate and was comfortable from brunei to melbourne the cabin was completely full and the seat fully reclined to a flat bed and was very comfortable the inflight entertainment was adequate but film selection was a bit limited on both flights the quality and quantity of the food was excellent although on the melbourne to bangkok i did not get the main i wanted and decided to use the soup would have been better if it were a bit hotter royal brunei is a dry flight so no alcohol this was a problem on the flight so drink selection is a little limited the cabin attendants on both sectors were courteous friendly and provide excellent service my luggage was one of the first of the flight in melbourne i usually fly twice a year to bangkok with royal brunei and the service quality tends not to vary flights usually depart and arrive on time and the cabin attendants are always polite and welcoming
4472,anadolujet,7,anadolujet customer review,flight antalya to ankara flight on time pleasant air crew passenger given snacks and drinks unfortunately wanted tea but the crew did not have any milk which was disappointing as i have used pegasus and they always have milk for tea
11102,hop,7,wouldnt recommend because of price,strasbourg to amsterdam ridiculous price 550 euro for a oneway flight so a purchased a much cheaper return and canceled the return flight this is supposed to be a lowcost airline inflight service consisted of snack and drink stewardess even returned for me since i was asleep which i appreciated i like the e145 aircraft since it has solo seats wouldnt recommend because of the price only but its your only option on this route
7129,citilink,7,checkin took more time,makassar to surabaya great staff the checkin took more time but not queue the flight are crowded i cant choose the seat my seat is the last seat the cabin crew is nice

15446,oman air,9,i was very happy with everything about this flight,final leg of my trip home to london i was very happy with everything about this flight the food cabin crew seat comfort and punctuality ive had a really great experience with oman air over the last month and really rate them highly my only criticism of oman air is that on this flight i bought one of their overpriced wifi packages as i needed to do some work emails and the wifi is painfully slow whilst i realise at 40000ft i cant expect lightning fast at almost 40 it should be better
11932,jazeera airways,3,jazeera airways customer review,dxbkwidxb on new a320 outbound slightly older a320 inbound on time departure both ways on outbound bus journey to remote parking bay took over 20 minutes a typical dxb problem less than 30 occupancy outbound around 70 inbound ife on flipdown lcd screens one per every three rows pretty uselessboring efficient lcc which does get you from a to b with minimum fuss
3216,airasia,1,canceled due to operational reasons,i bought a ticket through airasia website for a flight on the 21st of august sunday from chiang mai to kuala lumpur i received an email last saturday notifying me that the flight had been canceled due to operational reasons i tried to understand what these reasons were but i could only contact an automated bot i eventually got to talk with a socalled live agent had to wait in queue for 3 hours that pretended he was typing the 3 dots premessage symbol showed up for like 5 minutes and eventually the conversation expired i came to understand that the flight they sold me ak 857 doesnt operate on sundays i have another ticket bought from them for the 25th august thursday from kl to krabi ak 868 and i already checked flightaware and found out that the flight only operates on monday wednesday and friday i asked for a refund for the flight that got cancelled by airasia but so far i havent got my money back and from the looks of it im understanding that the same situation will arise with the kl to krabi flight dont trust airasia flights and always check on several sites if the flights actually exist and operate on the days they are selling them
15163,norse atlantic airways,5,wont be rushing back to fly with norse,i wont be rushing back to fly with norse air again the meals are very small the meals are tasty but quite pricey i had chicken mash the snack before we landed was sorrentina tomato and mozzarella tasty hot but tiny they give you wooden knife fork spoon very hard to cut with their flimsy wooden knife if you dont order a meal you have to pay for tea and coffee normal coffee is 350 usd on the plane they only served drinks twice in 11 hours on the flight from london to los angeles first cup of tea was barely lukewarm coffee was hotter but not hot exit row was empty many passengers asked could they move to the exit row after we got into the flight but they were told only if you pay usd 50 for an upgrade so three seats in the exit row stayed empty the whole 11 hours i thought it was a bit mean movie selection was the best thing about norse i paid extra for an aisle seat in economy not much room got up on my feet every hour to stretch will definitely chose the competition instead of going with norse again they had a big launch for their july london to usa flights but the passengers dont get treated to any luxury also checkin at gatwick was very strange you had to wait to get into the queue for the checkin i overheard passengers being told by checkin staff monitoring the queue to get off their mobile phones when they are in the norse queue very strange indeed you have to preorder pay for the hot food online before you fly you have to pay for a blanket and you have to pay for earphones
11056,hong kong airlines,6,drink and hot snack are served free,hong kong to chengdu hong kong airlines is the low cost hong kong airline owned by hainam airlines it costs 13 flying them compared to cathay pacific so i shall have no complaints the seat pitch is tighter than cathay or other airlines it was a dinner time flight and drink and hot snack are served free no complaints as expectation was not high to be fair
1347,air caraibes,1,absolutely not recommended,vergognoso per risolvere qualunque cosa ti obbligano a chiamare il call center a pagamento e avrete bisogno di loro sempre in quanto nulla pu essere fatto in linea e hanno sempre problemi rilasciano buoni che non possono essere utilizzati online ovviamente devi chiamare il call center mandano link di pagamento che scadono in 2 ore e danno problemi sulla transazione ovviamente devi chiamare il call center assolutamente sconsigliati shameful to resolve anything they force you to call the paid call center and you will always need them as nothing can be done online and they always have problems they issue vouchers that cannot be used online obviously you have to call the call center they send payment links that expire in 2 hours and give problems on the transaction of course you have to call the call center absolutely not recommended
17310,ryanair,7,very good service with lots of smile,return flight zagagpzag in mid march 2023 booking flights on the ryanair app is easy and straightforward very reasonably priced tickets are bought 2 months in advance flights from zag are operated by lauda europe and their a320 in 180 seat config boarding was on time with a bit of queuing the young and very enthusiastic crew offered very good service with lots of smiles both flights were on time onboard products are reasonably priced had just enough leg space i was not touching the seat in front no frills but flights were definitely very good value for money
2965,air tahiti nui,8,air tahiti nui customer review,laxpptlax over christmas and new year both trips were redeyes outbound from lax checkin was cheerful and set the tone for the journey on the down side passengers are bussed to the aircraft and atn staff lost complete control of the process resulting in a scrum to get on the busses onboard we passed on the meal offering and slept the hot breakfast was welcome arrivals hall was chaos and a 1 hour delay to get through immigration awaited us returning the departures area is new spacious but very warm boarding went well as our seats were in row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at lax once again pleasant and efficient crew in summary our flights were good the only warning i would make is that in economy the seat pitch is only 31 inches and on an 8 hour flight if you are over 6 ft tall this is not comfortable at all
14746,meridiana,6,meridiana customer review,milano linatealghero return md82 economy quite old aircraft average service30 mins delay on flight to sardinia this airline clearly needs improvement to offer a higher standard but its ok if you just need to fly from italy to sardinia average crew
2992,air tanzania,5,i could not checkin without it,i traveled last evening 1st nov from dar to mumbai it was a tight schedule since i came from arusha and had to take this 1 hr later connecting flight at 1950 to mumbai tc 2400 within an hour i had to get my bags from the domestic terminal to the international and do the rest of the process to be on my flight back home when i came to the counter i was asked for my air suvidha form unfortunately i wasnt aware and the man behind said i could not checkin without it at this time i had all my documents ready both vaccines done in india a local covid test done at arusha a few hrs before the flight i showed the man behind the counter and he refused to move forward saying i could not leave without the air suvidha form duly filled online i dont know how important this form was since no one from here on asked me for the form neither in the airport at dar nor in mumbai he promptly directed me to 2 tanzanian airline employees and they in a very rude tone told me they could do it but it was not for free they demanded 50000 tanzanian to fill the form for me and i reluctantly paid meanwhile i called me agent who booked the ticket for me and she too got on to the job of filling this online form the counter was kept open since this process was on and the ladies signaled to the counter guy probably indicating that the deal is done and they are on the job im not too sure if the counter staff is a part of this racket but im convinced that he is aware if i had chosen to do this with my agent they would have closed the counter on me i say this cause they already told me the counter is closed and my time was up and i had to miss my flight when i first came to check in the deal with the tanzanian lady staff kept the counter open for me finally my agent filled the form and sent me the completed form before these ladies could do it i showed it to them and they confirmed it was ok and asked me to go to the counter the rest is standard process no one asked me for the form i got into the flight which was delayed for more than hr the ladies didnt return my money even though they didnt do the job that was expected considering the greed and the language they used in my brief conversation with them i have great respect for the people of tanzania and admire the courtesy care and hospitality they exhibit but these minor isseues need to be fixed immediately to avoid damage
14718,meridiana,8,meridiana customer review,gatwick to florence return no problems with checkin staff flight departures or arrivals served a soft drink and crackers on the plane which is all we expected for a short flight
9283,fastjet,9,what a welcome surprise,what a welcome surprise fastjet is giving real competition to kenya airways whose fares are significantly higher for about 80 less we flew them from lilongwe malawi to dar es salaam they departed and arrived on time the plane was new and comfortable yes they charge for additional services but the customer has control of how much beyond the very low fare they want to spend for advance booking more advantageous seating baggage and food even with all the extras our fare remained very low
22979,xiamen airlines,5,most of the crew were pleasant,flew hangzhou to singapore with xiamen airlines for a chinese airline i was rather pleased that the plane departed on time most of the crew were pleasant but one or two stewardess did not have a smile on their faces food was served and was pleasant enough we were also given a packet of nuts and a bottle of water 23 into our flight i wouldnt mind taking this flight again although there was one issue that perplexed me apparently ipads laptops tablets could be used during the flight but mobile phones were not allowed i honestly think this is rather stupid since a mobile phone works just like an ipadtablet the inflight entertainment is but a pathetic small tv that one can barely see what is being shown and only chinese movies were played
18452,skymark airlines,7,comfy seat and legroom,tokyo haneda to sapporo return with skymark airlines first leg on boeing 737800ng new cabin comfy seat and generous legroom for a lowcost airline even though i didnt purchase any the drinks and snakcs are sold at a cheap price departure and arrival on time return leg delayed for 30 mins due to congestion at destination airport return aircraft was an older boeing 737800 very warm cabin temperature but overall worth the ticket price definetely better than airasia and jetstar
18046,silkair,7,the flight was half empty,singapore to kota kinabalu early morning departure flight from singapore flight crew were on their first leg and looked fresh and cheerful going out on the boeing 737800 and the flight was half empty hence was lucky enough to have the side seats free which no doubt contributed to the overall sense of luxury silkair b737s are decked out in an airy light decor but the seats are a little bit spartan with only the dropdown table and a large expanse of plastic moulding which allows you to store any loose items you wish and no doubt forget about them when you depart legroom is adequate if nothing to write home about but certainly bit better than budget airlines while the b737 is always a more width constrained than the a320 pre flight service included face towels disposable packets and offers of newspapers despite a half full flight they had run out of meal choices by the time they reached me but small matter the food was never going to be the reason to fly anyway entertainment was via silkair studio bring your own electronic device and stream via wifi i was slightly amused to see that the music choices hadnt changed at all in the last 6 months though i would guess that the movie options must have changed the biggest downside is the limited toilet capacity at the rear small cramped and if you are on a full flight there will be endless queues not so on this flight though and we landed on time uneventfully
18030,silkair,6,do not expect too much,singapore to penang for this short one hour flight to penang silkair uses the a320 in a 3x3 configuration in economy silkair is the regional branch of singapore airlines a snack of curry puff and a drink was served on this flight i had the exit row so the leg room was generous there is no inflight entertainment you have to download the silkair studio app and stream videos and music on your mobile device so remember to bring along your earphones if you want to use the ife do not expect too much on short regional flights on silkair and you will not be disappointed
7189,cityjet,6,staff were polite and smiling,flew cityjet from dublin to paris boarding was very confusing since both doors of the plane were used but i could not see any information about which rows should use which door apparently no one else saw it either since lots of people tried to pass each other inside once seated everything went smoothly and we arrived on time a sandwich was served but no alternative for us who do not eat gluten coffee was not too bad legroom was almost better than on the connecting air france airbus staff were polite and smiling since this was not a long flight i found it perfectly ok even though the confusion at boarding should be easy to avoid
21161,turkish airlines,3,flights could have been better,extra legroom not possible for over 65 we booked a flight from tashkent to heathrow via istanbul 12 july 2023 i am 197m tall and wanted to pay for extra legroom seat in economy during booking on website the seat selection option flagged that those over 65 cannot book exit row its first time ive encountered this having flown on many other airlines where exit row can be occupied by 16 or older and capable of assisting with evacuation having accepted that turkish and some other airlines set a maximum age i searched the seat plan airbus a330300 and selected extra legroom seats by bulkhead row 11 not shown as an exit row all seemed ok when i completed the booking and paid weeks later i completed the online checkin only possible 24 hours or less before flight which showed our extra legroom seat allocation but when printing boarding passes we discovered we had been allocated seats in row 36 the seat pitch is too small for me and most uncomfortable for 5 hour flight even painful when passenger in front reclines there seems to be an unclear or unreliable booking process please be warned if you are over 65 and require extra legroom then dont book turkish airlines or pay more for business class another comment which might help some travelers if you are transiting in istanbul then make sure your next flight leaves you enough time for transfer our flight from tashkent to istanbul landed 20 mins late it then took an unbelievably long 45 mins to taxi a long way around the airport to hardstanding another 10 mins to disembark aircraft it then took us 30 mins walking at a fast pace through transit and bag scan to next boarding gate where passengers had already started boarding the flights themselves could have been better toilets were not cleaned all rubbish not collected left on floor during landing maps would not load on inflight information screen
19987,thai airasia,5,curious mixture of positives negatives,my flying experience bangkok dmk to singapore with thai airasia was a curious mixture of positives and negatives airasia uses the older don mueang airport to serve bangkok this was convenient for me as it is located quite close to my hotel the rama gardens dmk was considerably more crowded and rundown since the last time i visited when it was bangkoks principal airport the checkin counters are not well identified with signs and i had to wander for a while and ask for guidance before i found the appropriate location the premium flex addon to the low dmksin base fare costs about 30 usd and gives the passenger several priorities including a separate checkin line preferred boarding more comfortable seating a choice of hot meals and 20 kg of luggage once located the checkin process was polite and efficient passport and security checks went reasonably quickly but the terminals air conditioning system didnt seem up to the challenge of the thai sun and the teeming crowds the boarding areas had more windows but with the great views of the active runways came even more heat the boarding process went smoothly i had chosen one of the hot seats the window seat in the forward overwing exit row except for these rows which were empty the flight was completely full i dont know if this is a common feature of a320s but the actual windows in these rows were so clouded with condensation moisture that they were essentially opaque another disappointment associated with these exitrow seats was that passengers in these seats are not allowed to purchase and consume the wine and beer that is sold onboard the hot meal i had preordered was actually quite tasty but it would have been considerably improved with a singha beer or two our departure and arrival were punctual the crew were efficient and courteous and the flight was smooth and uneventful despite the fact that my suitcase had been tagged for priority handling it was the absolute last bag to appear on the luggage carousel several minutes after the last bag sign had appeared given the opportunity i would certainly fly with thai airasia again particularly now that i know the pitfalls to avoid
1634,air europa,2,one of the worst experiences ever,one of the worst experiences ever hardly anything included had to buy even earphones and in march 2020 all flights cancelled for about 6 months so i paid nearly 2000 to get back home with another airline for another 12 months i couldnt ask for a refund and now need to wait 6 months for the refund to be processed
19652,tam airlines,6,fa was friendly and attentive,ground staff of lan was ok not overwhelming nice but ok seats in row 42 ok ife slow and quality ok service of fa was good friendly and attentive quality of food as you can expect in eco we had a transit at gru to scl and had to pass a security check where our water bought at fra was taken strange upon arrival at fra i had a damaged piece of baggage but the ground staff wasnt interested in any way of alpologizing but pointed out the rules for such case only overall nothing special but a decent choice to travel to south america on long haul
7293,cobalt,6,greek language is a must,larnaca to athens my first flight on this new airline based in cyprus the a320 was perfect looked clean and new departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule flight was excellent with a constant updating on the route both in greek and english all in all a great flight but flight attendants did not even speak greek and some passengers had a problem in getting service from the hostess the inflight magazine torn apart and overused was only in english even safety instructions were only in english this airline seems to ignore or avoid the greek language being a low cost airline goodies on sale were at a high price fully recommended as an airline but they should realise that greek language is a must expecially in case of emergency not to mention out of respect
21604,uzbekistan airways,6,uzbekistan airways customer review,if you book your flight in tashkent you get what you pay for basic service that will get you from a to b with no frills however if you book your flight outside of uzbekistan the flight prices are ridiculous i regularly fly lhrtaslhr if i have my ticket booked in tashkent it costs approx 350 return if booked in london costs me about 550 from the airline i take great issue with the check in at heathrow there are 3 check in desks to check in about 300 people many of those 300 speak little or no english which makes the process more prolonged and agonising there is a screen that says tashkent business class check in this isnt used for business class only and even those paying a premium price can expect to wait up to 2 hours to check in boarding is as expected everyone pushes but my experience has been that everyone sits in their allocated seats inflight entertainment is poor seats are comfortable and cleanliness is acceptable staff vary from helpful to uncooperative a bribe can be paid 50100 to cabin crew to sit in business class
6058,british airways,3,arrived at the airport only 1 hour before,we were traveling as a family 5 people because of an accident by the airport we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight the kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to checkin the lady at the checkin checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass because we had no extra time we headed straight to security and didnt realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass not of the passport holder we got stuck in security because of that couldnt figure out what was wrong we only didnt miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party the staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there
1559,air dolomiti,4,air dolomiti customer review,mxpmuc on a bae 146 y class good legroom excellent catering even on such a short flight flight attendants not smiling but doing their job overall a good experience followed by a smooth and easy transit in munich
10443,germanwings,6,germanwings customer review,hamstr ground staff at hamburg were pleasant and everything was swift on ground a319 aircraft on this route was nearly 50 full legroom is acceptable and enough information was given by captain aircraft landed 5 minutes late and i had a tight connection for further travel by train i had checked in a piece of luggage and feared that i miss my train connection but luggage arrive on belts in stuttgart airport very quickly and i did make my connection snacks and drinks onboard are very expensive all in all a good experience for the price paid
6353,canadian north,5,canadian north customer review,flew with canadian north on two occasions found both flights to be very enjoyable first flight was edmonton to norman wells and the next was edmonton to yellowknife found check in staff to be friendly and helpful both times flight attendants were very courteous and friendly no corny jokes unlike westjet meals are also included with the fare for breakfast it was a hot or cold meal for dinner on the way home it was pork or chicken with free wine almost unheard of today on domestic economy flights the airplane was an older 737 but in nice condition and lots of baggage allowance would fly with them again and strongly recommend them
21543,utair aviation,6,utair aviation customer review,i had two short hops between iev and dok planes brand new atr seat pitch is so so no recline overall comfort level was ok they served a snack which looked uninspiring so i skipped it the free bar service only consisted of soft drinks flights out and back were on time considering very reasonable ticket prices will use again for flights up to 2 hours long
11010,hong kong airlines,3,they changed my seat,okinawa to hong kong very bad service i reserved aisle seat but they changed my seat without notifying me after just boarding the flight they have not turned on the ac and the cabin is really hot
8281,easyjet,2,staff extremely rude,horrible experience after 1 hour delay i was asked to pay 40 pounds for carrying a plastic bag with 2 items staff extremely rude the plane half empty so no overweight issues
5442,batik air,4,disorganized and chaotic,the checkin was extremely disorganized and chaotic all the destinations were lumped together resulting in people yelling changing queues etc several customers missed their flights which could have been avoided if the airline had organized the check in counters by say langkawi singapore bali etc but the airplane itself was clean and the crew was courteous
14290,lynx air,4,utter disorganization was on full display,our expectations of this airline were low expecting a low frills experience not only were our low expectations not met but their utter disorganization was on full display our story echoes others in that we arrived suitably early for our flights both to and from our destination only for us to find hours long delays in boarding their claims of weather delays lacked credibility and after i advised their counter staff of their obligation to provide updates every 30 minutes did they start sharing info i dont recommend buying tickets too far into the future
1851,air india,1,no inflight entertainment,no inflight entertainment when i asked the staff regarding this they clearly said that the airline knew about this and they have taken the aircraft from the hangar and deployed it the journey was 12 hours and with no in flight entertainment it was a nightmare the return journey from delhi to melbourne was the same if not worse no7 inflight entertainment again no reclining seats with my ticket purchase i paid to have the in flight entertainment as a part of what this airline advertised this is false advertising
3657,aircalin,5,aircalin customer review,sydnou economy a330 wonderful flight and service especially compared to qantas on the way back great food lovely wine and digestif
7214,cityjet,5,cityjet customer review,just returned from a weekend in amsterdam flying out of london city airport flight was fine for a short flight and the location of city airport was convenient was disappointed by how they handled the large volume of cabin trolley cases on both outward and return flights on the way out of london nothing was said until my friend and i boarded the plane and there was no space left in the overhead lockers for our trolley cases both of which were standard cabin size this was the case for a number of passengers and it was inconvenient as we were told that we had to take them to the front of the plane for them to be put in the hold which caused difficulties as passengers were trying to get down the aisle in opposing directions on the return flight out of schipol as we queued at the gate to get on the plane they saw that about 1012 of the passengers at the front of the queue including us and told us that we would have to hand our baggage in to be placed in the hold what bothered me was that after we took our seats we saw people coming onto the place after us who had trolley cases bigger than ours so it seemed unfair that some of the passengers were treated differently
15119,nok air,4,passenger service nosedived,i have frequently used nok air for flights within thailand and have found the airline consistently good even after its recent problems with pilots and working hours i took it for a recent weekend in the northeast city of udon thani for whatever reason as other posters have pointed out standards of passenger service have nosedived economy checkin for a midday flight was split between two aisles covering all the airlines flights with just 3 counters open on one and 2 on the other unfortunately i was in the other queue with about 40 passengers ahead of me that in itself would have presented little problem except two separate passengers had their passports locked in their suitcases then despite the rule of one onboard cabin bag with a max weight of 7kgs 8 others in the queue had at least two largish bags and of course when they got to the checkin desk a lot more time was wasted opening and re packing all the time the checkin ladies just sat and watched a couple of desks away was a nok employee just playing with his movie phone the question therefore is realising that these problems arise and given that nok had no less than 3 service representatives floating around that area doing precious little why on earth were they not checking for these particular problems long before the relevant passengers were anywhere near checkin as if that were bad enough once on the aircraft one man boarded with 3 sizeable pieces of luggage one a trolley bag with the considerable difficulty he had hoisting it into the overhead bin that alone clearly weighed well over 7kgs of course low cost carriers have their rules and certain inconvenience is virtually guaranteed but a failure to make simple checks and a failure to enforce rules just makes the experience less bearable
471,aerolineas argentinas,2,aerolineas argentinas customer review,flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from buenos aires i used alitalia lounge in terminal 3 modern large with limited food options salads sandwiches desserts i was one of the first to board the plane so i had to wait almost 30 mins to get any drinkwelcome drink without asking for it fas started to give drinks only after boarding was finished seat was ok not full flat but quite comfy ife very poor only 5 channels available showing only 2 movies in spanishenglish version no air show with a map available so had no idea about flight time etc cabin crew were nice and smiling quite senior and during breakfast service looking very tired and grumpy disappointing menu i was expecting some local dishes from argentina some beef etc and i got green salad with parma ham risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli i tried first two all tasted the same bland boring over cooked no cocktail service at all as only whisky is available good wines service in business class is very old fashioned reminds me service from the 90s nothing modern as for plating food presentation menu etc dirty toilet in business class breakfast started 2 hrs before landing again boring tray with fruit salad yoghurt bread roll and almost shapeless croissaint jam and hot omlet with carrots horrible generally very poor business class product no pa from pilots for whole flight not recommended
18556,smartwings,7,there actually was space for legs,flew smartwings from djerba to brno pretty good plane was new and clan surprisingly for low cost airline there actually was space for legs staff were quite friendly and even offered younger son to see cockpit and pilots have been very nice to him answering all and sometimes pretty stupid questions
17571,sata air azores,3,undue stress and frustration,we travelled on flight s4301 from lisbon to toronto on feb 10th firstly the entertainment system did not work on our flight to lisbon on jan 7th and still was not working on feb 10th flight most importantly we never check baggage when flying however sat azores limits cabin baggage to 8 kg so we reluctantly checked two small bags weighing approx 10 kg each arriving in toronto the whole flights luggage did not arrive on carousel 9 for 15 hrs other flights landed after us and had baggage on carousels before they got thru customs eg georgetownport of spain miami and reykjavik 15 hrs to get luggage is totally unacceptable no one can leave for a connecting flight without taking luggage thru customs this caused undue stress and frustration for the whole flight
12109,jet2com,8,look at different companies,tenerife to stansted we have no issues with the flight or crew on the flight both were brilliant however we did find one of the reps at the hotel hard rock tenerife on saturday 7th december who was handling the luggage transfers i found not in keeping with good customer service i thought we had booked the whole package via jet 2 but it appeared that i had booked through expedia so not able to use this service even though flying with jet2com her colleague was helpful and friendly and explained the situation but the rep was quite rude not verbally but when looking on the paperwork and seeing i had booked through expedia she quickly walked over to her colleague who was on the phone to the office and pointed at the fact it was booked through expedia and pulled a face we were planning on bringing our family back sometime next year but will now look at different companies
21470,us airways,4,us airways customer review,the checkin process was good flight on time comfortable seats my major concern was the flight attendants we encountered out of four flights on this trip we only had one attendant that we did not overhear complain about the airline we sat in exit rows on all the flights and in seats that allowed conversation with them we specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row the attendant told us we were wrong so we made the move per request then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along the attendant apologized but didnt ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat my husband had circulation problems so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room when the beverage cart came by we did ask for a complementary rum and coke to compensate us which we did receive i would have to think twice before flying with us airways again
23073,xl airways france,8,xl airways france customer review,xl airways france is a charter airline that has recently entered the us market i flew sfo to cdg nonstop and paid 500 less per person than i would have on air france thats considerable savings i read you get what you pay for well i happen to have flown air france also and they are no different than xl airways france the economy in xlf is very similar to air france with the exception of ife individual screens you get two meals on a 10 hour flight a warm meal after take off and a cold meal before landing one my first leg i upgraded to premium economy for a measly 39 the only difference is a few extra inches of leg room barely noticeable and leather seats you still dont get individual screens only in galaxie class or first class crew is extremely friendly and bilingual
15339,olympic air,5,queue for checkin delayed flight,rhodes to athens delayed by 42 mins very sad to see the delays in olympic air flights queue for checkin delayed flight barely any checking of my covid vaccination status for domestic flight no parking at jetway gates no air conditioning in airport buses in 40 degrees the cabin is still operated very well and the flight attendants are very helpful
15416,olympic air,5,olympic air customer review,my daughter 10yrs flew paris to zakynthos through athens on 18th july with the unaccompanied services she did tell me about the um service in athens when she got there she was taken to a room with other children to wait 3 hours for the next flight the staff in the room who was supposed to look after them smoked all the time this is absolutely shocking to see the way they treat children
13368,lan airlines,9,lan airlines customer review,we travelled from melbourne to rio de janeiro within brazil argentina and back to melbourne via santiago 6th october29th october with a total of 12 flights there was a problem in buenos aires which meant we missed our connecting flight home from santiago we were tired and unwell we were so grateful for the excellent assistance and kindness we received from airline staff in santiago
18803,southwest airlines,2,sw was very blatant and careless,i was at the clev boarding gates and the gentlemen said my purchased 2nd seat wasnt printed properly and kept my boarding pass but he would bring it to me once corrected got on a the plane nothing to hold my 2nd seat and couldnt get the attention of the flighty stewardess at the front to advise once the plane was completely full the guy from boarding gates came and loudly announced to the couple next to me that one of them had to move to another flight due to that seat already being purchased after they questioned him since they were there and seating is fcfs he loudly announced in front of entire plane its because of her size its a safety issue the entire plane laughed and talked about me the entire flight saying i should have been made to get off i cried the entire flight home of embarrassment since my weight is due to a medical condition sw promised me a luv voucher for my inconvenience which was routed to the wrong email not one on my complaint and then refused to deal with me any further i am advising please avoid sw if you are of size when i flew american in the past they were much more understanding and private in their interactions about my second seat purchase sw ruined my self esteem and created any future flying with a traumatic experience worrying the same will happen again sw was very blatant and careless about discriminating against someone of size
21852,virgin australia,8,staff were friendly and helpful,a very enjoyable flight check in was easy there was a slight departure delay staff were friendly and helpful the food served was quite good but it could have been a bit more substantial they also seem to offer the same dishes on their flights desert was a tiny chocolate however the wine served was excellent overall a good flight
21042,tuifly,4,seats uncomfortable,old aircraft seats very narrow and uncomfortable however so called premium class did not look much different the food was average strange tasting served in unsuitable packaging however the cabin staff was extremely positive friendly and helpful
4294,american eagle,4,not be using this airline again,nashville to chicago my initial flight was an hour and a half late no reason for the delay was given i ran through the airport to catch my connecting flight and they refused to let me board with 10 minutes to spare the plane was still stationary and attached to the gate 25 minutes later i asked them the soonest they could get me a flight to my destination and they replied curtly 4 pm tomorrow thats all we can do they had me in tears will not be using this airline again
19605,taag angola airlines,8,pleasantly surprised with taag,i was pleasantly surprised with taag flying return from cape town to lisbon via luanda the aircraft was clean the meals very good though the presentation and accompaniments were on the cheap side seats were comfortable and the 3x3x3 seating feeling much more spacious than the 3x4x3 found many airlines 777s ground staff in cape town were pleasant and the crew pleasant throughout luanda airport could be vastly improved by offering clean toilets otherwise it is ok luanda airport also has a boneyard of abandoned aircraft some interesting specimens while only using the flight tracking on the in flight entertainment it seemed to have a selection of films and shows considering the price speed and great route from south africa to portugal there is no competition and i am already booked for my next flight with them
5170,ba cityflyer,5,a disappointing experience,zurich to london city airport no real business class experience the gate for this short haul flight was very unusually at terminal e some additional 15 minutes away from the main terminal luckily i had only little hand baggage and had checked in online before otherwise i would have missed the flight boarding was rather chaotic no special lane for business class the seats were okay but narrow and cramped as it was an early morning flight we got hot breakfast with was disappointing in quantity and quality the fruit salad looked tired no muesli nor yoghurt a disappointing experience but rather typical for flights to city airport
6576,cathay pacific airways,7,ive asked for a partial refund,i actually made four longhaul flights on cathay this trip overall the standard was solid fourstar rather than five the food and drink were acceptable if unexciting and the seats were comfortable but the absence of any sort of privacy screens was surprising and felt dated all the flight attendants were extraordinarily prompt at responding to requests for service and appeared willing i had two main issues on the flight from auckland to hong kong 1112 hours 38 seats in business i think there was no champagne available after takeoff a flight attendant told me they had only loaded three bottles which ran out on the ground the flight was late into hong kong so i was transferred to a later flight on which i was assigned without warning or apology a middle seat instead of the window id reserved the absence of any privacy screen meant i spent a rather intimate 13 hours with a stranger he was a nice chap but if i want a blind date ill go online rather than on an aircraft i paid 5000 for business because i wanted champane and privacy so i am not too happy anyways ive asked for a partial refund and was going to await a response from cathay before posting but cathay has just responded a member of our customer care team will review your case and respond in approximately six weeks time oh well
9314,fiji airways,4,cancelled because of cyclone,nadi to singapore flight got cancelled because of cyclone which is understandable however no news from the airlines for the next 36h on a new flight no compensation or accommodation because it was outside of their control called in more than 5 times was put on hold only to be hung up after waiting patiently for 15h no customer service plane food was average at best only one meat option and they only offered chicken seats have decent leg room but are cushions are thin inair entertainment is ok but screens on the plane are tiny and quality is terrible
5708,blue islands,5,we left about seven hours late,i hate to say this but my opinion of blue islands has really changed after my flight to southampton it started by the airport announcing that my 7am flight was delayed to 940am due to a late inbound aircraft once 940 came around we were informed that the flight was delayed until 1050am due to bad weather there was light mist but lots of other aircraft were arriving in fine soon after that we were informed that blue islands had no idea when our plane was going to arrive and told to wait until 1030 for new information the new information was infact just that the new information would be coming at 1130am and then next info at 1230 and then next info at 1300 absolutely no blue islands or flybe staff around in the terminal then our plane lands but the delay still keeps on being pushed back in total we left about seven hours late on the way back we were delayed about half an hour which isnt too bad the aircraft we were on were clearly very old and tired there were some loose pieces of metal on the cabin walls and the seats had small damage and overall the cabin was fairly discoloured and dirty cabin crew were very friendly however i usually am fine with blue islands and have no problems with the flybe franchise however the service was awful i would try and avoid blue islands in the future
12277,jetblue airways,2,delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours,jetblue has to be the worst airline flying out of south florida right now especially since the fort lauderdale closure on april 12th jetblue has canceled the late night fort lauderdale to las vegas flight flight 607 three times one flight was canceled on a monday which 3 days after they actually opened up the airport that also means that the people in las vegas waiting for flight 607 cannot get back to fort lauderdale because the flight never gets to las vegas the ripple effects are disastrous jetblue also has four local flights such as fort lauderdale to jacksonville and jacksonville back to the fort lauderdale and fort lauderdale to cuba and cuba back to fort lauderdale flight number 17 18 1499 and 1500 and for the past 4 days each of them have been delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours with two of them being canceled all together and weather really has nothing to do with it since april 15th the weather has been fine down here we have had very little rain but even the four local flights which are only about an hour and 20 minutes apart also been delayed 3 to 6 hours or have been canceled about a year ago jetblue stated to the public that they will have fewer frequency of flights which will allow them more flexibility when things go wrong but obviously that is not the case
13110,kulula,2,kulula customer review,we flew to ot on kulula last week from cape town the initial flight i booked was cancelled by cell phone and we were placed on the next flight with no apology and great inconvenience to ourselves on our return flight we were bumped at the last moment having arrived 2 hours earlythen told they could actually fit us in the flight by then was running at least 34 an hour late the couple ahead of us had been bumped twice that day
13550,latam airlines,2,no respect for their customers,latam is fine as long as there are no issues our flight got cancelled due to maintenance issues and thats when the trouble started latam personnel is constantly contradicting itself and providing wrong information they are badly organised in case of a calamity such as a cancellation which causes long and unnecessary waiting times for their costumers under stressful conditions the company does not give the compensation that it is legally required to provide the personnel does not seem to care about their customers simply no respect for their customers
14400,malawian airlines,1,never recommend this airline,johannesburg to blantyre they overbooked the flight still checked us in then made us wait almost 8 hours standing around the ticketing office with absolutely incompetent staff no one knew what was going on nor could assist us on top of that they have also lost our bags i could never recommend this airline to anyone to travel ever use another airline
470,aerolineas argentinas,5,aerolineas argentinas customer review,my flight to buenos aires was not full plenty of room to stretch flight to miami was full because of school vacation big mistake on my part the a330 is uncomfortable in economy when the seat in front of you is reclined you have the tray table pitted against you stomach even if you are not fat the flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the a330 rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally one must slide to the end and climb out i have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in economy horrible considering how packed the flight was the flight attendants were excellent the food was mediocre with two choices pasta or beef and very small servings flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight bathrooms were kept fairly clean movie selection was very good free headphones were provided a very uncomfortable aircraft avoid the a330 economy only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats checkin at eze was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos
21063,tuifly,4,tuifly customer review,berlin txl to cairo and back for the low price service was good seat pitch acceptable the meals came in a cheap paper box but were quite tasty plenty of rounds with free non alcoholic drinks newspapers pillows and blankets and comfy leather seats toilets were a little bit old and smelly but not dirty the flight attendants were efficient but not so very patient with some of the non german passengers i had the impression that they were not used to communicate with a multi national mix of passengers and got easily annoyed to explain things twice however these were excellent flights at a very reasonable price
16827,rossiya airlines,5,nothing outside of the ordinary,i took a trip on aeroflot from moscow to st petersburg operated by rossiya airlines i booked the flight late so i paid a considerable premium on the ticket that said it was cheaper than the roundtrip ticket on the sapsan highspeed train from moscow to peter as expected for a holiday weekend the flight was at or near capacity the a319 had more leg room than my last flight on the a319 i flew with s7 airlines but not much more boarding is not by zones or by class it seems in russia it is whoever gets in line first and a bit chaotic the line typically forms quickly before boarding and it is better to be early in line basic economy traveling is cheap within russia but like airlines worldwide the charges add up with luggage etc so everyone tries to just bring carryon bags therefore if you have carryon luggage you need to get in the line early or you might not find any overhead storage space the flight is relatively short about 15 hours so you can tolerate a little discomfort the flight attendents were professional but not friendly once airborne they hastily served a small rather tasteless snack and choice of water tea or coffee no juice or alcoholic beverages the temperature in the cabin was very warm an experience that i have had on every flight i have taken inside of russia russians tend to like it warm but this was a bit too warm on the return flight to moscow we sat in a holding pattern above vnukovo airport for about 45 minutes and ended up reaching the gate 35 minutes late no reason given by the pilot when he informed us of the delay but delays sometimes happen because vnukovo2 is used for flights of highranking government officials overall since i booked the tickets late it was an expensive flight so value for the money might be skewed to the negative however that was my fault that said the flight was nothing outside of the ordinary
22478,volotea,1,worst company i have flown with,worst company i have flown with just avoid it at any cost its a lot better to pay more for another company once they cancelled a flight a week before our journey to santorini greece september 2021 and they didnt refund anything just like that and the mails said that we will give you refund etc and nothing ever happened but we said okay it was just bad luck or a coincidence and also there were no other flights the days we wanted so it was a dead end now we have booked priority in order to have our carry on with us we saw the tickets and they told us we cannot have our carry on with us we show them that it says here we are allowed to have 10kg bag per person and everything that is written in the ticket and they just answered us that these are general information but they say for my journey the times the airplane door etc everything we show them the confirmation mail that says we have priority etc and they told us in our system it doesnt say so and we just paid again for what we had already paid
5515,batik air,5,not too bad a service,flew batik air from sorong to jakarta on november 23rd the flight took off on time and landed in jakarta on schedule the business class seats are comfortable however there is very limited services onboard however the cabin crew were helpful baggage arrived within 15 minutes of landing overall not too bad a service
354,aeroflot russian airlines,6,on time with good food and comfort,new york to nursultan return via moscow review covers svojfk su10024sep as this was the best of the four flights ground staff in all cities are surprisingly professional flights board well in advance of departure and airplanes when loaded depart schedules are not padded for time and flight time is accurate premium economy is excellent value with comfortable seats decent amenities and big filling meals the only alcohol served is beer and wine drinks service is followed immediately with meal oddly the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep announcements are continuous and interrupting first prerecorded russianenglish followed by crew russianenglish announcements repeating the same message crews are typical ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant willing smiling junior cabin staff services svotsesvo on airbus equipment with no ife are similar with nice food disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort svo is sprawling transiting without visa is easy but you cannot linger between flights due to crowds and distance aeroflot was ok on time with good food and comfort the nonstop announcements and timing of meal services however are offputting and would cause me to look at other airline options
7301,comair,7,overall a decent flight,johannesburg to cape town the slow lounge at jnb sets the standard with an impressive array of food even at 11 am and ample seating the bar service is good too and some neighbours had already finished their third refill of pink champagne by the time they boarded the same flight as is common on other ba flights group 1 passengers were kept waiting on the airbridge before boarding actually commenced service on board was friendly and efficient but very much old school ba as far as the fourcourse lunch was concerned at least one was able to see the main course before choosing it departure and arrival were pretty much on schedule and baggage collection was speedy too overall a decent flight
4878,avelo airlines,1,horrible customer service,this airline has horrible customer service they made me pay for a carry on with a backpack that was not even questioned on the way down to fort myers do not fly this airline they do not care about their customers and charge unnecessary fees not worth saving money on a ticketbecause you dont terrible experience
14877,montenegro airlines,6,montenegro airlines customer review,first leg cdgtgd in new e195 cabin had no interest in their pax whatsoever they gave food 20 minutes before the drinks round they had several choices of sandwich but didnt inform about it return tgdcdg with more experienced cabin crew in old f100 which has more legroom friendlier cabin crew gave food and drinks at the same time landing was quite an experience as everything started to shake in the plane good airline if you get the right cabin crew

6590,cathay pacific airways,8,they have once again improved,after almost 8 years of not flying with them because i felt their standards had dropped i gave them another chance and i am glad i did they have once again improved from kuala lumpur cx uses malaysia airlines golden lounge in satellite terminal which is spacious but lacking in staff and food offerings the a330 j cabin is the regional 2x2x2 angle lie flat designs from quite a few years ago for short to medium haul this is quite acceptable in march 2023 post pandemic time mask is no longer mandatory cathay once again introduces hot towels and meals served in separate courses only things absent were inflight magazines duty free catalogues and on board duty free sales other than that its business as usual meals were nicely presented in simple but chic white porcelain wares with 3 mains to choose from our cabin was full for the day and 4 crew worked diligently to make sure everyone is happy the flight itself was uneventful and very relaxing i have now regained confidence with cx and will be happy to fly with them wherever i go after all my home is in hk and its to my advantage if i fly them as for me to have more direct flight choices and easier to collect miles
2390,air moldova,5,air moldova customer review,vie to kiv the experience was quite odd like going back into the soviet days as they were using a yak40 on the flight staff friendly and relatively professional although it felt almost like a charter flight the meal was quite good and flight was on time the cabin layout was really bizarre with something looking like a couch near the front of the plane and little leg room in my seat the fact that they didnt deice the plane it was snowing hard at takeoff freaked me out a bit too not sure if theyre still using the yak40 but if you happen to get on this one its certainly a unique experience if youre up for it
22503,volotea,9,friendliness of the company,highlight the friendliness of the company the good price ratio mainly on domestic flights and the customer service that for me is very important to talk to people and not machines it does not charge hand luggage it allows you to check it in for free and if you are a priority you can take it in the cabin i recommend it to my friends
7934,cubana airlines,1,cubana airlines customer review,we arrived at airport to find flight cancelled havana to london due to leave 8pm when asked no reason was given we were told to wait in a queue and no info was forthcoming til passengers got stroppy they put us up in a hotel for the night hotel was quite nice only good point next day the flight left on time 11pm but went via paris flight was delayed by 75 mins in paris and still no explanation given no communication from flight staff passengers getting very angry eventually we arrive in london after a 27 hour delayed departure and about 13 hours on the plane

2462,air namibia,1,air namibia customer review,checking in at 0600 in cape town along with my husband and 20 month old baby for our flight back to whk at 0800 we were casually informed that our plane was inserviceble and would hopefully be ready for departure at 1000 needless to say that did not happen and we departed at 1800 that evening without much of an explanation or apology my husband dared his next venture with air namibia on 21 march and was casually informed 5hours before his flight that it was cancelled but had been rebooked on a sal flight to be booked in within 2 hours which turned out not to be true after confirming the booking with sal ourselves we live 500km away from whk and cannot be on standby to be ready for their flight changes as it suits them we have always been regular travelers with air namibia but unfortunately it seems not to be safe anymore to rely on their unserviceable planes or their inconsiderate service

18740,southwest airlines,2,why would i ever fly with them again,the day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from houston to san diego we noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict we arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time so i stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the overworked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didnt see anything that was better this phrase came up a lot but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they dont have control of the weather etc regarding delays the only flights from southwest that were delayed were those to san diego it was not weather related as the flights to and from san diego were also on schedule except ours after waiting until we could check luggage 45hrs we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended 5 minute layover agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to boise but she could only see houston connections so i called their 800 number 3rd agent was an explanation followed by holdhangup 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option but because we checked baggage 4 the only person willing to help us had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from san diego to boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us i asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection but that would be unfair to everyone else so we sat in the back i knew i was being lied to but at this point i figured id just wait to see what would happen we fly to san diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a 100 voucher for a later flight yay i looked at my pass and it was an a position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food terminal was super crowded due to construction so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit i mentioned how it was nice that we didnt get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was c30 and his girlfriend was c15 i took our passes to the 7th agent 6 was for new passes and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together she immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers i stated that my original tickets were in the a group for that leg of the flight in an irritated voice but she stuck to her argument at this point i was done with their service so i expressed to her that i had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored she threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor the supervisor 8 and i had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness but she would allow us to board together she mentioned the 100 vouchers but why would i ever fly with them again id pay not to and told her so she also asked why i didnt ask for a supervisor isnt that their job when they cant help a customer flying with southwest is just not worth the trouble they get a 2 rating because their flight staff is actually amazing
3226,airasia india,1,completely unacceptable behaviour,i was supposed to be travelling from bangalore to kochi on the airasia flight on march 23 we reached the airport on time but because they didnt mention that the flight is in the newly launched terminal we were late to reach the boarding gate but even though there was still time to board the flight the crew didnt allow to board the flight we knew this because when we where waiting to leave from the second terminal 15 minutes after not allowed entry another airasia crew asked tried to help us to board the same flight 15 minutes after being denied entry this is completely unacceptable behaviour unexpected from airasia india and we will make sure not to choose this flight again in future
17692,scat airlines,8,i am glad i flew with them,scat has a very poor reputation but i had no problems with them check in was performed by a handling agent in almaty and as usual with any airline there it was perfunctory but efficient i had selected my seats previously online with no issues the flight started to board a little late alongside an air astana flight departing 5 minutes later to astana resulting in many passengers going to the wrong gate and being turned back there this is more an airport issue than an airline one though the flight pushed back around 5 minutes behind schedule the aircraft although rather old felt comfortable and the crew were very efficient they managed to serve candies before take off a boxed meal and a drink followed by tea and coffee and more candies before landing all for a 1 hour 20 minute flight baggage was included in the ticket price and the onboard service was friendly the price was less than many european low cost carriers would charge for their most basic service their low safety ranking nearly put me off but according to their website they are working on getting accreditation so this reassured me and i am glad i flew with them
19667,tam airlines,4,crew were sitting in our seats,travelled domestically on tam from grumao in relax business class on the a330 we were in seats 1d1g the seats were situated in the first class compartment of plane which has just 4 seats these were full flat beds and very comfortable the cabin was quite dated and shabby carpet all frayed and very dirty and the seats were quite tatty upon boarding the cabin crew were sitting in our seats and seemed quite miffed that wed been assigned the seats and that had to move cabin service was awful onboard within 10 mins of seatbelt sign being released the crew came through offering a small cheese bun and a soft drink they were not seen again for the remainder of the 4hour flight entertainment was okay but not as good as the 767 we travelled out on flight was on time and actually arrived about 15 mins early

5222,bahamasair,3,worst communication ive seen from any airline,our flight from nassau to great exuma was delayed 1 hour then they changed the gate without letting anyone know almost half the plane was running to the gate for final boarding on the return from ggt to nassau we were delayed 2 hours with no explanation and no communication ive flown all around the world and this is the worst communication ive seen from any airline not run very well in my opinion management needs to look at improving themselves i would look at western air next time we come to bahamas
7357,condor airlines,2,expect an apology and a voucher,my wifes flight was delayed due to crew not showing up on time in addition to many other reasons she landed late in seattle and missed connecting flight was told by connecting airline to either get another connecting flight or get a voucher for hotel through condor help desk the girl sitting there at the condor booth was playing on her phone when my wife asked to help with getting hotel voucher or moving the flight earlier and her response was sorry i cannot help you my supervisor will be here to help you in 30 mins 30 mins came and other girls were there also there playing on their phones my wife came up to ask 2 or 3 other female employees who came to the condor help booth to work on the voucher so that she can get to the hotel with the infant as they have not slept for over 20 hours all their response was we cannot do anything and our supervisor is busy after over 1 hour my wife confronted these employees and and pressed on them to call their supervisor after over 1 hour supervisor came down and did apologize i expect an apology and a voucher
13034,korean air,3,nickel and dime culture,los angeles to chiang mai via seoul we decided to spend a little bit more for our flight to thailand in exchange for a better service and were disappointed we could have saved several hundreds of dollars if we had used a chinese budget airline what was good about korean air were the flight attendants who were super friendly and helpful on our return flight to lax they even carried my carry on bag for me when they saw that i was holding our baby the reason why we wont fly with korean air anymore i had ordered a vegetarian oriental meal not vegan but vegetarian which isnt as restrictive what i received was a joke it looked like someone had emptied half a can of peas into the aluminum container and thrown some bok choi leaves on top no sauce tofu rice or potatoes horrible my wife was still hungry after her meal and asked for a snack the answer was we dont carry any snacks contrary to what their website says snack service a wide variety of snacks such as samgak kimbop cup ramen pizza and makkoli rice cakes are served on long flights the flight attendant explained we stopped offering cup ramen because of the smell when my wife told him that she used to get ramen on previous flights i had one can of beer at the beginning of the flight and ordered a gin tonic several hours later this drink spilled because my table was defective the kind which you pull out from the armrest when i asked for another drink they watered it down and advised me this is your last drink each passenger is allowed to have only 3 drinks i was not the slightest little bit drunken and very surprised because even on low budget airlines like air india nobody told me how many drinks i could have this is obviously a policy which is supposed to save the airline money we both started to get a headache because of dehydration when i asked for water the flight attendant poured approximately 4 table spoons into a cup i went back and forth several times between our seats and the pantry and each time they filled the cup only 50 we were both thirsty during the entire flight before departure there was a bottle of water on each seat and as soon as the boarding was completed they hurried to collect the water bottles from the vacant seats probably in order to lock them up in the safe 5 we had purchased an inflatable pillow which was specifically designed for air travel as soon as my wife started to inflate the pillow several flight attendants approached us saying that we were not allowed to use it obviously korean airs management made decisions in order to save money and we felt this nickel and dime culture during the entire trip if we had chosen a low cost chinese airline we may have received some kind of rude treatment but enough to eat and drink for several hundred dollars less

1115,air busan,8,great value budget airline,osaka to busan great value budget airline web site and onboard magazine promise free water but none was offered checkin at kix was about 20 minutes checkin at pus was zero with no other customers in sight offered decent seats even though we hadnt prebooked them outward flight was delayed due to air traffic control restrictions at kix but landed on time due to timetable padding return flight left early but landed slightly late after circling around western japan for ages boarding on both flights smooth bus to terminal at pus but sky bridge on return flight perfectly adequate and reasonably efficient for a budget airline and a onehour flight would use again
21282,turkmenistan airlines,7,turkmenistan airlines customer review,birmingham to amritsar via ashgabat checkin smooth and flight left on time plane clean and staff could speak enough english to make themselves understood the drinks trolley came around every hour or so but no alcoholic drinks there was no entertainment onboard apart from a map showing where we were landed on time at ashgabat airport the transfer lounge was adequate we waited approx 90 minutes before we continued onto amritsar we sat in the same seats so no new boarding passes were required we arrived on time at amritsar the things i didnt like about this airline were that it was no longer cheap in the uk they have put their prices up by 50 from last year also they dont have life jackets something that petrifies me as i panic when flying one other moan i have is that whenever we hit turbulence and we did quite often there was no announcement telling passengers to return to their seats and put their seat belts on children were playing in the aisles as we went up and down
20823,transasia airways,9,transasia airways customer review,travel again with tna to tpe from sin on 1117 sep outgoing flight was not full but service is good the a330300 was brand new so no complaints about dirty seats carpets toilets food uplifted from sin could have been better selected wv from the menu during booking but the food on the return leg was much better the best inflight food i have tasted so far one disappointment is that the cabin attendants did not serve packets of peanuts on the return leg but provided the much needed juice that i asked for the peanuts would have gone down well with the drink
664,aigle azur,1,worst experience ever,beirut to paris worst experience ever i booked online a two way ticket for a very tight scheduled business flight and after taking the money from my bank account a few days later i received a notification that the return flight was rescheduled to two days later which does not suite me although tickets offerings for the same date were still available on many sites online a couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled i was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund upon choosing the full refund i got back less than 40 of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable the funniest thing is that the cancelled flight was charged much less than the outbound flight and this was the only amount subject to full refund i never recommend aigle azur i rate this act as a sort of phishing they lie to you about cheap available flights and then reschedule it based on their interest so you will be the only and major loser for cancelling if the rescheduling does not suite you
7598,corendon airlines,3,corendon airlines customer review,adamantalya and return one negative comment the very narrow seats specially with a 15 year old child on your lap no knee space at all and im just 180 cm my husband had to put his legs behind his neck in order to sit we fly regularly but never in such narrow seats the 4 hour flight time becomes very long because of this extra leg space at the emergency exits costs 15 pp extra but not available when you travel with children checkin was quick both times service is excellent very friendly staff no snacksdrinks included the plane wasnt the youngest but except the dirty toilets it was acceptable if youre not that tall and dont intent to use the toilets or on board services i can recommend this airline

22276,vlm airlines,7,vlm airlines customer review,lcyantwerp unable to check in on line for no apparent reason on arrival check in machines also refused to accept flights to antwerp so joined long queue to the 3 check in desks that operated for all the cityjet flights eventually checked in only to find that the security queue snaked through the airport building almost to the doors not sure what went wrong but staff were eventually cherry picking those passengers whose flights were imminent to go to front of queue by contrast the flight both out and back on 30th oct were smooth and uneventful

23055,xl airways france,7,xl airways france customer review,this is a no frills operation but they do it right the on board staff was friendly and courteous and the plane was clean we traveled from jfk to paris and returned after 10 days it was difficult to hear and see the movies they played but for those who read this is not a problem the seats seemed small and not well padded the planes took off and arrived on time a big plus and we did not have to wait long for our luggage the woman who checked us in in paris was exceptionally nice no complaints and i would use this airline again
17207,rwandair,7,aircraft very well maintained,aircraft very well maintained terrible to make transit transfers in dxb had to struggle in the middle of the night with busses from t1 to t2 where there is always check in chaos and no signage nor separation of airlines had to insist on lounge access as the checkin counters could not care less about passengers was granted access to a sub par lounge in t2 called marhaba the bar sections was for smokers also so air was hazy poor boarding services at gate on time but then shuttled around by bus for ages after waiting in the bus for 20 minutes before it took off onboard nice atmosphere great decoration of business cabin great fas and good good caring however no menu cards nor drink list sparse supply food acceptable and plenty ife worked well seats very nice and spacious i slept well got dinner at night and got a full breakfast from mombasa to kigali good airline though not attached to any alliance ticket not cheap otherwise could have rated 810

10979,hi fly,7,operated my norwegian flight,hifly operated my norwegian flight from paris cdg to los angeles the premium class seats were very comfortable however inflight entertainment was limited and not on par with that of major carriers meals were very average although the flight attendants were all polite and professional id be open to flying them again only if the ticket price was substantially below that of the legacy carriers
19384,sunwing airlines,4,worst flight i have ever taken,flying back from miami to toronto boarding time was 1120 waiting and nothing was told to us boarded at 1220 apparently there was a snow storm in toronto and a 3hr flight turned into a 6hr flight going to hamiliton and sitting on the plane for over 2hrs mind you our flight was to land at 3pm no food was offered to us only one small cookie and water hungry and frustrated for hours sitting on the plane stating it was gonna leave to toronto every 15 minutes and never did once landed in toronto around 9pm had to take a shuttle to customs and baggage claim once customs was done getting our baggage was a hassle 3 times they told us different areas to pick up luggage waiting and waiting my luggage was no where to be seen finding my luggage in a totally different area then told worst flight i have ever taken and worst experience getting my luggage
19995,thai airasia,7,this airline is a good choice,khon kaen to bangkok don muang thai airasia provides good quality for the money though there are minor points of criticism i bought their premium flex package which gave me the option to choose my seat 1c a meal even though the flight took only 55 minutes plus water 20 kg luggage and express luggage and boarding the flight attendants were polite but a bit too reserved to my taste the seat was a bit too narrow and the meal lasagna too bland boarding was fast with a separate check in for those with a premium package thus hardly any waiting time my luggage came almost as first so they were true to their promise for short flights as mine i think this airline is a good choice
8899,ethiopian airlines,4,average to below average,average to below average dirty dated 767 on route no entertainment low calibre staff check in chaotic with no queue management online check in never works no counters for onlineno check baggage food globular but edible
9160,eva air,3,so bad and customer unfriendly,my wife and i we are really outraged by the way we have been treated by the eva air br75 team the flight times have been moved up to 5 times due to technical issues finally it was the next day in the meantime we received 2 food vouchers which could be used at a limited number of shops the route from the gate to the shops was a long walk and then back we are an elderly couple and not very mobile by the time we got to a snack shop there was already a queue of 50 people reason many of those kind of shops were closed due to renovations so we had to walk even further at the end of the day we had to go to another gate we had to wait again without further information finally we followed the whole group of people to the immigration gate we had to hand over our passports it is therefore forbidden according to the dutch government to hand over your passport only if there is legal approval for this a copy of our passports was not accepted if we refuse they wouldnt help us any further so we had to do this after a 30 minute bus ride we arrived at a hotel waiting endlessly again we got a very basic room no hot water no luggage we got a meal went to bed exhausted at 11 pm got up at 3 am because we had to take the bus to the airport at 4 am waiting again no one from eva air was there to explain anything 500 passengers in small groups were searching for information or help the flight was not listed and only around 0730 the staff arrived and boarding could begin we had to wait a long time for our passports because a pile of numbered passports had been dropped we are regular customers of eva air but we dont recognize the service anymore this was so bad and customer unfriendly this brings down the reputation of the company way down we have submitted a complaint but unfortunately have not received any response
17202,rwandair,7,amazing cabin crew,amazing cabin crew let me just say very attentive funny and helpful very rarely do i see the cabin crew literally helping every single person to put their baggage in the overhead compartments very friendly wake up calls for food or landing very efficient with handing out meals and drinks and didnt run out of anything that i know of on the flights seats were spacious and comfy easily comparable to other bigname airlines the rwanda airport isnt impressive but does offer free wifi and it seems like all connecting flights are only there for a very short layover mine were 1 hour 19 minutes and the other 2 hours prompt boarding times and every flight we landed roughly 1030 minutes earlier then we were supposed to i dont love the flight route due to there being so many stops along the way but definitely budget friendly so cant complain over all
7313,comair,7,pleasant experience,ba6416 from cape town to johannesburg pleasant crew served tasty chicken mayo sandwich and complimentary drinks return flight was okayish crew served delicious scrambled egg bacon chakalaka spicy sauce breakfast with yoghurt juice and teacoffee alternative choice was spinach and mozzarella pancake pleasant experience on shorthaul domestic
23091,yemenia,6,yemenia customer review,beirut to sanaa on a330 yemenia offers a first and economy class no business odd concept as the first class hardly lives up to expectations pretake off juice offered this is a dry airline and a passable dinner with a choice of three dishes presented on a trolley limited ife mostly in arabic but not a problem for this 3 hrs flight took off and landed more or less on time and the ticket price was good usual scramble at sanaa airport
17500,sata air azores,4,do not get any upgrades with them,i had to change my original flight due to a cancellation from wpb to boston on a separate airline at that point i called the main number to rebook for another date they were accommodating and helpful when we checked in our luggage they wanted to charge us for the extra that we had already paid for in advance because the attendant did no see a record of the prepaid baggage of course at that point we just paid for it again which cost us an additional 160also originally we had paid for seat upgrade 60 each 2 did not want to argue or dispute at that moment but visited the sata agency in ponta delgada to tell them what happened needless to say this was a long visit back and forth with supervisors needed to verify my ticket stubs and they wanted the actual baggage tickets to verify all of this needless to say this went on for over 1 month and they would not refund the upgrade in seats that we originally paid for and that someone else paid so sata made out with the price of these seats and if this happened to us most likely it has happened to many more people they did however refund for the extra luggage that we had already paid for moral of the story do not get any upgrades with them and make sure you get printed receipts for everything you purchasethey are not a responsible airlines and take no responsibility for their actions i fly with them as there are no other options in the azores but as soon as there are other airlines flying between islands or boston to azores they will loose a customer
2538,air new zealand,1,very stressful situation,air new zealand delayed their flight by 10 hours because staff resting requirements they sent us an update 12 hours before the flight we were in singapore so checked out and went to an airport to talk to someone as we would miss all connecting flights and picking up our fur baby on time where she couldnt stay another night there was no onefrom air nz at singapore airport the info center said use their help line the wait time was 4 hours by the time we rang them we had 15 hours left before the flight we could have re booked by the time they picked up it was 4 hours later very stressful situation we were stuck in an international airport with no one to talk to except stay on gold 4 hours hoping someone would pick up you should be ashamed
1452,air china,6,not worth the delays,san francisco to mumbai via beijing with air china business class was good for the price you pay but not worth the delays the food was good lots of sea food and steak very limited options for vegetarians though my connecting flight to mumbai was delayed by over 5 hours at beijing we spent hours circling around in the airport runways taxing then circling around again so a 6 hour flight to mumbai turned to 11 hours really frustrating the airline staff didnt give any proper updates for the delays the delays seem to be common at airports in china no wifi in plane changed my return flight to american airlines via hong kong
6206,brussels airlines,9,staff was kind attentive,copenhagen to entebbe via brussels our trip with them was amazing at the checkin counter the staff was so incredibly kind to put priority labels on all our of bags even though only one in our group of four was entitled to it a member in our group was in the need of wheel chair service and the staff was kind attentive and service minded our group was transported from gate to gate with a smile on the flight a member of our group could not eat the food they served because it contained tomatoes and shes allergic we did not inform brussels airlines about this prior to our trip so they had no way of being prepared for this however alternative food was presented by friendly and service minded staff all in all we are super happy that we chose brussels airlines and will definitely do it again
15089,nok air,6,cancelled the purchased flight,nok air cancelled the purchased flight with 48 hours notice and advised by email replies to request the same day later flight were ignored 24 hours later i had to ask someone in thailand to call nok air to rebook for me turned up for the later flight as planned with luggage of 42kg as recorded by international carrier nok scales weighed it at 459kg i complained so they weighed it on another desk where it was back to 42kg clearly there is a huge disparity on revenue generating scales delay was 7 hours so once journey was complete i attempted to claim 1000 baht insurance as covered according to the policy having opted to spend considerably more on a hotel as the delay was added to a 6 hour wait already necessary due to my inbound international flight three weeks later and after numerous emails of nonsense from nok air i gave up they can keep the 1000 baht im flying airasia instead more expensive and not known for customer service but better the nok air by a country mile on board nok are equally as good or bad as airasia depending on your expectations but customer service is not a concept nok air has mastered to date
18817,southwest airlines,1,delayed for over an hour on multiple flights,this airline delayed for over an hour on multiple flights this last one was apparently due to paperwork that needed to be done before we took off im not sure what kind of nonsense that is but its sounds like a complete waste of everyones time instead of getting the entire plane where we needed to go we sat at the gate for hours due to this paperwork i used to love flying southwest and now i will choose a different airline that actually cares about their passengers
11311,icelandair,6,our experience will make us think twice,flew from toronto yyz to iceland connecting to finland on june 12 2023 second time flew via icelandfinland did not have the same experience experience was good before however this time we were asked to give our carryon luggage to be checked in and we were told our carryon did not meet the required measurement dont understand this carry on had been used several times during trips the latest on our caribbean cruise in april 2023 with no problem although the staff were very nice and professional and just doing her job we had to open my luggage and removed our prescription meds we were taking with us when boarded in the plane noticed 2 passengers had larger carry on bags than mine my husband and i are rule followers and we felt this airline practiced discrimination and inconsistency in enforcing rules for passengers in fact one of the passengers in the plane made a comment to a passenger why his carryon was accepted since his luggage was huge and should have been denied the passenger involved could not comment because it was not his fault his luggage was approved despite this experience we had the crew members were nice professional and accommodating but our experience will make us think twice before booking our next flight with icelandair in the future unfortunately we have to return to toronto june 23 and hope our carryon that was denied will be approved this time and we will then make future decision whether to fly with icelandair for our next trip to finland in the future
11855,japan airlines,6,on board wifi is awful,tokyo to melbourne on the good side excellent seat lies properly flat and gives great privacy for business class big screen tv and the supplied mattress topper is a nice touch so comfortable the on board wifi is awful very slow and drops out on the way up i couldnt get it to connect at all but i was charged twice on the way home there have been service issues i ordered a meal 45 mins later i didnt have it i had to go forward and ask again they apologised then it came twice when finished i waited for the tray to be collected as that didnt happen i pressed the call bell no one came its a pity about the service good seat nice clean plane just service thats not good enough for business class prices
6844,china airlines,9,we recommend this airline,vancouver to bangkok via taipei we took 4 flights in all the service was friendly meals were enjoyable and there was plenty of video entertainment baggage was included in the ticket price the accommodation was comfortable and we recommend this airline
5289,bamboo airways,3,they moved the flight to an a320,booked travel on the 787 and in the end they moved the flight to an a320 a very old one service of the cabin crew was ok food wise wouldnt pay that much for business if i knew they were going to serve me that if i was not mistaken it was 2 choices chicken rice or the beef udon total rubbish seat was cramped on business too
7775,csa czech airlines,1,first flight late,milan malpensa to birmingham via prague first flight late from milan to prague second flight late from prague to birmingham lost my luggage something more yes after 5 days i still dont have my luggage
4776,austrian airlines,9,the meal was very good,boarding in venice started with a short delay flight to vienna was a short however pleasant experience a decent snack was served accompanied by austrian wines fas were very friendly only minor point was the fact that once again the plane was not at a gate in vienna despite the bus transfers were ok flight to brussels was very good despite the delay on this flight a hot meal was served with a cake as dessert the meal was very good good austrian wines as well the purser and her assistant on this flight were exceptional a more than decent business experience in europe for sure my best european flight so far during this year
9253,ravn alaska,6,ravn alaska customer review,ancfaianc economy open seating check in was difficult the checkin agent did not understand how to read my ticket and almost seemed to blame me for the error once on board however the flight attendants both on the outbound and return were very nice especially on the return flight a definite sense of humor era offers low fares between anchorage and fairbanks and i will be flying with them again its also nice not to have to go to security when flying on the smaller planes
20570,tigerair,7,the good and bad of budget travel,singapore to penang return with tigerair you get to experience the good and bad of modern day budget travel with tigerair having booked a round trip i was able to print my boarding pass and go straight to the gate hence i could skip the long checkin line in the morning bus gate this flight probably due to costcutting and if you happen to be one of the unlucky few who decided to buy a boardmefirst option theyll board you first on the bus and not the plane unsurprisingly departure was delayed due to the need for the bus to loop several times to pick up passengers from the terminal return flight from penang was almost like a travellers heaven flight departed 30 minutes early as everyone had checked in at penang airport comfortably ahead of checkin cut off time it also helped that there was an aerobridge and wellorganised handling agents which meant passengers were all on board in less than 20 minutes arrival in singapore was of course 30 minutes early being a budget airline the service was almost nonexistant cant say that i dont like this airline as theyve performed well on the return leg for me but there is always room for improvement when it comes to departures from changi
1077,air berlin,5,i wish they had been nicer,bought my ticket one day in advance for 122 from berlin tegel to dusseldorf which was a very good deal i got to the airport early to check my bag and the guy told me my fare didnt include a checked bag fair enough he gave me a paper slip and had me go to the ticket sales office to pay they in turn sent me somewhere that had no sign so they had to tell me again where to go after finally being able to complete the transaction i went and got my bag tag the agent wasnt friendly and welcoming only functional the line to get through security was long and the waiting area tiny but thats all about tegel airport not air berlin boarding was fairly haphazard but they got the job done in time for departure we took off and landed a bit early with the lights off most of the way to dus as it was an early morning flight the flight attendants literally ran the cart through the aisle and sold drinks to maybe 3 passengers got my bag at dus mission accomplished but i wish they had been nicer
2888,air tahiti nui,3,we must respect distancing it is just impossible,food the food from a quality standpoint from tahiti to paris had nothing to do with being in business class seat comfort having selected a six abreast configuration on an ultra long haul flight it is just a no sense choice i was lucky enough to be seated on an aisle seat but for outboard pax on lh rh side it is just a headache to get access to the aisle this seat does not have enough personal belongings storage and feet area is just to narrow to have a great sleeping position lavatory the airline decided to lock the forward lavatory exclusively to crew it means 30 pc pax 30 pyc pax are sharing only two lavs near door 2 during these times when we must respect distancing it is just impossible this airlines needs to remember their revenue is coming from passengers
11809,japan airlines,8,comfortable premium economy,jal provided a comfortable premium economy cabin their product is enhanced by business lounge access at lhr and haneda the flight attendants were very attentive i did not use the wifi the food was identical to economy but was functional the only challenge was a not great selection of inflight entertainment in my view
21737,vietnam airlines,7,they board us by bus,hanoi to ho chi minh city i fly with vietnam airlines a lot i am their gold level frequent flyer i always like the staff consideration the food and to some extend the comfort of the cabin however there are 2 things that they really need to improve they use too many times the bus to bring the customer from gate to the airplane i got a bad experience today it is 35 degree in hanoi and they board us by bus as the sky priority customer i got to board first there is a stairs to bring us from gate to the bus the problem is that i have to wait under the heat for about 5 minute before the bus arrive this should not be the way an airline should treat its customer entertainment on aircraft is quite poor on a 2 hour domestic flight for a321 aircraft
15185,norse atlantic airways,3,comfort aboard is awful,greedy company 160 extra for 5 kilo exceeding weight this is unbelievable the ticket itself is not that cheaper from other company i tried and it will be first and last moreover the comfort aboard is awful luckily onboard crew is nice
9313,fiji airways,4,handled issue extremely poorly,suva to nadi we had originally booked a return ticket but the first part was cancelled due to the cyclone e mail but no follow up compensation or chance to rebook all their lines said busy anyway this was a short uneventful flight on fiji time in that it was late but being under half hour didnt matter check in was the most basic experienced and boarding was via steps from the back would not recommend as they handled the cyclone issue extremely poorly
4701,atlantic airways,8,a very good flight,copenhagen to vagar in the faroe islands with atlantic airways rc453 a319 aircraft friendly checkin received baggage tag and headed to the gate flight boarded in an organized fashion and flight attendants greeted each passenger as you entered the cabin nice colors and comfortable seats lots of legroom actually was very surprised ontime take off and 2 hours to the faroe islands soda water and coffee serviced complimentary but purchased wine and food was reasonably priced inflight entertainment was just the flightmap but had my dvds to watch landed a few minutes late in crazy wind and rain but the landing was good parked farthest possible on the tarmac from the entrance to the terminal so we all got wet but that is how it is there bags off in a reasonable amount of time oveall a very good flight and for the price a good deal
14750,mihin lanka,3,not recommend to fly mihin lanka,i ended up flying from colombo to muscat with mihin lanka as the ticket was cheap to return from a break in sri lanka firstly boarding was delayed and no announcement was made which can be frustrating as a traveller it would have been appreciated to have an explanation as to why we were not able to board on time then when all the passengers got called to board it was a manic rush anyways fast forward to boarding the plane the stewards greeted all passengers which was good and asked to check our seat however i found it odd that every single air steward i passed demanded to see my seat number maybe it was because people sat in the wrong seats after i got to my seat there was a female cabin staff who immediately told me to put my bag up in the cabin i explained that i was taking some things out for the flight she got another steward to then put my bag up in the cabin as all the others around me were full whilst i was sitting down i noticed how the female staff were quite arrogant and abrupt with some passengers especially the elderly which i thought was unacceptable one was walking up and down telling people they need to keep their bag underneath their seat and not put it in the cabins but in a rude manner from then on it just seemed like the cabin staff were rushing up and down serving the drinks and meals as quick as they could the food was actually not too bad though even though it was 4 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment which meant the flight was quite boring also the ac made the plane like an ice box and it wasnt until the end of the flight when they asked some passengers if they wanted a blanket i had already gotten out my sweater at this point so overall i wasnt happy with the service i would not recommend to fly mihin lanka they need to train up their staff on how to be more friendlier and compassionate to others as well as how to talk in a kinder less arrogantrude tone
22972,xiamen airlines,3,staff barely speak english,wuhan to amsterdam via xiamen my flight was cancelled due to bad weather conditions the company sent me an email in chinese stating that i had to rebook my flight but without giving any option of possible different solution once at the airport they were surprised i was asking to be rebooked on another flight andor reimbursed im going to try to follow up on this and see if i can get something but in general i didnt like the way they handle the problem they didnt care about leaving people at the airport without any support in addition both the airport and the cabin staff barely speak english so its very hard to communicate with them
21330,united airlines,1,flight was an all around disappointment,this flight was an all around disappointment while the flight attendants were friendly and were doing the best they could it was clear they were shortstaffed we sat at the back and at every meal they had run out of at least one of the offerings we had an unpleasant tasting vegetarian pasta for dinner and a very pathetic dry wrapped sandwich for lunch at sfo despite having a voucher offered by united for united club access the staff at the counter denied us entry because it was high season
2060,air koryo,6,air koryo customer review,pekfnj on tu204 check in quick and efficient at pek clean new aircraft seating reasonably comfortable and adequate for 2 hour trip was served bland meal but no worse than many other economy class meals service was efficient but cold drinks offered and free english language dprk literature entertaining pretake off video with politics included and inflight video showed happy images of the dprk quite reasonable flight noticeable that all nonkoreans were in the front economy cabin with the back cabin full of koreans pre take off and touchdown were marked by the happy playful music of an electronic band eerie but very much part of the dprk experience i was pleased to land given the safety reputation
16277,porter airlines,6,enjoyed flying with porter,ottawa to toronto enjoyed flying with porter to toronto city airport this is a great experience landing on toronto islands and getting to the city by walking down a tunnel for a couple of minutes porter is a small canadian airline connecting eastern canadian cities and having a couple of us cities in their destinations too as far as my single experience with porter it was a nice one
13391,lan peru,3,lan peru customer review,santiago lima in economy ended up being on a lan 767300 comfortable seating good food and great avod system limcuzlim a319 both ways flights on time seating comfortable small snack served on each journey with a drink crew friendly enough
11104,hop,9,services are good,hop provides since a few time a regular travel from pau to paris by small jets crj700 tickets are cheap and services are the same as air france so it is a good value i never had problem with this company im used to take services are good travel are all regional in france so very short seat comfort does not take the same part as longhaul
8131,dragonair,9,dragonair customer review,just did another trip on dragonair to busan korea hkgpus departs at 0230am with a320 before the cabin was becoming all dark cabin crew handed out a box of snack including a bun chocolate and some fruits along with a bottle of water limited seat pitch on a320 very good 3 hour flight for sleeping on the way back was departing at 8am korea time no ptv on the old a320 but nice yummy breakfast with korean style ginseng chicken with rice or scramble egg cabin crew were friendly and attentive as always hope their a320 will get new seats and ptv sometimes soon

13958,loganair,9,these flights are superb,travelled out on the tuesday morning flight from glasgow at 7am slight 20 mins delay but the flight now only takes about 35 mins in these newer jet engined planes instead ot the turbo props which used to be used on this route offered a drink and a snack with it which was nice and touched down enjoying some lovely scenery on the isle of lewis just after 8am back again on the 435 flight from stornoway to glasgow on the wednesday delayed 25mins due to the island air traffic control but again great flight and a snack and cup of tea some photos out over the scottish islands below then straight back into glasgow good flights slightly expensive but the ferry takes the best part of a day if you travel up from glasgow so these flights are superb and now there are 4 daily return flights
3947,alitalia,5,very different flight experiences,bari to london via rome and had 2 very different flight experiences i booked my flights several months ahead of travel for my summer holiday and found the alitalia site to be very efficient and user friendly alitalia emailed me a reminder to checkin online and so that side of things proved to be impressive and reliable checkin at bari was quick and the gentleman who checked me in made pleasant small talk and was very polite the flight from bari to rome was on an a320 the aircraft was clean and the interior well presented boarding was well managed and the flight departed slightly early and reached rome 10 mins ahead of schedule during this short flight the friendly and well turned out crew served drinks and were a great credit to their company disembarkation was most efficient and orderly i transferred from the domestic terminal to terminal e for the flight to london this flight was on a clearly older a320 boarding was not orderly as too many passengers had far too much hand luggage the flight was delayed for over 90 minutes on the runway and no announcements were made by the captain at all most of the cabin crew disappeared and left one lady to try and answer questions from worried passengers one passenger was told that storms over london had caused the delay and another person said there was power failure at heathrow this was all hearsay and not at all beneficial to passengers i noted how a captain from another airline was treated like a king by the cabin crew he was placed by the emergency seat and another passenger moved to enable this two mexican ladies sat next to me and were concerned about missing their flight to mexico city the same cabin crew member who fussed over the captain waved her hands at the mexicans and said it was not her job to know about connecting flights during this flight a small drink was served and a snack consisting of a micro packet of biscuits when i arrived at heathrow i found that my case had been broken i had to find a place to report this and was assisted by a young man who was clearly not coping well apparently quite a few bags on the flight did not even arrive in london i shall hesitate to use alitalia for international flights but should i need a domestic flight i shall consider them the poor communication was a great concern and the indifferent staff on the rome to london flight were a cause for concern
12527,jetstar japan,2,disregard for passenger comfort,after a recent horror of an experience flying with jetstar to honolulu and back id dreaded a prebooked trip from sydney to narita with a stop in cairns on the forward and aft leg they didnt disappoint in their complete disregard for passenger comfort it took 90 minutes to check in at narita on the return flight which left 1015 minutes to get through customs security leaving no time for a meal so we were forced to eat on board because i didnt have a credit card ready the food cart kept going an hour later i approached them and ordered the cabin staff told me it would take 20 minutes about an hour later i again asked them where it was as they were only too happy to take my card eventually it came during that time i observed about 56 cabin crew running around with first priority serving alcohol i was seated on the aisle of an emergency row seat and i saw no no preflight compliance check about willingness and capacity of how to assist in the event of an emergency and what our roles would be should the crew members be incapacitated its my last flight with this lot a pity as the fleet themselves are relatively new and crews on the flight decks are clearly competent but the handling of checkins and treatment of passengers by cabin crews are a bridge too far good bye
21701,vietnam airlines,2,told me that i wont get any refund,i booked a flight with vietnam airlines before the covid crisis as so many flights it got cancelled not their fault at all they offered me a rebooking which i had to pay an additional fee for now they cancelled my second flight too and told me that i wont get any refund not even a voucher this is unacceptable they keep my money make me pay a fee for a flight change and now keep that too
12971,korean air,5,certain tickets cannot book seats in advance,a very full flight as korean has cancelled the daily flight on this route due to the virus the crew did well trying to serve a meal and beverage service in 53 minutes my only moan is that with korean certain tickets cannot book seats in advance i even went to the airport and was told no with a virus around families need to sit together and not worry about being split up due to that attitude my score reflects that
7042,china southern airlines,9,professional ground staff,i booked flight tickets from guangzhou to london 4 times with different airlines and all of them were canceled for different reasons its not easy to travel everywhere you want from china in the current situation this was the fifth time i had bought a ticket to london and i was looking forward to my trip but on the morning of the day of the flight i received a call that i would not be able to board the flight due to capacity restrictions at london airport during the following ten hours i was told to wait for the phone call and someone would help me with this problem i was really desperate until my friend suggested i go to the airport directly and ask the ground staff to see if there is a better solution so i arrived at the airport 6 hours before my flight left i talked to the checkin desk manager who talked to me so warm and very kind and my hope was relighted by him after he knew my situation he did not make me wait and just try to help me to find a way to get on the flight he told me that if any other passenger cancel the trip i could take place the seat of the flight as a standby passenger and he kept my phone number and told me he would contact me as long as he get any news half an hour later i went back to his counter and he told me that i was very lucky that a passenger canceled the ticket and i was able to get on the plane then he have done my boarding pass very soon and showed me where to go for security just within 5 minutes i was so appreciative that everything this manager did now i have arrived in london and i am very grateful met such a professional ground staff with his help i saved time and plenty of money to rebook flight tickets
97,aegean airlines,4,poor customer service,party of 4 2 couples traveling together last minute 1 hour before our seats changed i upgraded everyone to row 11 now one is in 11 3 are in 26th row we were told the plane changed and we cant honor your seat selection poor customer service we were not the only party where the seats changed when i called customer service he stated well this happens occasionally
18042,silkair,6,such a disappointment,flight was delayed initially from 915pm to 945pm then became 1015pm no water or snacks given for the delay only apologies i chose silk air expecting to be punctual whilst other budget airlines serving singapore to penang route all boarded on time such a disappointment seat was ok and good enough for a short flight silkair has no personal ife cabin crews were not bad food is terrible only a wrap with fruits the real fruits are only 3 slices of watermelon while oranges are sweetened can ones it is ok to buy this flight if there is a promotion if not better buy budget airlines
15969,philippine airlines,3,the worst airport experience,the worker at los angeles that helped us at checkin was very accommodating and helpful the cabin crew helped us when we couldnt find a space in the overhead bin near our seats and informed us where they placed had no problems with entertainment flying back from manila is a completely different story the entertainment on mnl to lax kept buffering and the flight map showed multiple times that it was unavailable for the workers most of those on the manila to la flight looked like they hate their job the checkin worker was so strict on the weight of our carryon luggage so we had to remove some belongings which didnt happen to us in los angeles not one cabin crew member informed us where they placed our luggage when there was no overhead bin space near our seats so we had to wait for basically every passenger to leave so that we could find our luggage i dont know why there was such a discrepancy between the workers in lax vs mnl but the checkin and flight back was honestly the worst airport experience ive had so far
9518,firefly,8,professional and attentive,firefly is a very good lowcost airline flying from kuala lumpur to kuala terengganu the the ticket was not very expensive the airplane quality was good with high standard of cleaniness and comfortable seats the plane was less noisy than i expected for a propellor airplane during the flight we were served a complimentary drink and food i had a curry samosa cabin staff was extremely professional and attentive the big drawback of this airline is the number of flights cancelled on the way to kuala terengganu our flight was cancelled and we were put on a later flight the day i returned from kuala terengganu out of five daily flights three were cancelled one retimed it seems that the last flight of the day is the most reliable despite being a very good quality lowcost airline it might be unsuitable to those who have time constraints
10199,garuda indonesia,1,ground and cabin crew were very helpful,ga402 from jakarta to denpasar bali jakarta terminal3 was quite busy even though it was early morning however checkin was fast and efficient i was escorted through security and into the lounge by ms firyal from the garuda premium team ground staff when it came time to board ms firyal was on hand to help and assist onboard the cabin crew were quite busy serving breakfast and there were two choices i chose the omelet which was quite good and well prepared the cabin crew kept coming around and offering additional hot and cold drinks throughout the short flight although it was a short journey both the ground and cabin crew were very helpful
5266,bahamasair,1,bahamasair customer review,we were picked up in miami over 15 hrs late on way home we got to airport over 2 hrs ahead of time and waited for our flight flight listed as on time and they boarded us to leave on time but then had to sit in a very hot cabin for over 1hr because they were waiting for late comers to get through customs this made us miss all our flights out of miami and when i finally got to dallas missed any chance of getting home
4522,arik air,6,arik air customer review,i have flown arikair both long short haul a few times now and got mixed experiences the not so good experience was with the ground staff at lagos in may 2010 when i was harassed dispossessed of expensive perfume bottles 50mls each with contents even less i wrote a letter of complaint but never got a reply generally the services are fair but lack of online checking and ineffective communication has let it down i can also observe that the aircrafts are flown 12 or less full most of the time and wonder why prices are still up
856,air astana,6,review cabin crew training,almaty to istanbul please review your cabin crew training program kc 911 on 1706 delayed for 30 mins actually there were at least 3 flights which were delayed around of this time ground staff of air astana did excellent work even though it was crowded they handle situation professionally 5 star to ground staff except of one thing lady on the checkin counter told me that there is no delay of the flight when actually it was a delay for 30 mins i mean not a big deal and most probably delay wasnt announced to staff at that moment but fact is fact i would rather spend 30 mins with my beloved ones instead of crowded transit area if you can call almaty airport hall a transit area real bad experience starting with announcement of the flight not sure whose fault it is airport or airline but should be sorted you can not hear what staff announced it is simply hard to understand about which flight she was talking about sound had a really bad quality waiting area was crowded and too loud almaty airport is very old and small it should be replaced a long time ago the reason why im leaving this comment are cabin crew seriously guys you need to review your politics and training program as a constant customer you can see how quality is going down if supervisors and business class crew are still on track your junioreconomy staff is losing a mark crew was rude they commanded to do procedures before take off and when customers who may never flew before looked for explanation the answers were very sharp and again rude crew responded with single words time to time mixing it with russian and it was obvious that it was hard for them to express themselves in single sentence they gave an option of two meals as usual chicken and beef however during serving crew literally served us without asking anything when someone noticed that they would prefer beef crew responded that she would prefer beef as well but what is left is left same crew complained that she has to wait for customers when all of them visit restroom and because of what she is not able to serve the rest who were keep calling her
19115,srilankan airlines,5,worst experience ever,colombo to dubai i encountered the worst experience ever if youre travelling with kids please do not book this airline when i requested a bassinet for my 8 month old they refused it initially telling me that the bassinet will be too small but in reality it fit my baby perfectly the staff have a major attitude and they are thinking its giving from their hand or pocket
20139,thai lion air,2,ridiculous policy on carryon,bangkok to chiang mai ridiculous policy on carryon bags if your bag weighs more than 7k you have to take items out of your bag and hold them i ended up walking with my backpack neck pillow toiletry bag running shoes and make up bag it was so inconvenient that i just put my stuff back in my bag but there was another scale at the gate before boarding so we had to go through the process again when we got on the plane we stowed the carry on bags and just put all the extra items up in the overhead compartments completely defeating the purpose of lightening our bags once seated my partner and i took out our lunches that wed packed only to be told that in fact outside food isnt allowed on the planethere were no signs or announcements outlining this policy we had to sneak bites of our food during the flight when we landed the airline operated shuttle bus was broken and we had to stand in the isles holding all of our items that had been pulled from our bags for 25 minutes overall it was a pretty funny experience weird policies attempt to make more money by charging baggage fees and making people buy food on the plane and one inconvenience after another
8063,dragonair,9,cabin crew are very nice,dragonair is part of cathay pacific from hong kong to guangzhou is less than 100 miles but they provide an excellent service when on board cabin crew deliver a bottle of water and a cookie the cabin crew are very nice
16404,qantas airways,3,please wake up qantas,perfunctory interesting word one applicable to this flight service from cgk to syd i dont know whats happened with qantas since the pandemic but for sure there has been a major decline in onboard service my issues dont stem from no welcome and totally ignored even as oneworld emerald dwelling on that would seem petty and entitled rather on the following no amenity kits for economy look on an overnight flight you would expect eye shades and a tooth brush nine given out and none in the pockets of my row no coffee or tea served before landing on a red eye flight the cabin lights come on usually an hour before landing coffee is normally served nothing this flight i wouldnt mind if this was airasia but i am paying almost 1500 for a cgksydwgn trip small things indeed count please wake up qantas having flown recently on your one world partners cathay qatar and jal i can assure you youre being left way way behind
4650,asiana airlines,8,the staff were exemplary,sydney to istanbul via seoul wonderful staff and even though it was an older plane the seat was comfortable with good legroom unfortunately the entertainment choices were limited and the equipment was poor and old luckily the korean films were very entertaining and had english subtitles because none of the other world movies did the plane was delayed one hour on the runway in sydney whilst they waited for the meals and again when a passenger didnt feel well however we made up the time in the air the sydney to incheon leg was a day flight leaving in the morning however the blinds were closed for the 9 hour trip the same happened from incheon to istanbul again a day flight of 9 hours so it was quite stuffy particularly because the cabin temperature was warm i preferred the excellent korean food over the western meal and kept hydrated with tonnes of water rather than trying their alcohol all flights were full but the staff were exemplary remaining patient and smiling the toilets were surprisingly always clean and in order
21133,tunisair,6,tunisair customer review,lhrtun return both legs were on 2 of the older a320s in the fleet which are showing their age the flight from lhr left 1 hour later than the std however this was due to the aircraft arriving late from tunis upon return the flight left 45 minutes late as there was no ramp staff in tunis to load the baggage and hence we had to wait for these to become available to load the baggagecargo before we could depart the food even by airline food quality is very poor however the seating in economy is very impressive both in width and pitch it must also be said that the cabin crew are extremely helpful and very polite
16505,qantaslink,8,qantaslink customer review,flew the dash 8 400 service from melbourne to adelaide over the weekend i really like the dash 8 aircraft and enjoy qantaslinks service the aircraft was approximately 30 full on todays flight the cabin manager was very engaging and always smiling whilst her offsider had that bad qf attitude that their famous for we were served a small refreshment which came in a small box consisting of feta cheese crackers some chocolate and mints and a beer the journey over to adelaide was generally a good one and will continue to use qf for this dash 8 service
19253,sun country airlines,3,i will be reconsidering book with them going forward,boarded 10 minutes late sat on the plane for an hour and a half while they loaded mail and waited 20 more minutes for live chickens to be loaded you dont book a 750am flight to depart at 940 because of mail and chickens made everyone late i will be reconsidering book with them going forward
18703,south african airways,4,there are no snacks on board,cape town to london via johannesburg i will start with a few positives about the experience the staff are personable and the meal service is conducted quickly to allow the maximum sleep time on the jnblhr route access is provided to an arrivals lounge which is essential as the airlines serves only powdered coffee now for the many negatives these relate primarily to the seat and to the airlines schedule instability the aircraft was the advertised a330200 these are widely marketed as lieflats by the airline and independent websites however they are angled at about 170 deg and uncomfortable for sleeping saa is rare in having a different business class seating product on each longhaul aircraft type and also unusual to go from the extremely comfortable and 2metre long long lieflats on the a340600 back to an angled version the schedule is unstable i was booked on sa354 at 1705 saa did not inform either my travel agent or me of the change in flight plans it was only by chance that i had wifi access and attempted an online checkin to notice we had been rebooked on sa346 at 1500 this flight operates 2 hours earlier than our original booking for much of our trip we were in the bush and off grid so would have missed the flight if we had been coming from elsewhere this lack of communication of a significant flight change is terrible as we would have missed the flight had we turned up for a 1705 departure on checkin it became apparent that the sa352 at 1605 was cancelled and passengers being moved from sa352 to sa354 however a 5hour wait at jnb was not expected or particularly welcome and no attempt was made to move us to the earlier sa234 from jnb to lhr staff professionalism staff chatted in the galleys throughout the night on both lhr flights which disrupted sleep despite ear plugs furthermore my request if a snack might be available before the breakfast service commenced only to be told there are no snacks on board other airlines on similar flight lengths would at the very least be able to offer a pack of nuts or crackers
17426,sa express,5,carrier imposed fees,george to johannesburg we book tickets for our two grandchildren twice a year as they have to fly as unaccompanied minors i have to make the booking through the call center the fare indicated on the website for the specific flights was r1 18221 per person for the return flights between johannesburg and george before i gave all the traveler details i asked the operator what i would have to pay and was informed that it would be r236442 per child this excluded the r10000 per ticket to be charged because i booked through the call center when i called back to find out if the children had been accepted as unaccompanied minors for the flight and to make the payment the amount was suddenly r295722 per child that is 25 times more than when one would and could book on the internet on checking the eticket per childone finds the following info fare calculation r69750 x 2 r1 39500 rounded off to r1 40000 plus taxes totaling r46122 and carrier imposed fees r 109600 which brings the total to r2 95722 per child
10254,garuda indonesia,6,hopefully it was just a oneoff,jakarta to sydney i used bid upgrade to get the business seat in this flight and perhaps that was the reason i felt ignored unlike few previous experience with garuda when we purchased the business class tickets outright all the ground experience was fine on boarding the fa came around offering drinks and taking notes on what the breakfast choice to be then i went off sleeping until i heard sounds of plates and cutlery as sign of they were starting serving breakfast i was not served my breakfast even though i turned my seat upright fas just walked pass me back and forth at first i thought i should just wait maybe mine will come soon it did not until we landed no one asked if id like anything to drink i had to ring the bell to ask for a cup of coffee and it was too late to ask for breakfast then once we landed the fa who took my order came to me and said i was sleeping soundly that she did not want to wake me up hence i skipped breakfast the fact that i sat there the entire time they served breakfast and kept asking my neighbor passengers what else theyd like felt like an insult to me would i fly with garuda again yes if we are flying to indonesia but never use the big upgrade anymore its such a shame that i have always recommended them before as we have always received great hospitality prior hopefully it was just a oneoff occasion and not a new trend for garuda
17262,ryanair,9,two on time flights,two on time flights with the return flight even landing 20 minutes early both flights very friendly cabin crew and clean cabin seats are not that bad and legroom space is not worse or better then other airlines i have flown this route with ryanair many times and surely use their services in the near future again one more due compliment to ground staff in charleroi checkin with two suitcases took exactly 30 seconds
15569,onur air,5,onur air customer review,used the stanstead to ercan route and returned a week later although i can have no complaints whatsoever about the crew or the flights i have strong reservations about the very cramped seating on both journeys i am just over 6 feet tall and found myself in considerable pain from having little or no leg room although it was not the airlines fault the return journey was made worse by taking over 105 minutes in line waiting to check in at ercan whilst staff hand wrote the boarding passes and luggage labels it left us with barely 10 minutes to shop before rushing onto the aircraft which then spent over an hour on the ground in turkey as it was an early morning flight over 200 disgruntled people finally left the cramped plane i had a great holiday in a northern cyprus but would never want to repeat the experience of bad seating and rubbish checking in procedures i will look elsewhere in future
8472,egyptair,1,i will never use egyptair,we were scheduled for our initial flight 850 from nairobi to cairo at 425 am in business class minutes before boarding the airport display showed one hour delay and according to the staff from egyptair a flat tire needed to be replaced hours had passed by with no real indication as to what the situation was and passengers had become very frustrated demanding answers after five long hours one of the executive representatives of egyptair mentioned to all of the passengers they were going to put up in a hotel because they couldnt find a spare tire for the aircraft we waited another two hours for the bus transportation and hotel accommodations the whole deal was horrifying with the transition of getting a new visa to enter back into the country the business class lounge had no real accommodating nourishing food it was basically appetizers and finger food that couldnt hold our nurturing standers for the long hours the bus transportation had no ac we were stuffed with our luggage and belongings into the bus like sardines being on top of each other not having any personal space or being mindful of covid19 i will never use egyptair or recommend it to anyone
13205,kuwait airways,1,friendly and competent staff,bangkok to rome via kuwait i have already flown with kuwait airways and i think ill book even for this winter new aircraft on time friendly and competent staff both onboard and on the ground and the dasman lounge in kuwait airport is a real pleasure to spend time on coincidence restaurantbar fornitissimo smokingroom inside where they offer you arabian coffee efficient wifi clean bathrooms as not seen at other airports there are no alcoholic beverages but on long trips you have to hydrate yourself with water
20832,transavia,5,they do not impress with anything,they are ok but they do not impress with anything they usually leave a little later than scheduled and they dont serve anything for free unlike klm
17496,sata air azores,6,was pleasantly surprised,wasnt feeling very confident flying with the airline due to the reviews but was pleasantly surprised crew was professional and courteous food on both legs was surprisingly good and there were several options for drinks really short transfer at pdl which went by seamlessly however the seats are not very comfortable and the wifi connectivity only provides you with access to their ife portal which has a limited but decent quality selection considering this is a relative small airline based in an archipelago in the middle of the ocean i appreciate the fact that its not a no frills experience would definitely fly with them again as someone who really wants to visit the azores
5742,blue islands,5,blue islands customer review,i have been impressed with the three blue islands flights i have been on in the last couple of years from guernsey to alderney and twice to jersey the lounge service in guernsey is excellent and all the staff very friendly and professional my passport which i accidentally left on the plane this week following a flight to jersey this week was retrieved quickly and given back to me in the arrivals hall which i was very pleased about
7723,croatia airlines,9,croatia airlines customer review,bcnzagsjj on a319q400 checkin at bcn poor you in fact use lufthansas desks which is inefficient auto machines followed by bag drop but no reference anywhere to use it after problems at bcn we left late good cold dinner served onboard with nice croatian wine worn out a319 curtains closed for business class despite it being empty arrived only 10 mins late short transit at zag where everything was closed despite all the flights arrivingdeparting at that time prop flight to sarajevo comfortable and quick just 35mins on brand new q400 snack and drink served onboard efficient and friendly staff throughout one of the best flights ive had with this airline over the years they seem a bit hit and miss irrespective of domestic or international flights
5792,blue1,6,blue1 customer review,blqhel which they fly 2 weekly during the summer a bit of a random route but the flight was full due to very cheap fares i got in on an ow for 107 incl all taxes flight departed about 35 minutes late and a little time was made up en route plane was spotlessclean with blue1s new seats service was generally ok but everything is now forpurchase including soft drinks not sure how they can call themselves a fullservice airline like that bologna is a disaster of an airport with the construction and there was only one agent for checkin for the entire flight and nothing for g well for the price this can slide
10448,germanwings,3,germanwings customer review,flew back from cologne on the 10th december flight returned after 20 minutes due to technical faults attempted to reboard 2 hours and 10 minutes after original flight time but was told catering being loaded onto replacement thus further delay meaning flight delayed to 3 hrs 15 mins no complaint forms as promised no non eu passenger cards given not a budget airline at 327 for 2 return tickets from lhr best avoided the rep in cologne treated the whole episode as a joke
13248,la compagnie,5,my flight was cancelled,newark to paris i booked the flight back in june 2016 a couple of weeks later i received an email that my flight was cancelled for 2 september 2016 due to planned mechanical work for the plane and had to reschedule the flight i had two connecting flights that i had to rebook to accommodate the change but i had to pay both airlines 200 each to rebook i asked for help from la compagnie but all they would say was they were sorry even though they are the ones to cancel the original flight 2 months out to top matters i had to return home early and changed days to return thru la compagnie and they charged me 800 to change i asked for some help with the 800 fee i mentioned the cost of the original flight changes cost to me and again all i received was i am sorry but nothing i can do
18662,south african airways,3,the staff seemed agitated,johannesburg to dar es salaam with south african airways the cabin crew on this flight seemed like they did not want to be there serving the passengers there were instances where the staff seemed agitated by some of the requests of the passengers in front of us and were very unprofessional and borderline rude
21591,uzbekistan airways,3,uzbekistan airways customer review,hy brings you from a to b best not to expect anything else shjtas hy332 with a320 on time departure and arrival no entertainment system poor food quality crew not motivated airplane more or less proper toilets rather dirty seats standard tasdxb hy333 with b767 on time departure and arrival ife does not offer films in english poor food quality airplane proper except toilets blankets smelt crew unmotivated standard seats
18811,southwest airlines,6,eyeopening and frustrating,my wife and i have been traveling on southwest for nearly three decades and generally appreciate their service or that they do their best to be helpful when travel plans go sideways in fact we just had a trip through southwest vacations that was fantastic our latest experience with them however has been both eyeopening and frustrating we had booked flights for february 2nd from puerto vallarta to reno with a connection in phoenix we had flight 1299 from puerto vallarta to phoenix and then flight 547 from phoenix to reno we received an email from southwest notifying us that our flights were changed from puerto vallarta to denver and then denver to reno we had seen this denver connection when we were initially booking our trip however we did not want to fly from mexico to denver in the dead of the winter too much of a chance of being stuck in mexico i went on the southwest website and could see that our original flights through phoenix and on to reno were still there and they were still selling tickets for these flights i called southwest customer service and asked that our flights be changed back to our original flights the customer service representative changed us back to the original 1299 flight puerto vallarta to phoenix but informed us heres where things got wonky that we could no longer choose our original phoenix to reno flight 547 because the two flights were no longer linked in their system i asked her what she meant by that apparently southwest links certain flights together so when you search for a flight from a to b with a connection in between it will only show you these linked flights there may be other connecting flights that are departing earlier or later depending on your needs but you will not see them because they are not linked flights in their system so our original flights were linked when we booked them but were then unlinked and changed by southwest to denver and when i tried to change them back i was told that is no longer an option because those two flights are no longer linked the only linked flight through phoenix was a 5hour and 20 minute layover in phoenix and then a flight stopping in vegas and traveling on to reno i pointed out to southwest that there was an earlier flight 867 through vegas and on to reno with only a 2 hour and 10 minute layover i was told that was not an option because that was not a linked flight seriously you changed our flights you unlinked our original flights and refuse to do anything to restore our original flights or alleviate the lengthy delay you left us with cmon southwest you can do better at the end of most flights the flight attendant will say we know you have a choice in flying and we thank you for flying southwest and so my wife and i will spend our 5 hour and 20 minute layover contemplating our future travel plans and considering if its time to exercise that choice
5038,avianca,2,the service is very bad,avianca is a low cost airline with normal carrier ticket prices the service is very bad not even water in 5 hour flight they change class of ticket without reimbursement
3176,airasia,9,so nice to welcome back airasia,its so nice to welcome back airasia after almost a 2 years absence since the start of the pandemic after having had a few bad experience with malaysia airlines quite recently i chose air asia for the value of money on christmas day flight was on time check in at the airport was orderly premium flex customers perks and priority were observed boarding by the zone was very orderly also plane is clean and crew were lovely and welcoming it really pays to get the exit row for the extra leg room and comfort my preordered meal of bukhara chicken rice was delicious ad spicy and it came with a small bottle of water i was impressed at how efficient the crew worked and they kept the 2 toilets clean at regular intervals as well landing was so smooth too luggage delivered in a timely manner and in good condition for someone who is used to flying premium airlines in business class i must say this was a very inoressive experience i think in future for medium to short haul flights i really dont mind to fly with them and save some money as well maybe party is also because nowadays many premium airlines cut costs so much that more and more they resemble budget airlines except for the price tag
6499,caribbean airlines,5,caribbean airlines customer review,portofspain miami return service at piarco atrocious and sloppy in the early morning people should be vibrant and happy not sloppy and rude which was the case flight attendants nice and hot meals on both legs ife started with caribbean essence with no audio then all screens went blank for the rest of the trip no one even bothered to explain the technical difficulty on return meal was mashed potatoes and bbq chicken with the amount of gravy in the meal it turned out to be a soup ife audio and video were not working properly so it was difficult to understand the movie again no explanation to even apologize for the inconvenience clean planes with comfortable seating i am only using this airline because american airlines is no better
18065,silkair,4,limitations of the aircraft,cairns to singapore this was a long and tiring flight on a boeing 737 silkair tries to make the best of a bad situation but the sad truth is that a 7 hour flight requires flat bed seats in business class and that can be accomplished only in a bigger aircraft like a 777 the seats do not recline enough to withstand a 7 hour flight the lounge at cairns is compact but sufficient the in flight attendants were good but were again stymied by the limitations of the aircraft there is very limited in flight entertainment silkair must either operate the 777 on this segment or simply hand over this route to singapore airlines
17991,sichuan airlines,4,departure nearly an hour late,dayong to chongqing with sichuan airlines very disappointed as previous experience with sichuan airlines had been positive flight departure time came and went without any indication of a problem the plane had arrived on time and was well visible from the departure lounge with an eventual chaotic busbased boarding from a rearranged gate departure was nearly an hour late staff appeared as browned off with life as the passengers
18029,silkair,1,its not worth it,brisbane to singapore via cairns short staffed so poor food service seats and plane was wornout with major wear and tear small plane need to use own phone for in flight entertainment for 65 hour flight with nowhere to charge your phone i wouldnt even give 1 for this flight its better to book flight with no stopover in regional areas even if i have to pay 300 extra its not worth it
17877,shanghai airlines,5,shanghai airlines customer review,flight fm846 29 dec hong kong to shanghai flight left 40 minutes late paid quite a bit extra and given it was only 8 seats you would expect reasonable service and have a bit of peace and quiet but it seems that if you are in economy you just use any toilet this was business class you pay the extra for the trimmings and expect a higher level of service and cabin separation normally because you have paid more you get a mini bus for business class passengers but there were none will be wary of code share flights from now on
5744,blue islands,5,blue islands customer review,gcisou very good value everything included in the headline price no extras nice little lounge at guernsey for free drinks and biscuits dornier 328 very comfortable aircraft
6384,cape air,4,cape air customer review,bosalbogs leg 1 we were about 10 minutes late due to weather cant control mother nature we more than made up for the delay by arriving a little bit early we had a great tail wind leg 2 arrived 15 minutes early i grew up with this airline and hope it continues on into the future
17203,rwandair,9,cabin crew were attentive,dubai to libreville via kigali was comfortable with flight as cabin crew were attentive and available clean and arranged flights all the way through didnt enjoy transfer at kigali however as airport was not as organized as flight
20009,thai airways,8,nice and easy flight,first time i was flying back at 1pm rather than 1am i thought i was going to struggle that wasnt to be the case nice and easy flight i do tend to find flying back physically easier maybe not mentally food was good and a sufficient amount of movies to watch only downside was the flight seemed to take a lot longer than ever before verging on 13 hours plus
16718,regional express,5,delayed nearly 3 hours,regional express flight from albury to sydney delayed nearly 3 hours we were notified 45 mins before planned departure however not the reason if this was a mechanical delay then its reasonable to expect that if it is fixed early we can board early so we continued to the airport however on arrival we find it is a crew rest delay so there is a fixed time delay which passengers should be notified about so that they dont have to wait in the airport while the crew sleeps
2481,air namibia,3,air namibia customer review,frankfurt to windhoek return economy check in no problem flights on time seats ok food reasonable outward leg was the first time i have ever been cold at the back of an airbus in flight service disappointing crew did the minimum they could get away with on occasions were actually rude uncaring and ignored requests for assistance main screen entertainment only with non functioning headphones i do not recommend air namibia but they have little competition to push standards up german um pah music during boarding and disembarking amused the germans as well as the brits
7761,csa czech airlines,4,check in staff extremely rude,frankfurt to prague check in staff at the airport was extremely rude shouting talking over having conversations passing staff while holding my id in her hand there are no standards
20251,thai smile airways,8,service was great from every step,the service was great from every step the check in process was easy and the attendant was patient and polite the flight attendants were welcoming and prompt my ticket included checked luggage at no additional charge i will consider thai smile in the future when flying
7089,china southern airlines,9,we were assisted by ground staff,i was a little worried about the recent epidemic in guangdong the temperature in guangzhou was 37 degrees and we saw no less than 50 china southern staff customs and border control officers waiting for us in protective clothing after disembarking from the plane we were placed in our seats to wait for the epidemiological investigation while we waited we were assisted by ground staff to check our customs declaration after the investigation we were guided through the sampling process i was reassured by the social distance that needed to be maintained at each step of the process and the fact that everyone was seen to be disinfected when they left their seats i would also like to thank one of the staff at china southern airlines when i got to the sampling area i realised that my ipad left it on the plane she saw me rummaging through it and asked if i needed any help i was grateful for her help as the ipad contained important documents for my work
14375,mahan air,8,overall a good flight,mahan air from kuala lumpur to tehran check in was fast and friendly the signage to find the premier lounge in kuala lumpur airport was almost nonexistent and took me a while to locate the lounge which offered minimum amenities boarding was efficient and the a340600 was packed for this flight the aircraft interior was new and clean with smiling crew the flat bed was great and plenty of food was offered for this 8 hour flight perhaps the refreshment pizza and a burrito at the end of the flight was a bit too much only negative thing i can think of was not much entertainment and it was limited to public lcds considering the business class fare was almost 40 cheaper than other airlines which operated indirect service it was a good buy i was especially impressed by the very attentive flight attendants overall a good flight
6879,china airlines,8,very comfortable product,taipei to vancouver very comfortable product seat and food excellent especially for a long total journey after transit in tpe service attentive but not over the top drinks a little limited but pleasant enough inflight wifi fast and tpe lounge generally comfortable too although did start to get a bit crowded
10341,germania airline,6,no agreement with eurowings,sharm el sheikh to dusseldorf when i got to the airport i found out that my flight was delayed by 50 minutes i had asked the ground staff to please check my luggage through to hamburg as i had a connecting flight with eurowings from dusseldorf the agent informed me that he could easily check me through but he would need the permission from germania he wrote an email to them and so i had to wait about 45 minutes until he had shown me their response the response stated that they had no agreement with eurowings and that i would need to pick up my luggage and check it in with them again as the flight was already delayed by 50 minutes i would miss my connecting flight in dusseldorf to hamburg when i had arrived in dusseldorf i had found out that my luggage was not carried on my flight lucky me my connecting flight was cancelled theoretically the ground service does not even deserve a one star rating the crew on the other side was very friendly and provided great service seat on the aircraft was very comfortable and i had enough space for my legs as well
21568,uzbekistan airways,5,dont expect much,new york to tashkent uzbekistan airways offers direct flights from jfk the fleet has some relatively new boeing 787 but dont expect much beyond knowing youll get there relatively quickly theres no online checkin on the website so arrive at least 3 hours early for international flights and expect to queue food is ok coming from nyc very mediocre coming from tashkent lots of screaming kids running laps in the aisles so bring earplugs or music entertainment system has lots of russianuzbek movies but the worst dubbing ive ever encountered rather than removing the russian soundtrack they simply put the english translation over it so that both play simultaneously the english translation is just that one guy reading all the male character parts with a russian accent and a woman doing all the female parts
18443,sky express airlines,1,will never use it again,santorini to athens my mom and i had a flight booked for 315pm we had a second flight leaving athens at 645pm the sky express flight was delayed more than 4 hours in santorni because of the day befores wind storm they did not tell us in enough time to get to athens via ferry or another airline they barely gave any information there were tons of other flights going out and my mom and i could have booked another but they kept saying we were leaving then by the time we left with no food my mom boarded with some chips the flight attendant said she had to put them away and she said she hadnt eaten in more than four hours the flight attendant snapped back and said she hadnt eaten in 5 hours she was extremely rude to my mom and this was on mothers day we missed out flight in athens and had to pay for a whole new flight no help was given and no money back our new flight was leaving the next day so we had to pay for an overnight in a hotel the taxi there and back to the airport and we didnt get our money back from the hotel in bucharest this airline cost us over 500 and no apology was given we will never use it again
19733,tam airlines,5,tam airlines customer review,someone had mention in reviews that it was too cold during the flight well it should be an advantage our flight from london to sao paulo was a nightmare due to lack of air conditioning on i prefer to wrap in blankets and extra clothes rather than not having any air at all we asked staff several times to turn it on but nothing happened staff were very friendly though good entertainment panel
10764,gulf air,7,price was ridiculously cheap,london to bangkok via bahrain price was ridiculously cheap booked a week prior to departure free seat selection 24 hours prior to departure aircraft nearly new boeing 787900 with decent seat pitch and immaculately clean poor seat width as with all 9 abreast carriersso vacant adjacent seat welcome ife reasonable choice but could be expanded nice too that no ife boxes under seat limiting leg room as with some carriers service nice to have an amenity kit on night flights but dental kit inside would be good food nothing to rave about but appropriate for times and flight length cabin staff were not overly warm or welcoming but did what they had to do bahrain airport shambles and useless would choose again for the right price
1371,air china,5,cabin looking quite dirty,a long flight 10h cabin luggage allowance is very low 5kg the boarding process went well in milan the aircraft itself is average no signs of modernity cabin looking quite dirty small pitch in economy seats although it is said to exist wifi was never available very little variety of movies or series to watch the catering is of basic quality and the crew is not particularly nice flight was in time
16063,phuket air,5,phuket air customer review,pleased with our experience on phuket air flight out was a little dissapointing as they were old seats with little recline but we were the only two in business class so were treated like royalty the best staff i have encountered return was different much improved seating with cradle style resulting in a good nights sleep but the food wasnt quite as good i would fly phuket air business class again such a good deal
4598,asiana airlines,9,incredibly kind and helpful,bangkok to los angeles via seoul on asiana first time with this airline my family and i were all very pleasantly surprised to the level of service food quality attention to details such as tooth brush and personal kit even in economy the flight attendant were all incredibly kind and helpful unlimited drinks and the food was delicious my original business class ac flight was cancelled due to covid i had not flown in economy overseas in over a decade and was very apprehensive with the long distance not that i would fly economy again but if i had to asiana would be my first choice thank you for making this trip more pleasant
16103,play,2,passive aggressive and sarcastic,bought 2 tickets one person couldnt make it so i changed the name of the passenger for 190 the second passenger couldnt make it for the same ticket so the ticket was cancelled play kept the ticket fare for the cancelled ticket however refused to refund the name change fee for a ticket nobody used when complained they stated this is their terms and conditions refused to give rationale for their costs and the person dealing with it was passive aggressive and sarcastic when you insure your tickets read the small print there arent many circumstances when youll get your money back
8047,delta air lines,5,strictly chaotic once we got to atlanta,we arrived in atlanta from london with almost 3 hours to wait the flight was to leave at 615 in the evening but around 530 we were told that there was a weather problem and would be delayed until 7 oclock at about 655 they change the delayed time to 720 and the plane started to load and was completed by about 730 or 735 and we left the gate headed to the runway while on the runway we got ready to takeoff but then the engines were cut back and we returned to the gate they said that the weather had closed and they couldnt takeoff they also said that they had been notified that the pilots time has run out and that they would have to have new pilots so we sat on the plane for about an hour and a half until the new pilot got there they said they were having problems getting clearance to leave the gate but by the time they did surprise the attendant time had run out and now we had to wait another hour while they found new staff we finally left at about 1030 getting us home at about 1210 where we shouldve been home a little after eight i dont understand how they couldnt see the time running out coming for both the pilot and the crew well before it was the time to leave it just seems like poor management i could understand the weather problem but the pilots time running out within minutes of taking off doesnt seem to make much sense and then the attendance time runs out like nobody knew that was coming very very unhappy with that situation the flight going over to ireland and the flight back from london to atlanta was fine but strictly chaotic once we got to atlanta
18690,south african airways,3,not a pleasant experience,johannesburg to hong kong i am not having a pleasant experience due to this flight sa286 boarding was on time but then with all passengers on board flight was delayed by almost an hour with sketchy explanations from the cabin crew to start eventually after simmering in the plane for too long the pilot tells us that the reason why we havent taken off is because it is too hot needs to be 27 to fly and it was still 28 if it was too hot then i feel it is inhumane to load us in and make us wait in the sweltering plane for an hour before taking us on our 12 hour flight surely they could have explained that upfront and adjusted the boarding time accordingly then the inflight entertainment system was faulty but luckily after 2 restarts equating to over another hour it worked alright again for the rest of the trip there is no cellphone charging for economy class i thought that was standard these days particularly if there was going to be the threat of no inflight entertainment in the morning one toilet sink was overflowing approaching hong kong they had to apologise for the lack of arrival cards for passengers due to the delay i have missed my connecting flight which was supposed to be at 2pm and can only go at 545pm now
11832,japan airlines,1,all my expectations were overly met,this review is based on my own flying experience i have never travelled internationally japan airlines 7878 dreamliner flight number 746 was the first international flight i had this airline as a whole is superb i almost forgot that we are flying thousands of feet above air because of the warm welcome and support by japan airlines 746 cabin crew on board we are in a pandemic but even though the cabin crew were covered with face masks it didnt hinder them in showcasing the real smiles of how we are welcomed and accommodated on board i worked in customer service for over a decade now and this jal cabin crew delivered an exceptional support and service thank you jal flight 746 for your best among the rest support and service dont worry about your ticket i had the lowest economy ticket but as a customer all my expectations were overly met
16300,porter airlines,3,do not communicate delays,toronto to newark if you want to depart at 6 get a ticket for 4 it is not only impossible for this airline to leave on time they do not communicate delays of course no one expects much from airlines but the level of sheer disrespect to customers by porter is out of control if youre returning to toronto in the evening that delay might cause you to be rerouted with no compensation horrible customer service avoid if possibleit is surely a first world complaint but few things cause me as much annoyance as porter airlines
422,aerolineas argentinas,1,more than 8 hours waiting,horrible service flight from buenos aires to rio de janeiro supposed to depart at 1820 on the 31st may 2019 and it was delayed to 215am the next morning more than 8 hours waiting and no one knows anything gave us a voucher to eat in a poor place called la churrasquita should give a voucher that we choose where we eat and a place to stay and sleep
19662,tam airlines,5,just hope things improve,london to sao paulo with tam airlines left london on time cabin staff very helpful and plane clean and comfortable food served for dinner and breakfast ok although only 1 alcoholic drink offered with dinner vod worked with latest films and water offered during the night arrived on time at sao paulo and then disaster struck eventually informed after 1 hour wait that onward flight to santiago would not be departing at 730am but 10pm after walking around the airport and queueing for 2 hours and retrieving luggage we were eventually given vouchers for a taxi to dump of a hotel on the outskirts of soa paulo stuck there all day no leisure facilities industrial buildings surrounding the hotel and having to arrange hotel shuttle bus back to airport have several more flights booked with tam airlines on package holiday to south america so just hope things improve
3649,aircalin,9,aircalin customer review,we travelled to noumea on this airlinecode share with qantas on the outgoing leg and aircailin on the return leg the outgoing trip with qantas was so substandard with qantas there was no entertainment we could see only two screens out of 5 visible in our section of the cabin and the meal served was inedible however to my surprise the service was fantastic the food was not only edible but enjoyable the service was swift polite and plentifulthe brandy at the end of the meal was a lovely touch individual screen for movies was also much appreciated i would have no hesitation in flying this airline again or recommending it to friends
5781,blue panorama airlines,2,fly a different airline,rome to tirana worst airline i have known checked in and when time to board came nothing happened flight got delayed by 6 hours and then 6 hours later boarding got delayed again everything is bad about this airline do yourselves a favour and fly a different airline even if its a bit more expensive
7626,corsair,9,corsair customer review,first time on this airline was quite hesitant at first but price was too good to let go flew from montreal to paris and back on 747 checked in luggage and had a carry on on the way to paris sat on upper deck on the way back lower deck far back on an aisle seat both flights on time paris flight was actually early no trouble with luggage food was decent with excellent staff overall very nice experience would definitely recommend
10374,germanwings,9,impressed with germanwings,very impressed with germanwings the flight was punctual crew was professional and polite i traveled smart economy boarding was quick and efficient the aircraft was clean the lavs were spotless there was good legroom and we were given a choice of beverages and substantial snack the arrival was ontime and luggage was delivered promptly
2470,air namibia,6,air namibia customer review,i had booked a return trip from lgw to whk about 2 weeks before my scheduled departure from gatwick i stumbled across information by chance on the internet that air namibia had axed all its flights from gatwick they never informed me of it at all later i found out it was because i had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent people who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently so i phoned their representatives who were still active in london the agent who took my call was very helpful though she rescheduled my flight without issues with ba via frankfurt she had also assured me that i could check my bags straight through from heathrow to windhoek of course this ended up not being the case the lady at the ba counter at heathrow knew of no such cooperation with air namibia she said i had to recheck the bags in at frankfurt i didnt mind though otherwise my flights were on time and i got to windhoek without any other hassle the return journey was flawless bags checked through all the way to heathrow from windhoek via frankfurt i would fly them again
1043,air berlin,3,checkin staff unfriendly and impatient,tel aviv to berlin with air berlin so everything starts in the airport we arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight the checkin staff were really unfriendly and impatient told us that the flight was full and we cant move for another seats we sat near the toilet but when we arrived at the airplane we saw a lot of free seats after the takeoff we were expecting for a little snack or a sandwich but we didnt get anything the whole flight its unbelievable because we paid 800 per ticket i dont know whats the problem with air berlin because its not the first time i am flying with them at the past they were an excellent airline not recommended
16857,royal air maroc,6,seats in business class are the best,the flight was a red eye which are always stressful on passengers and crew the seats on the ram 787 in business class are the best i have experienced i am 192 cm and can lie easily flat the cabin crew were below average catering was disappointing though the portions were generous but never reflective to the rich moroccan heritage except for the moroccan tea ife was awful with a very poor selection of movies tv and games
5838,bmi regional,9,a most efficient service,stansted to derry this is a most efficient service with every aspect of it being handled professionally i love being able to check a large bag in and not having staff say that it is too big too heavy etc the air stewardess on my flight was so accommodating to people who had difficulties with managing the steps and overall had a lovely disposition the planes are never overcrowded on this derry route which makes for a pleasant and comfortable flight
667,aigle azur,7,aigle azur customer review,paris orly to lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes aigle azur worth considering cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a paid drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight the airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time dinner no food or snack service provided but not a loco as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry
13279,lan airlines,6,it was disappointing,santiago to sydney via auckland with latam airlines for now the largest airline in south america lan merged with tam to form latam it was disappointing from perspectives of cabin crew service attitude crew presence meal service and choice of liquors on particularly the longest leg 13 hrs sclakl aklsyd leg was slightly better crew the service crew behaviour was cold the cabin staff disappeared in the pantry for almost 20 minutes there was no premeal drinks service unless requested although biz class was only 70 full they seemed peeved by anyone ordering the standard full meal and breakfast vs an express option the main of veal and semolina arrived cold only a choice of one of each of whiskey rum vodka but the choice of argentinian or chilean wine was better noteworthy that it is one of the airlines longest routes on a b787 twinengine over the south pacific
8074,dragonair,9,smiles from cabin crew,wonderful flight and fantastic cabin crew we had just flown cathay pacific from adelaide to hong kong and then on going to beijing with dragonair brilliant service greeted with smiles from cabin crew very fast and caring about passenger safety comfort and top quality service very good food such as beef or fish or duck and all food presented piping hot and tasty great value in a clean fresh and well looked after aircraft well done dragonair we will fly again with you soon
16741,regional express,5,regional express customer review,sydney to orange return first experience with rex compared to some of the larger domestic and international carriers rex provided excellent service and warm friendly crew on both legs although only a 45 minute flight each way we were still provided with a snack and hot beverage baggage collection at sydney was outstandingly quick wed fly them again the checked baggage limit of 15 kg per person could provide a challenge for some people
17902,shanghai airlines,4,shanghai airlines customer review,gimpo seoul to shanghai return ground staff good flight attendants helpful even receiving a beer prior to takeoff first flight was gimposhanghai uncomfortable takeoff but after that no problems shanghaigimpo return no complaints good staff no entertainment but is a short flight good landing and on time no problems i would recommend this airline from a cost perspective but that would be all the best part was the 757 great aircraft
19340,sunwing airlines,2,this was not the most relaxing start to our vacation,indifferent management sours the experience that old saying about one bad apple spoiling the bushel really applies to sunwing the ground and flight crews were wonderful friendly helpful good sense of humour professionaltop notch the same holds true for the indestination reps and shuttle providers all very pro and we thank you very much the sour taste in my mouth comes from management or lack thereof i purchased my travel package online and paid for it in full at the time of booking 2 days before my departure i logged in to get my edocs and was informed by automated popup message that i had a balance owing on my invoice and that my trip could be cancelled if i didnt settle my account i immediately called sunwing customer service the service rep initially argued with me until i forwarded her my confirmation email from sunwing showing the balance paid in full yes i keep everything it took one hour and fourteen minutes on hold to resolve the discrepancy perhaps they were hoping i would simply give up and pay the difference of 140 this was not the most relaxing start to our vacation once i received written confirmation of the correction i thanked the rep for her help and asked to speak to a manager the manager was on lunch so i asked for a call back 5 hours later i had still not heard back so i emailed the original rep again 2 weeks later i have still heard nothing no explanation for the arbitrary price hike no offer of compensation for my inconvenience no apology for the reps initial antagonistic attitude or for my wasted time on hold while they corrected their own error nothing i promise to update this review if i ever hear back from sunwing i dont really expect to what a sad excuse for service
18263,singapore airlines,1,very friendly and attentive,the crew members were very friendly and attentive especially when my friend felt uncomfortable and vomited they provided considerate care which i am very appreciated
8424,edelweiss air,9,edelweiss air customer review,cphzrhpmizrh in c class very impressed with edelweiss in general nice clean aircraft and lovely and attentive crews from pmi we were lucky than edelweiss changed the aircraft to their brand new a330300 long haul aircraft i guess to familiarise crew with the new aircraft food was nice and well presented on all trips and all flights on time
9059,eurowings,7,isnt really a business class,checked in on eurowings app but had to go at check in desk as i had some questions regarding lounge priority lane etc the person at the business class counter was not aware of anything basically denied me lounge access eventually indicating me the wrong lounge and priority lane at the end i could enjoy the priority lane and had no problems getting into the right lounge by simply asking people working at the airport onboard incredibly nice flight attendant in the front of the cabin she really made a difference business class with eurowings isnt really a business class except lounge access and priority lanesboarding depending on the airport of departure while flying the perk is basically the seat next to yours is not occupied and you can choose from the onboard sales menu and get the items for free still all is in a paper cup and packed so dont expect a nice presentation on china of what you eat you just havent to pay for it as long you paid your business class fare
8357,edelweiss air,2,food is absolutely awful and totally substandard for business class,apart from the lie flat bed this is basically premium economy the food is absolutely awful and totally substandard for business class this is one of the main reasons i say it is more premium economy the tray is not at all business class small and cramped the plates not at all up to standard my main was a sausage can you believe this the accompaniment of hash browns were soggy because chef in his wisdom had them up against cabbagewhich of course is wet so a main of a sausage wet hash browns and cabbage i didnt eat this mess disgraceful my wifes salmon was swimming in oil and inedible the dessert might have been acceptable but it was tinyhardly a full spoonful the drinks selection is basic a two type wine selection for red and whiteno quality spiritsno dessert wine no cheese board for after the ife is dated with a very small selection the only thing that was good were the cabin crew excellent and i could see they were embarrassed regarding the food no this was beyond disappointing we were totally surprised at their business class we would not fly this airline again
14454,malaysia airlines,7,im a satisfied customer,smooth experience the flight is on time and proper boarding arrangements the meal was good the cabin crew performs at its best but ife need to be improve overall im a satisfied customer for this flight
3104,air zimbabwe,3,air zimbabwe customer review,living and working in south africa i fly home to zimbabwe fairly often and try to be patriotic and use the national airline i have only been delayed once in the past year food is good and service also of acceptable standards ggetting through to the joburg offices is another story altogether overall i think air zim are doing the best they can with the resources at their disposal
5985,breeze airways,2,disorganized terrible customer service,disorganized terrible customer service when something goes wrong i booked two one way flights with this airline since the routes were direct i upgraded to first class the first flight on the way there was a good experience with the exception of an initial delay that was less than 1 hour the seat in first class was comfortable and service on the flight was good things fell apart on the return flight the flight was delayed three times the gate was switched to the other end of the airport on the last delay issues occurred at the airport where the flight was removed from the status board for some reason however the breeze app listed the new gate but upon arrival to the gate there were no agents in uniform and the gate was advertised for a completely different airline after 15 min of searching for either a breeze representative there were none or someone working for the airport the flight was missed once i finally found a breeze representative they offered no realistic solutions the breeze agent claimed to have no responsibility for the monitor at the gate advertising a completely different flight with a different airline i was offered to be booked on a flight several days later to a different destination city that was more than a 6 hour drive from my original booking destination i was forced to book a new one way ticket from the airport costing close to 50000 just to get home breeze has made no offerings and seems to accept zero responsibility i highly encourage you to not book with this airline because if something happens good luck getting to your destination or back home i have always been a huge delta fan and would highly suggest sticking with a larger commercial airline where they value customer service and will take care to get you to your destination
14993,nepal airlines,6,nepal airlines customer review,new plane but limited legroom between seats flight departs right on time for 1hr 30 mins flight refreshing tissues full mealdrinks served quick and with efficiency cabin crew were mostly friendly but the options of meal given was veg or non veg which is not up to the standard of any national flag carrier the least they could do was mention the food being served
11237,iberia express,2,have my hand luggage checked,the worst company ever they forced me to have my hand luggage checked last moment because they lacked of space under the seats and once i arrived to my destination i had to wait at least 70 minutes to the stroller and hope i will get my luggage so i lost my airport bus to my city
16804,rex airlines,1,the best customer service,rex airlines is super warm and friendly felt treated like a vip staff helping you when you arrive at the airport you will be approached by a real human rather than a cold machine in melbourne on the 29 march the staff member was ready to help the best customer service checked my suitcase in for me and told me where to go every step of the way great for a first time traveller with rex very impressed cabin clean tidy and covid safe great experience with rex will travel with them again
1724,air france,7,i would fly air france again,the plane was nice ife was pretty good the main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag the staff in the plane from chicago to paris was not very friendly the staff in the way back from paris to chicago was very kind and helpful big difference lastly my checked bag didnt make it to chicago the staff at chicago didnt really want to help me one spent a few moments trying to register a claim gave up handed me a card with instructions and walked away i tried someone else about 15 minutes later while she was not happy to help she did complete the claim for me which i appreciated the bag was delivered to my door 200 miles from the airport the next day was was great i would fly air france again
9927,flysafair,4,disappointed by the professionalism by the flight attendants,my family and i are absolutely disappointed by the professionalism by the flight attendants we had an issue with another passenger with placing our luggage in the overhead bin and none of the attendants came to assist instead they saw it fit to just stare at us when it was our turn to disembark from the plane the flight attendant skipped our seat and proceeded to allow other passengers to leave the plane i did not appreciate the flight attendants tone when we ordered snacks she was not friendly the service was just appalling and disappointing
15213,norwegian,3,often delayed at least 1h,evening flights between krk and cph are often delayed at least 1h just because the plane did not make it on time from the previous route poor logistics of the company move the landing time of the delayed flights to eg 2 am which causes sleep deprivation of the traveller and greatly increases the cost of the trip as often the only option to get home at this hour is to take a taxi
21576,uzbekistan airways,3,uncomfortable sleepless night flight,we flew to tashkent on 11 october 2016 from london this was a night flight of 75 hours and we wanted to sleep but it was not to be this was an ancient plane whose business class seats reclined only a few degrees it was 2x2 seating did not taste the food as wanted to sleep tablets with pre loaded entertainment was offered i dont understand why such ancient planes are used on such a route they have boeing 787 but these are not thought to be worthy of this route the washrooms were sparsely equipped a very uncomfortable sleepless night flight
10249,garuda indonesia,5,service could have been much better,denpasar to sydney there is a big difference with garuda depending on the configuration of the aircraft unfortunately this flight was the old configuration and was not a true lie flat bed the ife on garuda is never great but this was as poor garuda also seem to struggle in business class when the flight is full i have to say that the service on this flight could have been much better on boarding there was no introduction by the fa we then had to wait for an hour to get a glass of wine off the crew and this was not replenished without asking as it was a late flight there was not dinner service and the breakfast was tasty but service was haphazard overall not the best experience in business class
12133,jet2com,8,very comfortable flight,stansted to antalya very comfortable flight food is very good and cabin crew were very friendly boarding started on time and our flight was on time however for a 34 hour flight there was no entertainment
2279,air mauritius,1,expected better treatment,london to mauritius in july 2017 myself my wife and 2 children aged 1 and 3 travelled to mauritius as a regular kestrel flyer i expected better treatment and better service they are very child unfriendly when we landed one of our luggage was missing this is despite the flight was the flight was delayed by more than one hour we landed on a sunday and had to attend a wedding the same night my wedding clothes and that of my wife were in that luggage i complained to the staff they could not care less and said i was not entitled to anything and was sent away no manager was available and later in turned out that the duty manager on the day was busy attending to the prime ministers wife in the state lounge and could not be bothered about paying passengers i complained to their customer service and the service i received was poor i wrote to the ceo and their chairman no response at all from them when we returned to the uk 2 weeks later two air mauritius staff were travelling they were being given business class treatment when they were travelling in economy in front of paying customers i spoke to the cabin crew about this and they could not care less what they offered me is 5000 travel points 50 euros and to use their lounge when i travel next which is pathetic to what my family went through travelling with them
3600,airbaltic,3,better use ryanair or wizz air,riga to dsseldorf got charged 60 extra because my backpack was a bit too heavy for hand luggage so i had to check it in as a normal bag it costs 60 no debate i will try to prevent flying with airbaltic in the future better use ryanair or wizz air they dont try to charge you 60 extra for backpack that is a bit too heavy
20995,tui airways,1,would happily fly with them again,after stupidly leaving our passports two hours away the tui staff at heraklion airport greece were extremely helpful thanks to them we made it on to the plane only to be greeted by a great duo who brought us lunch on board after hearing about our bad day wonderful experience of tui and would happily fly with them again
16845,rossiya airlines,8,rossiya airlines customer review,londonst petersburgnovosibirsk all flights on time cabin crew friendly and food pretty good and substantial all planes were oldish a319airbus but comfortable and clean i had to collect luggage and re checkin after each flight which was annoying and there was no inflight entertainment but these were really only minor downsides to a trouble free journey
13354,lan airlines,7,lan airlines customer review,fragru and grulhr flight departed on time nowadays there is not much differences between the main airlines and lan offered what is expected in economy class two full meals somewhat more basic than on main european carriers but portions a little larger good ife system and professional service from the staff less personal but on european carriers but nothing to complain about main complain was the hard narrow seats on boeing 777300er as in other carriers using the 3x4x4 option seats are much less comfortable than formerly and make longdistant flights something of a challenge but tam is not alone here
4610,asiana airlines,6,good amount of space,tokyo to seoul comfortable seat and good amount of space however needed to ask for drink before take off and was told that the champagne was frozen so that we could not have any got some eventually korean menu was good quality bimibap but wine selection was atrocious fas seemed to disappear and not very attentive was okay as a short 25 hour flight but expected better
21799,virgin america,3,a disappointing experience,flew virgin america from los angeles to sydney i have to say i was extremely disappointed with the food on both flights especially breakfast and yes i know we only flew economy class but the breakfast focaccia was so tough we would have been better off eating the box it came in the noise the cabin crew made on our flight home made it hard to sleep they werent helping customers they were just sitting talking amongst themselves about what theyd been up to in the last few days our seats were at the back of the plane picked on purpose and never before have i had to ask the staff to please quieten down so we could sleep all in all a disappointing experience
13200,kuwait airways,3,forgot my luggage in kuwait,new york to delhi via kuwait water bottle not provided in the flight so every time you want to drink water you have to call the flight attendant and she will bring a small glass of water for you flight delayed 15 hr and second time it delayed 12 hr they forgot my luggage in kuwait though it had a tag of delhi they are not picking my call vegetarian food is not available you have to give special order for vegetarian food mostly food was halal and pork free too much of crowd if you are travelling in economic class you have to be in a long queue for every checkin boarding blanket will be provided to those who ask for it it was wifi equipped but paid so i dont know how was the speed for entertainment it had decent number of nice movies movies in english islamic hindi but subtitles available only is arabic announcement were mainly in arabic and english
4135,alliance airlines,6,seem to be doing acceptable job,gladstone to brisbane i booked this flight through virgin australia website but later i found out that virgin ceased his service for some cities and gave it over to a new commercial airline called alliance airlines the aircraft was a fokker 70 with old interior look the legroom was very tight the airlines magazine was the only entertainment on board which hadnt been prepared tastefully on the positive side the crew were the most friendly cabin crew ive seen in australian airlines the complimentary snack it was a 730am flight was better than what virgin used to offer however the only drink available was water it is expected for an airline to offer coffee and tea in the morning at least they can sell a few options on board the flight time was shorter than usual as it wasnt a propeller aircraft handling at both airport was done by virgin australia so it wasnt really related to this review generally its good that a new competitor is entering the market as a beginner in this sector they seem to be doing acceptable job but they should improve some issues to become a rival to other airlines in regional australia
16983,royal brunei airlines,5,horrific experience,london to melbourne via brunei horrific experience travelling solo with a 15month old i understand that he does not pay so doesnt automatically get a seat he sat on my lap for the first 15 hours staff offered no support with helping me with bags to entertain him while i needed the toilet etc they didnt provide a meal for him when i asked they told me i should have specially requested one i asked for them to do this for the second leg of the trip they didnt when asked if they could provide some fruit i was told by one staff member we only give it out at snack times to the adult passengers the nappy change table is a weird oval shape and the babies legs hang over setting the sensors for the tap off its hard enough changing in limited space but the nappy change table meant some creative yoga poses the second leg the flight was half empty my child was once again on my lap i asked if i could move to the row in front so he could lay on the spare seat and we could both get some sleep i was told no that those seats you have to pay more for they were identical to the one i was sitting on i asked to speak to someone more senior who then agreed there is no way ill be flying with brunei again for the poor service the airport is horrific nothing to do basically no food to purchase other than chocolate and crisps go with someone else
8835,ethiopian airlines,3,pretty terrible for business class,staff are always nice on ethiopian and definitely the best part of the experience otherwise pretty terrible for business class the seats were old and dirty the entertainment system with limited selection food served to me was almost uniformly bad new business class lounge in addis airport is overcrowded hot and dirty the food is also pretty unappetizing and at breakfast they had no working coffee machine i fly this airline when i have no other choice
7398,condor airlines,2,most uncomfortable ive flown,economy was among the most uncomfortable ive flown in years im only 58 and there was barely enough legroom the temperature of the plane felt like 80 degrees for 11 hours the first meal was plain vegetable pasta and then the second was some sort of cheese sandwich with no alternative options they barely had enough ice if you wanted a cold drink when my mates and i wanted to order beers outside of the servicing period we were instructed to go to the back of the plane to ask and pay for it there lastly there were only two movies for in flight entertainment this is the kind of flight you want to bring your own meal and snacks on with your own entertainment setup i wont be flying them again
18222,singapore airlines,6,not as good i was expecting,i was looking forward very much to the experience on singapore airlines and even more so the a380 i was in the bulkhead seat in premium economy so the very first row on the lower level it was a nice smooth flight the ife was adequate but i was a little disappointed with the level of service ive always heard about how attentive the singapore girl ieflight attendants on sq were the service was far from the worst i have ever had on an airline but not as good as i anticipated maybe i was comparing it to the absolute best service i have ever had on an airline i flew on my last overseas flight a taipeibased airline dont get me wrong it was not bad at all just not as good i was expecting
3632,aircalin,3,absolute rubbish service,absolute rubbish service today at the start and the end check in line for economy was huge i had a qantas ticket codeshare and am platinum with qantas so attempted to use the premium queue which was not permitted despite not having clients premium checkin desks were not servicing economy clients preferring to chat amongst themselves flight was ok on arrival no carousel information and bags took over 30 mins to commence delivery a pa on were sorry for late delivery and miss communication really doesnt equate to being a reasonable service i wont fly air calin again
21818,virgin america,8,a very good airline,san francisco to los angeles this was an excellent flight on a very good airline i like virgin america with their modern simplistic approach with a focus on the things that matter and not others which cost money the plane was modern clean and streamlined with intimate lighting for an early evening flight from sfo to lax the service was friendly appreciating that at this time most of the passengers just want to relax i was very impressed with virgin america and will fly with them again
7158,citilink,8,flight attendants were very courteous and polite,pkubdo qg 982 using a320 registration pkgqq was planning to fly from pekanbaru to bandung with air asia but they stopped their service on that route and have to switch to citilink garuda indonesia junior citilink is a lowcost subsidiary of garuda and so during booking have to pay additional for seats and inflight meals but the price is still reasonable so was able to secure seats in the first row i was not hoping for much from a low cost carrier but the experience turned out to be quite good checkin was quick and with standard baggage allowance per person 20kg 44 at no additional cost airplane was brand new airbus 320 with leather seats flight attendants were very courteous and polite and they were also very helpful we paid for our meals but turns out for drinks we also have to pay extra on board and it is cash only restrooms were kept clean throughout the trip flight deck communication was adequate we were given informations on flight time and altitude before we take off and arrival time and bandung weather before we land delightfully surprised that their hard and soft products were better than expected for a low cost carrier and if they are as aggressive in their expansion they can give air asia a run for their money would use again if coming back to the area and recommended for people who wants a nofrills flight with good service quality
12945,korean air,2,they switched up on us at the last minute,i am traveling with 12 people and we have already reserved our seat we planned out who is sitting where on the plane because we have 3 little kids with us and we wanted to make sure they are comfortable on the 6 hours flight when did check again for our seat an hour before going to the airport and everything was the same but when we got to the airport during our luggage checkin they told use that our seats have been changed our group of 12 people were scattered around the airplane it was so difficult for my 3 and 5 year old to seat during the flight because we did not get the window seat that we reserved we did ask people to switch but they did not want to switch this is so horrible did not like how they switched up on us at the last minute
4588,asiana airlines,3,they forgot to serve my bread,the passenger experience has worsened beyond imagination even though i was being seated in business had little expectation for asianas product as their fleet is aging without much refurbishment but now it seems that the flight crew is losing it they forgot to serve my bread until the end of the meal in business class
13000,korean air,4,its so hard to book with them,seoul to bangkok generally staff at korean air are good food is pretty tasty and the onboard entertainment is varied but unfortunately gets interrupted all the time in 3 different languages strangely for a technologically advanced nation they fall down on their website and general technology their website in korea accepts korean or international cards if youre an expatriate your korean card wont work and if you use an international card youre likely to be singled out for fraud because quite rightly the credit card company wont share information with a vendor the process to overcome this is to type your entire credit card number into their system to unlock your booking the option not to do this is unavailable and no mention is made of what happens to this very private data once its been entered into their system additionally the company air miles system regularly doesnt recognise youve flown with korean air and the claims system makes absolutely no sense so id be surprised if i ever manage to claim its hard to give them a great rating when its so hard to book with them and theyre overpriced because the whole economy here is one big monopoly but ive increased my score because their staff are goods
17421,sa express,2,told to book another flight,bloemfontein to johannesburg the service i got at bloemfontein airport was horrible im not happy at all i arrive at the airport at 915 and they told me i cant check in for a flight that departs at 940 every time their flight gets delayed i dont complain but when i arrive at 915 i was told to book another flight
9362,fiji airways,8,service was friendly and efficient,sydney to los angeles with a stopover in nadi check in was easy with no waiting aircraft left a few minutes late due to normal sydney delays nadi is nearing a make over and no doubt the new lounge will be superior to the old one which is still usable flight from nadi left on time i slept most of the way to lax and the plane landed ahead of time food offered was of a good standard and the service was friendly and efficient the stop in nadi does break up the flight and the new look airport will be a big boost a good flight all over the ife is limited however there where decent choices
5308,bamboo airways,9,fas were all turkish women,hanoi to hue 5th january on an a320200 purchase online was easy and very clear without any hidden costs a minor reschedule was clearly informed and adjustable weeks before departure check in smooth though long queues despite 10 counters open had to wait 40 minutes to be checked in got offered seat and chose an exit seat as flight was only half full no issue with luggage like for other low cost carriers especially the vietjetair extremely strict luggage policies with several checks in airports onboard 4 fas and 2 service attendants for 80 passengers the fas were all turkish women while the sas were vietnamese and acted mainly as translators given water tissue magazines i brought my own coffee sachets to get expresso onboard 8 business class seats were empty flight on time bus gating in both ends extremely good value for money paid 33 usd attendant were very talkative and extrovert no ife on board but flight took only 70 minutes bamboo airways have their logos and branding everywhere onboard with nice decorations and new uniforms etc even the drinking water were produced labelled and marketed by the airline bamboo is considered as an lcc carrier but compares to a 3star legacy carrier a meal or at least a snack would have been nice but hard to claim for the price paid
16835,rossiya airlines,2,rossiya airlines customer review,fv245 ledfra 7913 fv246 fraled 14913 flew this airline last month to and from frankfurtmain on vacation the fare was quite high but i had connection with other family members in fra so had no choice the airbus a320 was okay satisfactory and clean the seat pitch well im 182m and it is rare that an aircraft is comfortable for me this one wasnt but its a common issue the flight itself was okay the flight crew were informative the cabin crew were terrible not a single smile unkind and impolite fellow passengers asked about the reasons for the delay and got a very rude answer inflight meal was awful as always cant review the ground staff since i had an internet checkin which took me half an hour to deal with the inbound flight was on time the return was 15 hours late transit passengers lost their connection flights the bottom line is that this is the worst not lowcost company i have flown with
14912,myanmar airways,7,myanmar airways customer review,i have flown myanmar airways several times in the last couple years i have found the service to be fine on the ground and in the air the flight which originates in singapore and flies through bangkok to yangon is exceedingly tight and uncomfortable however flights originating in yangon are comfortable and roomy in general prices are lower than for thai and bangkok air making it a good deal
22022,vistara,9,onboard experience is top notch,the checkin process was a downer the staff didnt seem enthusiastic for a business class desk this is doubly strange vistara is currently the finest full service airline in india and the onboard experience is top notch the seating is comfortable for shorthaul the service warm and the snacks served outstanding when is vistara going to start offering inflight wifi
8401,edelweiss air,2,ridicously tight seating,las vegas to zurich with edelweiss air ridicously tight seating in economy class made this one of my least relaxing longhaul flights ever being a relatively standard size 190 cm i was surprised to find that i simply couldnt sit normally without my knees touching or rather pressing hard into the seat in front of me when the passenger in the row in front of me reclined his seat i felt like a sardine with badly hurting knees sleeping was completely impossible and hadnt it been for the nice and friendly crew and the above average ife that helped kill the 10 hours i was wide awake it would have been my worst flight ever avoid this airline in economy class at all costs if youre taller than 165170 cm
9189,eva air,1,have not issued me a refund yet,on 03222020 eva air cancelled my flight from bangkok to seattle via taipei for 30th march on 03272020 i submitted the refund request form on their website and they have not issued me a refund yet i have tried calling every phone number i can find for them however they just ring and ring and ring some of the numbers have automated messages saying they have a high volume of calls right now and then hang up on you
20819,transaero airlines,6,transaero airlines customer review,ura to lhr return via dme checkin online fine personnel on baggage drop off both at ura and lhr staffed by bmi helpful and efficient planes are a bit on an older side but were okay and legroom in economy premium is good although seats were just what you expect from any regular yclass seat not premium at all dmelhr on 738 with airshow displaying the aircraft still in yellow tui livery b767300er on return from lhr okay leg room and they were showing a film but no headphones on offer food not bad but not too good either but fas are very efficient and friendly overall an average carrier which however takes you from a to b safely and on time i would recommend this carrier for good fares and will use them again
5353,bangkok airways,8,once again a great flight,vientiane to bangkok once again a great flight left on time and smooth all the way food was good quality but not to my taste only issue is they have premium priority and privilege customers which does lead to confusion
12479,jetstar asia,2,only airline im dissatisfied with,singapore to darwin ive been traveling consistently for more than six months now and jetstar is the first and only airline im dissatisfied with it takes a lot for me to get motivated to write an online review but here we are i booked a flight online in october for dec 2 then later tried to move my departure to the previous day the payment system would not take my edit and payment and would clear all my credit card input and return me to an empty payment screen i tried a few times and then gave up i found out later this was due to a browser incompatibility issue they have yet to address pro tip use safari not chrome anyway when i arrived at the airport last night to check in i was informed that my flight left a day earlier when i insisted that was incorrect the staff while cordial basically told me it was my problem because i had definitely made the change online paid the change fee and received a confirmation to be fair that much is true but how this played out is really bothersome to me what essentially happened was a booking glitch in the companys ui where i was led to believe that my change was ineffective when in fact it went through after checking i did apparently receive a confirmation email buried way back in an inbox i can seem to only access with some creative filtering and any kind of extra surcharge for moving would involve me scrutinizing my bank account online daily something thats simply not realistic for me to do regularly due to my constant travel schedule so now im out the cost of that flight the cost of an emergency hotel and the cost of another much more expensive flight my weekend is pretty much ruined and much of the next week will be in a rush because i dont have the weekend to regroup ive contacted the help live chat with this company and i still get the its your problem you made the changes line ive tried contacting them via social media channels and they are only staffed by chatbots i would love some kind of compensatory gesture an apology at the very least but some help with these emergency expenses due to the companys transactional obfuscation online would be better poor experience all around i will not be doing any further booking with jetstar
16322,primera air,9,was great value for money,newark to paris as a result of the delays in receiving their a321lr aircraft premera air contracted euroatlantic to fly the newark pariscdg routethe check in took about 45 mins as it was a full flight it took about 40 mins to get through security at newark due to the lack of tsa staff and screening equipmentthe seats were comfortable ahd a personal tv screen in each seat which had a limited selection of films and tv shows there was also a usb port to charge personal devices there were no headphones offered on board luckily we had our own set the scheduled flight time was 6 hrs 25 mins we took off about 30 mins late but we managed to arrive on time into cdg the euroatlantic staff were friendly and attentive and looked after the passengers on the flight meals and drinks were provided to those passengers who booked their meals through the primera air website overall this flight was great value for money

7007,china eastern airlines,8,pleasantly surprised,beijing to yinchuan heard mixed reviews of china eastern airlines but was pleasantly surprised comfortable seats with ample legroom plane was new and looked brilliant in the silver skyteam livery food was decent although i noticed that they dont offer a drink selection and only give passengers a bottle of water in terms of ife you cant expect much when flying within china except a movie or show being shown on the overhead monitors i was asleep for most of the flight and was pleased with how smooth the ride was all in all a good experience
15133,nok air,4,the crew didnt look happy,my first time with nok air from bangkok to phuket the flight took off and landed on time legroom was fine my seat was dirty and not cleaned from the previous flight the food they hand out isnt special but i didnt expect anything for a one hour flight so i cant complain the crew didnt look happy and were unfriendly something i havent experienced before on a thai airline i couldnt understand what they said during the announcements it seemed like even they werent very eager to be on that flight it was my first and probably last experience on this airline
6679,cayman airways,1,dont fly cayman airways,dont fly cayman airways 12 hour delay communicated to us every few hours because the flight crew had to rest been in the airport 12 hours now with no reliable takeoff time and no offer of compensation for a full day missed of vacation the customer service is atrocious upon further research i have learned that this is a normal course of business for this airline they do not honor their flight times and fly upon the crews whims save yourself the aggravation and fly jetblue instead

17401,s7 siberia airlines,5,s7 siberia airlines customer review,beijing to irkutsk and from to moscow apart from problems with visas the airport service was good service on the plane was appalling for almost 7 hours on the plane we didnt notice single smile on staff faces rude and not very helpful like they work there as a punishment portions of food was ridiculous and boxes like happy meal at mcdonalds we had also a lots of problems to book tickets on internet being in irkutsk at the airport system didnt accept our cards even if we tried like 6 of different kind they lost my luggage in beijing but luckily was sent to london a week later

40,adria airways,6,service of a low cost airline,adria airways has the price of a regular airline but the service of a low cost airline all the beverages and food are for purchase the seats are fine staff is friendly since we usually travel very early in the morning or very late in the evening we use the flight to rest every time we ask for a pillow we get one it might sound strange but this is very important for us
8032,delta air lines,4,the second bag is still in naples,my wife and i were returning from a long delayed vacation we splurged on first class flights our flight was supposed to leave naples italy at 0610 air france sent a heavy aircraft to naples that had problems getting back out as a result we missed our connecting flight in paris also an air france flight by about 15 minutes we were rebooked on a delta flight 5 hours later when we arrived in atlanta on delta flight 085 our checked bags were not on it we contacted baggage services and they told us the bags were in paris and would be put on a flight the next day and we would have them by 9 pm we made it clear that the bags contained prescription medication that we needed the next day neither bag showed up despite repeated attempts to track them using deltas online system at 915 pm we were told that the bags would be coming in the next day today at 1000 today we found one bag loaded onto an alitalia flight from naples they never made it to paris to begin with and that it would be transferred to a flight to atlanta today the second bag is still in naples and no one at delta can do anything to get it moving they pass it off as the baggage handlers problem not deltas
15644,openskies,2,will not be traveling openskies again,paris ory to new york jfk with openskies i utilized my american airlines frequent flyer miles and i will not waste them on this airline again the seat configuration was so bizarre i had a window seat and i had to climb over the seat next to me to get into the aisle as it was configured in the opposite direction from mine one expects business class to have a seat that lies down flat after all thats why i chose to fly this class on a flight over the atlantic it was not in the least bit comfortable and i cant imagine who thought it would be going forward i will not be traveling openskies again
10721,gulf air,8,has improved a lot,london to lahore via bahrain i have been a frequent flyer on gulf air and was assigned front seats on both travel legs gulf air has improved a lot but a few things need some improvement the drink service is too late as i finished my main meal without any drink and they gave the drinks when all passengers were being served the main meal which i felt was not helpful secondly the ife lacked variety and had limited choice transit was smooth however they changed the aircraft at the last minute and as i result half of my luggage came in the next flight which was in the evening i had to travel 4 hours from my home the next day to collect it from airport which was really annoying the good on bahlhe leg needs a lot of improvement and again the drinks were served long after i finished my meal
15215,norwegian,1,was disappointed with everything,ble skuffet med alt fra nettside og ansatte p flyplass osv ville kjpe cabinbagasje og prvde gjre det bde p nettet og via appen uten hell mtte betale mye ekstra p flyplssen for en liten bagasje som ikke veide mere enn 7 kg was disappointed with everything from website and airport staff etc wanted to buy cabin luggage and tried to do it both online and via the app with no luck had to pay a lot extra at the airport for a small piece of luggage that weighed no more than 7 kg
8031,delta air lines,1,little better than a long domestic flight,i do not recommend this route when i purchased the ticket delta was partnered with air france i fly this route often and when operated by air france it was a much better experience deltas lax to paris now uses a domestic terminal with no access to duty free or the good airport lounges we had to use the delta one lounge which was the mcdonalds of airport lounges when we boarded the plane they did not offer champagne they had sparkling wine the business class cabin was mediocre and the the goody bag was kitch environmental rubbish i enjoy flying international because usually it is luxurious and a highlight of the trip this was a little better than a long domestic flight which is sad wont make this mistake again dont fly delta international out of lax delta stay in your lane and keep to domestic flights sub out your international flights to companies that remember what service and class was
22976,xiamen airlines,9,recommend for the budgetwary traveller,amsterdam to taipei via xiamen with xiamen airlines after reading many reviews here about the transfer service in xiamen i was a bit worried but it turned out ok yes you still need to check yourself and your baggage in at xiamen again but ground staff seem to be used to the procedure by now in amsterdam and in taipei they understood they could only tag our bags to xiamen in xiamen when arriving at customs its best to have printed proof youre transferring but they have a list of transferring passengers theres a counter for free hotel if your wait is longer than 6 hours dont confuse this counter with the transfer service counter thats right next to it thats only for domestic transfers i mistakingly waited in that line for some time the hotel is 20 minutes by taxi but its nice one awkward thing is that they put 2 solo passengers into one room luckily i didnt have any roommate on the long flight both ways they ran out of coconut juice halfway on xiamen to taipei they gave drinks only after the food so you had to eat either thirsty or with cold food on taipei to xiamen they didnt give any drinks at all but maybe that was because i had ordered a special meal when booking china has some strict rules about mobile phones and power banks on the site it says you can do online checkin if you fly from amsterdam but i got an error when i tried maybe that only works if youre not transferring all in all its very cheap and the annoyances are not dealbreakers if youre prepared for them so i recommend it for the budgetwary traveller
21529,us airways,2,us airways customer review,we recently travelled via us airways to st lucia virgin islands our return flight home was routed through charlotte nc here we were scheduled for a 3 hour layover plenty of time to get through customs and immigration and recheck our baggage for our final destination however the plane was one hour late in boarding in st lucia upon our arrival in charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our deplaning once at the gate we were told that customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane at this point we had 1 hour left to get through customs and immigration recheck our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take off my husband had tsa precheck on his ticket however i did not i had to go through a very long security line my husband went to the gate to notify our plane that i was on my way hurrying just as i finally ran to the gate just at the 15 minute before flight mark the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board i begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge we went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day so with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage we were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline by the way our flight from st lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left we had not eaten all day
7490,copa airlines,1,unconcerned about their service,i am a frequent traveler but i have never dealt with an airline as frustrating as this one at the start of my flight i had to surrender my carry on and i never saw it again i filed a lost baggage claim in manaus and i did not even receive a copy of the claim the agent told me to photograph the report which was hand written three passengers on the half filled flight lost luggage including some expensive fishing equipment when i arrived in panama city for my layover the baggage wasnt there and employees brushed me off for two hours since the loss of the bag i have sent two emails to copa and i phoned them today the emails have been unanswered and the call was futile i was simply told to send another email for them to ignore this airline is staffed by incompetent people who are totally unconcerned about their service

20037,thai airways,4,pretty disappointed with the service,we travelled thai airways from melbourne to chennai via bangkok and vice versa we are still not sure on the process to book the bassinet seat and on based on what priority it can be booked we are travelling with a 9 month old and we will have to sit with infant through out the flight i know few airlines which provide bassinet for babies until 1 year old we checked with customer care on the process to book the front row seat with leg space during our flight to bangkok and they advised us to speak at the counter at the counter they say the flight is full and asked us call and book before the flight we somehow managed travelling to bangkok which is a 9 hour flight with baby in our lap we had some trouble when people in front of us push their seat back on our return flight we checked with them please note we consistently called them no response mailed them no response we rang them again and the officer said she cannot book online and we call them some hours before we did call and still we didnt get the seat the lady in the counter said we should call and talk end of story we didnt get seat and no staff is able to direct us on the process to book this seat in thai airways only infants below 6 months can avail the facility of bassinet i am not sure i saw babies or parents with babies in that seat in some place they say if we pay we can get the seat we are pretty disappointed with the service and expect parents with babies or toddlers under 2 years get some preferences with regards to seat
1650,air europa,7,decent flight crew service,first timer here with this airline quite inline to my expectations meaning they are part of an air alliance so they should be holding to a minimum service standard overall it was ok the best aspects of my flights experience part of skyteam so my luggage transfer from klm was easy and seamless we flew with the boeing 787 so it was nice and new decent flight crew service the areas where ae can improve their company site can be more user friendly as i had a bit of trouble trying to manage my booking prior to my departure seat selection is also not complimentary for everyone during web check in inflight entertainment has limited new movies not bad overall but i just wish they can offer free seats 48 hr before departure
6530,cathay dragon,5,very poor service,hong kong to hangzhou very poor service with no clear explanation for flight delay this airline always delays one flight with fewer customers in order not to delay other flights with more customers for example the flight from hong kong to hangzhou flight number ka622 is frequently delayed for 34 hours due to airlines poor operations of flight schedules but not because of weather conditions
979,air bagan,8,air bagan customer review,chiang mai to yangon return and pleasantly surprised by the standard fairly new aircraft and meal service for 50 minute flight flight attendants were somewhat offhand reasonable leg room in economy
16961,royal brunei airlines,7,unpleasant checkin experience,unpleasant checkin experience which really spoiled the overall experience more than anything else first of all online checkin failed repeatedly and no help was forthcoming from the email address that the airlines website faqs directed questions on online check in errors to to this day i have never received a response to my email their online checkin system seems to be fundamentally broken since resumption of operations post covid therefore i went early to the airport 3 hours ahead of the scheduled flight time for manual checkin but found a long poorlymanaged queue the ground staff to whom royal brunei have subcontracted ground operations at heathrow terminal 4 were surly and disinterested the particular lady who handled our check in was rude asked the same question 3 times because she wasnt paying attention to our answers or to her job and was instead casually complaining to her colleague about not wanting to work overtime right in front of us rather than just getting on with the task at hand its very unprofessional to discuss work gripes in front of customers whom one is supposed to be attending to at that moment priority boarding for reserved seating was honoured though you have to listen carefully for the rushed announcements or youll miss the very short window given for priority boarding additional leg space for the reserved seating was good making the journey more comfortable the flight took off almost two hours late though the exact reason for this wasnt made clear to passengers and we had to wait on board during the delay cabin crew were very polite and helpful though overall the standard of service on royal brunei has declined compared to a decade ago eg no amenity kits were provided for this flight and only one meal was served on a seven and a half hour flight lhr to dxb it was tasty but the portion size was on the small side free snacks were available at the rear galley for those who went to get them but the cabin crew almost never came round with drinks except once with the meal service however they did always respond attentively to calls and were friendly and efficient the condition of the aircraft is very good complimentary toothbrushes were provided in the washrooms blankets and pillows provided for all seats the entertainment system had a wide variety of options though some were quite obscure and the system is not easy to navigate or search through headphones were not distributed from london and i had to ask for them they didnt actually carry enough headphones for all passengers on this flight which is shocking quality of the sound from the airlinesupplied headphones was poor
5576,berjaya air,9,berjaya air customer review,sinrdn return a new atr72 with two flight attendants for a 15 hr flight a packed towel plus a bottle of water was given out although the attendants werent very enthusiastic the crew members in the flight deck kept us up to date with information

22466,volotea,7,better than ryanair,in general volotea is a good airline every time ive flown with them everything has been correct no delays planes are comfortable and somewhat clean crew is generally polite and nice however there are downsides as in customer service this last time ive flown with them i checked in my luggage at the counter and it arrived with a bit of the zip open no one would actually give me a coherent answer to my claim i was left in the hands of automatic responses etc another time having purchased my seat i was asked to change it because they or their algorithm had seated separately a mother and a toddler i said i wouldnt change it before boarding as i had paid to my surprise a flight attendant confronted me once again onboard when all passengers had already been sat that is plain rude and once again never got a proper answer after having filled in a complaints form to sum up volotea is better than ryanair but they still need to improve many things will keep flying with them though
11162,iberia,6,honors its contract with passengers,overall the airline honors its contract with the passengers the seats are not comfortable and space and room falls short of expectations flight attendants do the necessary to accommodate passenger needs but they will not go out of their way to help you more that the square in which they are trained food is decent hydration also movie menu is good they keep to their schedule
11947,jeju air,3,very disappointing service,very disappointing service especially at its home base icn checked in online the day before departure and still arrived at the airport 2 hours before departure which would be before 6am and found out that there was basically no benefit at all for the extra effort the previous day i still had to go through the endless wait the queue was so long that it completely filled up the massive checkin area at icn and still seeped out into the corridor area one might wonder that the queue was probably because some of the machines were out of order but no the queue was really just to drop checked luggage via superslow machines in short the airline was basically not allowing any nonpremium customers to be served by humans just by selfcheckin kiosks for those lazy customers who dared not check in online the day before departure and by selfbag drop machines which were absolutely lacking in number and seemed to confuse the customers all the time what happened after the stressful bag drop simple the flight was delayed by 20 minutes which snowballed into an overall delay of 40 minutes when i finally landed in fuk considering that icnfuk is supposed to take 80 minutes from gate to gate this delay is horrible i ended up almost missing my selfarranged connecting domestic flight despite a generous selfsecured transit time of 25 hours thanks to the massive delay caused by jeju air paid 300 just for a short roundtrip ticket between icn and fuk completed online checkin the day before and still arrived at the airport 2 hours only to find out that checking in luggage is something to be punished at jeju air by an endless queue and had to wait in line for 30 minutes just to drop my pithy bag then found out that the flight was going to be hugely delayed and almost missed my domestic connection 25 hours apart jeju air only offers 15 kg as your base checked luggage allowance you have to purchase its flybag tier ticket to get any checked luggage allowance and even after that it is still only 15 kg even peach the supercheap lcc in japan offers 20 kg all the other services were just as expected mediocre seat pitch and comfort even according to lowcost airline standards okay cabin service not that they were bad but they were not that great either limited food beverage options and no inflight entertainment and cabin connectivity given the short flight distance however i guess the nonexistence of any inflight digital stuff should not be negatively judged upon jeju air
14552,malindo air,2,worse airline ive experienced,kota kinabalu to kuala lumpur this is the worse airline ive experienced i wanted to changecancel my flight called the service centre but it seems she was no help she made matter more confusing and she gave me the wrong info but to make matter worse i got my luggage damage try to file a complain but they said i got no insurance so nothing cant be done i understand that part but i had to travel far back and forth to the lost and found department holding my heavy luggage without any offer to help me carry them
19720,tam airlines,6,tam airlines customer review,flew mvdsao c class and then lh 1st class to fra and tlv due to a mess af made when arriving and departing late from mvd and thus not allowing me to check bags to tlv i had to reroute my ticket on the spot through my travel agent and must say that tam special service agents and staff are always fabulous ground staff were smiley putting me at ease as usual and checking me through no problems at all unlike af dont care attitude since tam became lantam not so good but the spirit of pax first is there flight mvd to sao fine on board and i was then looked after by lh 1st class team on arrival in sao i think tam is great both on the ground and on board shame they will discontinue first class but bravo again will recommend
16610,qatar airways,4,ignored my complaint,the flight from bne to doh in november 2022 was very pleasant in qsuite and with an amazing staff and great food i was very happy the flight from doh to zrh on the other hand was on a very old plane and staff didnt seem motivated my virgin australia flight from mel to bne got cancelled and qatar did give me the choice to go without that leg or cancel the entire flight i had to organise the rebooking myself and they kept sending me emails about cancelled flights which every time i had to investigate to find out that there were no cancellations the customer service of qatar ignored my complaint and did not respond
13489,lao airlines,5,lao skyway customer review,bkkvte very clean cabin and good service very friendly and helpful staff departure and arrival on time
18035,silkair,4,silkair is really very ordinary,cochin to singapore the positive is that we left and arrived in good time however the price does not justify what you actually get premium price very old plane with no personal screens note you can download their app to watch a variety the food was dreadful served at something like midnight i opened the foil and recoiled it was that bad fortunately i kept dropping off to sleep which helped the flight pass faster overall if i was choosing this route in future i would just go with the cheapest option as silkair is really very ordinary
16771,rex airlines,3,in melbourne was utterly unhelpful,rex staff at melbourne airport were appalling when i visited them to check in the day before my flight the lady who attended to me first in melbourne was utterly unhelpful her colleague seemed to realise that i was being misadvised and so the other rex person stepped in and completed what was required to be done on the day of my flight i needed help re carrying my bigger bag next time i will make sure i have a bag with wheels but the rex personnel said that they could not help me with that until i had been through the check in area yet adelaide staff in rex did help when i was in adelaide earlier i use an aid to walk and i am elderly and i was flying solo rex staff at airport were negative when i asked if a trolley or something after i had gone through checkin to help me to carry the bag i asked if that was possible and i got no where i did not know where to go to wait for the plane and was told i should go back where i came from to the rex staff so different to the rex staff in adelaide after letting a man in the area where one goes through the xray that i did not know how far the walk was nor where to go he was completely disinterested if i started walking and chose the wrong way i was worried i might miss the plane he utterly disinterested told me if you miss your plane you can try to get a refund i felt worried and distressed eventually another person did help me and it was a long walk much longer than i anticipated to the correct area i thanked that person who was not a rex employee i had told the rex staff the day before that i thought i would need some assistance re getting to the plane yet was that request not documented because on the flight day they blamed me for not having asked earlier for assistance i clearly did say the day before that i would require assistance the rex staff at melbourne were not kind not interested not understanding and not reassuring only at the final moment just before boarding and just before she finished her shift for the day did a very nice rex lady come over to me and she advised that she had arranged some help for me that was good buut when i arrived in adelaide no one on the plane had arranged for me to get help with getting my heavier bag out to the taxi as no one had been asked to arrange that fortunately another person one of the air hostesses on the plane stepped in and suggested i wait until the other passengers had left the plane and then she would get me a person to help i appreciated her understanding i cannot understand why for the same airline that staff in one city can be pleasant and helpful while their colleagues in another city could not care less
22325,volaris,2,avoid at all cost,horrible flight i got a cancelled flight during thanksgiving okay thats fine i didnt get compensated but i can handle it then in february my flight got delayed by 5 hours late at night 10pm flight turns to a 230am flight how do they repay us giving us a 150 pesos 7 usd to wings a very overpriced food place food is like 210 and they charge us ridiculous overpriced food it took them one hour to even get our order 30 minutes to give us the food and another hour to get the check actually we were tired of waiting and when we were about to walk out is when they wanted to suddenly serve us we have to pay an extra 188 pesos because the food is way more than the 150 voucher after that horrible restaurant experience we are still waiting for our flight avoid at all cost
16373,qantas airways,2,disgraceful and filthy travel experience,sydney to christchurch on 20th april 2023 and never have i experienced such a disgraceful and filthy travel experience as that which i along with other passengers were forced to endure during this flight flight qf137 delayed for over 1 hour flight entertainment not working throughout the journey blood or food on seatbelt clip chewing gum on back of seat second rate substandard food simply disgusting recline button on seat not working dirty floor worn and stained seat temperature control not working stuck on cold which made it uncomfortable for the entire flight dirty tray table grubby and dirty magazine luggage left in the rain on the tarmac in sydney during the delayed flight resulting most of my cloths being wet once they were retrieved in christchurch this is an international flight albeit only from sydney to christchurch this is not only reflected in the fare but the additional time required to transit through customs and security etc as a passenger i will think carefully before i choose to fly qantas again as i know that you can do better finally it saddens me to see how the high standard of service and quality that qantas was known for has been eroded to below that of ryan air clearly the plane had not been cleaned properly in a quite sometime and should never have been used for an international flight or for any flight for that matter under the qantas brand
6338,buta airways,8,everything went smoothly here,tbilisi to baku everything went smoothly here boarding was quick and on time we were pushed back on time which also meant the flight left on time it was only a short hop of 55mins i will see how they are again when i fly 3 hours plus on my next flight overall no issues airline very smooth and would recommend
21303,uganda airlines,9,a really pleasant experience,flying with uganda airlines was a really pleasant experience the bombardier crj900 was more than adequate for the task of flying from dar es salaam tanzaniato entebbe uganda and back the aircraft was perfectly clean in both flights and the cabin crew quite professional and kind i especially appreciated the leg space available far better than on most european economy class seats experienced a snack was served during the 150 minutes flight that included a chicken sandwich a fruit juice a small bottle of water and a banana more than enough for a mid afternoon flight worth mentioning is the kind support that i received at uganda airlines office in entebbe when facing an administrative issue that could have badly affected my trip very effective personnel who did more for me than it was their duty thumbs up
1434,air china,7,by far the cheapest option,singapore to new york via beijing in economy total fare was sgd 847 by far the cheapest option at the time of booking the sinpek flight i had selected was cancelled more than a month before the trip with an earlier and later flight offered all flights departed and arrived on time the legroom and pitch were acceptable and the adjustable head and calfrests were much appreciated the level of cleanliness was generally good with cleaning of the lavatories by the cabin crew a decent selection of english content available in the ife system though the touchscreen was insensitive and the audio jacks and headphones had to be cajoled into producing even tinny monaural sound my preordered vegetarian meal was not loaded onto the sinpek flight due to the schedule change but the avml and vlml meals on the other sectors were satisfactory each featured a small and rather underwhelming entre along with a rotating ensemble of sides including hagendazs ice cream and upstate farms yogurt on the ewrpek sector a selection of soft drinks and chinese wine and beer were offered during regular drink runs the onboard service was polite and efficient one issue was that the layovers were extremely long however air china offers economy passengers with long layovers free transit lounge access though the contracted bcat lounge was basic it proved very useful on the return leg in summary air china offered extremely affordable and reasonably comfortable transportation
9303,fiji airways,1,totally soured my hope to get to fiji one day,due to covid my flight was cancelled well they kept putting me on a flight for a month in the future like i can change work plans to travel any time and all the while covid is happening i had to call to cancel they offered credit no i want a refund they had to get approval to refund and against all odds the lady called back to say a refund had been initiated this is may 2020 30 days later with no refund i call and they say it is taking 60 days to refund beyond me as alaska air refunded in 48 hours in 60 days i call said refunds taking 90 days as they have so many refunds it cant be the mechanics of the refund because how hard is that they must be broke today after over 100 days of waiting i called the lady says it is taking 90 days i said it is well past 90 days she says i will work to get your refund within a week i called my credit card company and expect resolution only because of my credit card company totally soured my hope to get to fiji one day i wonder if they will make it through covid i wont ever be flying with them if i can help it
9641,flair airlines,1,2 hours without someone answering,this is a scam a bunch of crooks they gave me a rebooked flight and didnt even ask me if i am willing to take it called customer service and waited for 2 hours without someone answering my call at all i paid for another flight and they still ask me to pay for a carry on bag im never gonna take this airline ever again
1821,air india,2,cabin crew not arrived,we at 645 am are still waiting for the cabin crew to arrive for the flight which was supposed to board by 510 am the cabin crew not arrived yet this has caused a suffering to so many passengers all of us are stuck because of the captain and his crew members can the air india never improve
18273,singapore airlines,7,excellent plane great service,london to singapore a350 excellent plane great service fantastic ife terrible food and small portions i managed to sleep for half of the flight singapore to manila on boeing 787 an excellent plane great service on this short overnight flight fantastic ife food was better than previous flight but still not great singapore airlines meals arent as good as they used to be
950,air austral,9,air austral customer review,nourunmrs return the overall service and meals were beyond expectations for a french airline crews were polite professional and present throughout the cabin all flights with brand new b773 are pleasant with ptvs and conformable seats the only flight with b772 was on the mrsrun leg and it was a shame because no ptv on this ageing aircraft however the transit area in saint denis la runion airport definitely needs to be revamped there is nothing air austral can do about it but i hope this will be modernised shortly
9172,eva air,5,a horrible flight for me,taipei to san francisco my flight was on august 18 2022 on br 18 from taipei to san francisco i have a condition called oab over active bladder and thats why i always wanted to sit near the lavatory because i always have to empty my bladder every 30 mins on that flight i was on 73h last row aisle sit right side and behind me was the lavatory since i got into the plane i rushed to the lavatory behind my seat and it was occupied i waited for 15 mins and a flight crew approached me and told me to just use the lavatory on the other side and that was fine with me since it was vacant but mid flight i noticed every time i went to that lavatory it was always occupied and i was forced to use the left side lavatory or on the lavatory on the middle part of the plane but one time i caught a flight crew came out on that lavatory behind me and as soon as she came out she suddenly locked the lavatory from outside and make it appear that it was occupied but nobody was using it and the reason they are locking it from outside so that nobody can use that lavatory except for them crew it was a horrible flight for me because i badly need to use a lavatory to empty my bladder i have one behind me but that crew on that flight are using it exclusively so i have to use the other side but it always had a long line or the lavatory on the middle part of the plane which is too far from my seat
9720,flyarystan,3,treated rudely at check in,almaty to shimkent was treated rudely at check in the first time we flew it was very cheap and this time we flew it was almost the same price as air astana on one flight we had to wait taras to almaty three hours because they lost a passenger and even get off and go back on the plane
15512,oman air,4,bags a week after my arrival,melbourne to tehran via muscatabu dhabi i received my bags a week after my arrival in tehran because they engaged another airline etihad to do the first part of the journey my bags were held in abu dhabi the staff in tehran were rude and unhelpful trying to avoid accepting the responsibility i think this company is far from being an international professional airline they are known for missing bags the second issue was the extremely expensive cost of rebooking a flight once you miss one flight it cost me 1300 australian dollars to rebook my flight from abu dhabi to melbourne
19884,tap portugal,7,experiences werent bad at all,booked my flight during the pandemic and rescheduled twice endless calls with taps contact centre contact members giving contradicting advice on flight options some employees would be very calm and patient others would simply cut the line this part was horrible i spend hours calling them we took our flights with a 6month baby and used the bassinet we had our doubts beforehand but were positively surprised staff was very friendly and helpful aircraft clean and well maintained layover in lisbon straightforward lisbonamsterdam was a full flight so space was limited unfortunately wanted to share this experience because tap has such a bad rating i have flown tap before to brazil and must confess that both my experiences werent bad at all contact centre must be improved though
8371,edelweiss air,5,was actually not bad,zurich to newark staff was very friendly and the food was not bad the drinks were frequent and alcohol included which was great there were customers who smelled as though they had not showered in days they were up and moving all flight several passengers yelled at them as the airline attendants did not address their lack of concern for other passengers had it not been for these people the flight would not have been bad for a 9 hour flight the airline was actually not bad all things considered
12125,jet2com,6,jet2 is perfectly decent,leeds bradford to thessaloniki for the most part this airline is fine both the outbound and return flights took off an hour late not the longest of delays but a bit annoying the pilots made up a chunk of time on the return and we arrived only 25 mins after the scheduled time i guess the swift turnaround helped to explain the lack of cleaning always a bit disconcerting to open ones tray table to find the spill marks of a previous passengers drink see pic same plane for both journeys a 27 yearold 737300 however it had been retrofitted including winglets and the interior looked very new apart from it being a little noisy the planes age was no issue the seats were interesting plastic with minimal cushioning see pic they didnt lean back a good thing and had tiny armrests a bad thing i suppose it allows the airline to fit more in without reducing legroom they were comfy enough for the first couple of hours but as we approached the third hour the lack of cushioning started to tell the plastic felt sticky avoid wearing shorts the legroom was perfectly fine for short haul this is the first flight ive taken on which there were no window blinds or dimmers a real curiosity and i cant think why they would be absent it made the outbound journey uncomfortable until i fashioned a blind of my own using a sweatshirt until then the sun was pretty blinding and hot as a budget product jet2 is perfectly decent booking easy online checkin and printing of boarding passes easy no ife but none was expected didnt bother ordering food but the menu items were predictably overpriced didnt pay for checkedin baggage as the 10kg allowance for hand luggage was enough for my short trip well done for this in particular jet2 the staff were fine efficient and friendly enough without being overbearing i felt a bit sorry for them to be honest having to spend much of their time trying to sell stuff i guess its the necessary economy of the budget airline i didnt like the fact that they prohibited the drinking of ones own alcoholic beverages and only allowed us to consume those bought on board i appreciate theres a security aspect being able to refuse extra drinks to very drunk people but i suspect theres a profitbased motivation too naturally when the crew announced you shouldnt drink your own alcoholic drinks i understood it as you shouldnt get caught drinking your own alcoholic drinks i was very discreet
17115,royal jordanian airlines,2,staff at checkin would not let him board,my son and i took pcr tests on thursday afternoon for a saturday flight to dubai from chicago his negative pcr result lacked a time of day mine did not the rj staff at checkin would not let him board despite the fact that this test would have been within 72 hours no matter what time the test was taken on thursday we were offered no compensation nor any explanation where the rj or uae rules require a time of day stamp on the pcr test he was unable to come and we lost a few thousand dollars in a series of flights and other ticketed activities
6653,cathay pacific airways,1,not waive the cancellation fee,perth to osaka via hong kong due to corona virus many airlines are cancelling flights to hong kong and waiving cancellation and rebooking fees cathay pacific however will not waive the cancellation fee they are essentially forcing me to fly through hong kong on my way to and from japan risking my health and putting me in a position where i might not be let back into australia if i choose to cancel i have to pay 500 in cancellation fees its an absolute joke cathay pacific is a hong kong based company and this is where most of their business is they are risking peoples health and livelihood by not waiving these cancellation fees who can afford to just waste 500 for nothing i phoned several different representatives to explain my situation they are all drones who repeat the same thing and when i eventually got put through to a manager i was on hold for an hour before they disconnected the call they are waiving the rebooking fees however which almost makes it worse they are admitting there is a problem but then not allowing people to cancel their flights i cannot rebook my flight as there are no available flights which get me to where i need to go without travelling through hong kong whoever has made this decision is thinking about their business only and not the safety and well being of their customers
10833,hainan airlines,9,professional service standard,haikou to sydney this service on this flight is outstanding cabin manager is friendly professional and she provides help at the first time when i have a request the hai chef provided me with excellent meals on this flight the crew demonstrated a professional service standard
21520,us airways,6,us airways customer review,reasonable experience on recent flight from philiadelphia to miami oneworld emerald member so used the lounge which was actually quite good flights on time aircraft clean and crew attentive inflight meal ok cannot believe that us airways does not have inflight entertainment come on its prehistoric my other slight annoyance was that when i enquired if i could catch an earlier flight checked in very early i was told that would be 75 my flight was full but the earlier one was less fulljust appears to be cheap especially as my luggage caught the earlier flight and i thought airlines tried to avoid unaccompanied luggage
14009,lot polish airlines,9,id definitely go with them again,the flight attendants were all nice and even though i hadnt ordered vegetarian food in advance its what i ended up getting anyway the food was good and after the long flight from los angeles to warsaw i took a much smaller plane from warsaw to paris even though this flight was only a couple of hours they gave us snacks and drinks and again they were super nice and the service was great my only complaints are that the seats were a bit hard so bringing a cushion or using an extra blanket would help and on the long flight i couldnt charge my phone with the outlet on the seat but these things were minor and id definitely go with them again
16055,phuket air,2,phuket air customer review,intrigued by fern tuppens comments below we were on the same lgwbkk plane on the 24 february and condition wise the cabin was dirty and scruffy torn and stained seat covers and staff service was offhand to say the least are the staff the thai airways rejects because they really do not come close to the thai standards i agree about the flights not being full and have heard rumours that phuket air will have to cut these long haul flights because it is crippling the airline to keep losing money i would not repeat the experience even though i admit it was cheap i do have real concerns for the maintenance and safety standards for this outfit and fear the worst has yet to come for them
16997,royal brunei airlines,5,never fly this airline again,london to dubai i checked my luggage in at around in between 3pm to 4pm my flight was leaving at 5pm my case was over by 3 kilos and staff informed that i must go and take the extra out which i did i went back to her and staff stated that i was 1kg over and if i wanted the extra kilo i would need to pay staff on the other side called me and told me to put my case for her to weigh which i did and the weight was 27 kilos because of the discussions about the weight of my case i was unable to buy any duty free because of the hold up i have flown with this airline many times and have never encountered a problem before after this experience i will never fly this airline again i like the people from brunei and the cabin staffon the flight
17621,saudi arabian airlines,3,customer service is nearly not existing,customer service is nearly not existing a whatsapp number is provided but the wait to be served can be hours when you receive a reply if you dont respond within the minute your request is closed and you have to do all other again so nearly impossible to get through the system similar experience on the phone when you do get through including by raising an official complaint on the system you get told it is resolved but when checking it is not and the loop starts again this is the main issue im facing but overall food quality is below average plans are not very clean and prices are therefore high for what you get im now waiting for over an hour at the head office only customer service center waiting to get served for over 1 hour
20455,thomson airways,7,an acceptable experience,arrived at gatwick to face a tediously slow 45 minute queue to checkin before proceeding through the well renovated security clearance in north terminal swift boarding although flight was delayed an hour whilst sat onboard due to an atc issue which required a rerouting frequent updates provided by a friendly captain once underway food and drinks service prompt and although not generous tasted good ptvs are good but the fimtv selection is very poor c ten films seat pitch good 33 and decent recline although seats are narrow and can be uncomfortable when youve a large person seated beside you as i did on the return flight smooth boarding by bus timely departure and landed 45 minutes early meal service and dutyfree took four hours to be completed which left less than five hours to sleep before being awoken for a reasonably good english breakfast all in all an acceptable experience you get what you pay for value for money and we only opted for thomson due to the direct flights to puerto vallarta to visit friends preferable to a twostop option via madmex
16131,play,3,just too uncomfortable,never again will i fly this airline the seats are uncomfortable and the cabin was so hot i was nauseous also the lack of wifi on such a long flight is untenable especially when flying with young children the staff was lovely but it was just too uncomfortable and expensive for what was offered
6161,brussels airlines,9,this flight was a real bargain,with 130 euros for two just hand luggage this flight was a real bargain i liked the fact that brussels airlines sticks to group boarding also disembarking is row by row and crew sees upon it adequate seating snacks at reasonable prices announcements in dutch french and english and an on time performance even with a delayed departure on the inbound flight didnt like the endless walk to and from the gate at brussels airport though but all in all very good
3317,airasia india,2,seats at different places,bangalore to delhi we are a couple travelling we are tried doing web check 10 hours before the flight and it showed us seats at different places hence we didnt do it we came to counter 1 hr 30 mins before and the attendee allocated same seats which were showing while we tried web check in and she was saying no seats left only paid seats are left now we have to come at least one day before to do check in
19190,starflyer,1,starflyer customer review,cabin was clean personal screen was big enough and a lot of entertainment programs were available seat was very comfortable my personal area was spacious tullys coffee was offered with tasty chocolate flight attendants provided quick and responsive service everything was excellent
8773,ernest airlines,1,extortion of money for luggage,kiev to bologna aggressive policy on extortion of money for luggage my claim is mainly because they do not properly notify about the fact that they do not allow holding any small objects in hands which normally are allowed in the cabin by other airlines i had only one small backpack as hand luggage and my suit which is whatever but definitely not the second hand luggage they forced me to pay and give my backpack to the baggage normally the airlines do not consider mans suit in a soft case as an additional hand luggage and the crew hangs it the cabin but instead i had to put in the shelf and finally my tripod which was tied up to the backpack was lost i think it is stolen and this is the responsibility of the company it would not be stolen if it was in the cabin under my control i wrote my claims to the company and didnt get satisfaction
14108,lufthansa,7,staff acted a bit uncoordinated,the checkin was a bit hesitant since the staff acted a bit uncoordinated and the staff were not well presorted by boarding numbers especially in a destination with a lot of older travelers not really well organized and prepared the flight and the aircraft used were in excellent condition and there were no complaints
15129,nok air,6,not a patch on airasia,first time on nok air as normally take airasia for domestic travel in thailand checkin was nightmare as they did not have my prereserved seat in the emergency exit and tried to charge me 300thb despite the fact i already paid this boarding from a remote stand through buses unlike other airline using an airbridge aircraft was tired an ex ryanair boeing 737 seat was uncomfortable and not a patch on airasia you do get a complimentary cup cake as a snack i will be using airasia for future domestic travel in thailand
18952,spirit airlines,1,a motive to harass the customers,i and my wife travelled on 9th july from las vegas to san jose discourteous in not serving a cup of water before boarding i asked air hostess a cup of water as i wanted to take medicines myself being a senior citizen she told that flight would take off no issue bur after flight take off no response from the air hostess however the male crew was bringing ordered food then i told him which was after half an hour take off then he arranged cup of water through air hostess by travelling in spirit airlines even the basic need for water in a cup is denied even after paying 30 dollars for checked in luggage we were asked to carry the luggage despite our difficulty in carrying it what is the purpose of collecting baggage charges does spirit airlines has a motive to harass the customers it is not the cheapest fare alone matters a minimum travel comfort and courtesy is expected
2523,air new zealand,2,cheapest and stingiest airline,air new zealand the cheapest and stingiest airline in the world on silver tier i have two complimentary lounge passes to use on this flight before i get upgraded to gold tier the app shows two lounge passes but would not load the qr code for the lounge pass via the app and because of this the lounge staff wouldnt let me through because she couldnt scan the code air new zealand you benefitted off charging me 2k a return flight from auckland to brisbane on your variable fares and demand pricing schemes
1100,air botswana,4,air botswana customer review,air botswana to and from johannesburg and maun the staff were friendly and outward journey jnbmain was fine the return journey was chaos to start with the checkin at maun airport was chaotic the lounge was completely full of passengers trying to check in air botswana had chartered another aircraft and upon boarding some passengers had no seats so they were told that they would have to catch the next flight once aboard they told us that the aircraft couldnt take our bags and that they would be in jnb on the next flight apparently 2 hours later i was connecting with a flight to europe and if i had known that earlier i could have labelled my bag accordingly and i might have tried to check my bag through the whole way i felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers they couldnt take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough the problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard we flew via gabarone to refuel then in johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow at least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later however that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as air botswana must have known this in maun he took down all our details and where we wanted our bags sent if we werent staying in johannesburg i honestly didnt expect to see my bag again three days later at home in spain an air botswana rep phones me and asks me which airport in spain i want my bag sent to zaragoza is 15 hours drive away and the nearest airport my bag arrived there 2 days later if any other airline flew between main and johannesburg i would try them i think air botswana needs some competition
6491,caribbean airlines,8,caribbean airlines customer review,port of spain new york return checkin at pos nice flight was on time and b737 was clean however a bit cramped friendly crew snack was a banana nut muffin which was quite a disappointment return staff at jfk were quite unfriendly however the flight was nice and hot sandwich and cold drinks nice movie and friendly crew in a clean but cramped plane
20381,thomas cook airlines,9,nice smooth flight,newcastle to corfu flight left around 1015 mins late due to air traffic control restriction quick ascent seatbelt signs turned off very quickly seat were ok a little cramped if you are tall but the seat itself was comfortable like the fact they have made the backs rigid plastic so if people go into the pockets on the back the person in front shouldnt really feel it there was overhead screens which initially showed the route map and later turned into a childrens film one drink and snack round before meal was served about 1hr 30mins into flight could have been a little quicker as the flight set off at 530am and everyone was ready for breakfast nice smooth flight a few announcements from captain when we flew over the stunning alps flight was uneventful meal was good i enjoyed the breakfast and it was served with tea coffee or juice flight home was great as well food was good although if i was being picky the portions were small but you do get crackers cheese a bread roll and a small pudding to make up for the hot meal being small drinks and snacks are expensive just like any other airline usual sales pitch on duty free goods not many takers on our flight toilets were clean and functioning i find thomas cook fine for these short journeys we have gone with them long haul on the larger planes to vegas and we found them fine for the price we would fly with them again
3136,airasia,3,impossible to talk to a human,booked 7 flights with airasia around 4 months before my holiday around 2 month before the flights were supposed to take place the nightmare started they started to cancel flights for technical reasons sometimes offering alternatives that were not too bad same route just a couple of hours earlier or later sometimes they offered nothing in the end of the 7 flights only 2 happened within 1h of the originally booked time the highlight was a flight that was cancelled and begrudgingly i agreed to their alternative which was 14h earlier after having rearranged the other flights this affected a couple of weeks before the flight the alternative was moved to within 2h of the original flights time even days before the flights they kept moving them around making my heart sink every time i got a message from airasia with the word urgent in the title their customer service chatbot is making it impossible to talk to a human or hand in a claim you just go in circles with it offering you useless options the positives were that if it was other airasia flights that were affected by these cancellations it was pretty painless to move them around and most of the flights were punctual
16506,qantaslink,8,qantaslink customer review,alice springs to cairns in a b717 great crew and a tasty hot meal was served usual good qantaslink service
23067,xl airways france,8,xl airways france customer review,our trip was fine xl got us to paris and back earlier this month with no drama the flight was very smooth and our party of six easily saved 3000 over what the major carriers charge on this route the cabin crew gets high praise for their professionalism and courtesy we would definitely fly xl again
8764,emirates,6,think i would try another airline,a very cramped journey from bali to dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and i am only 5 ft 2 the pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely with just a 1 hour transit in dubai i hopped onto the a380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall the air hostess on this flight were not as friendly a particular air hostess kept telling me off because i crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle i mean we were so squished i fell asleep and they didnt serve me the first meal or even offer a drink when i woke up they just past me as if i didnt exist the second meal was an excellent portion size the food could barely fit on the tray i particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola and cheese and biscuits for the hot food it wasnt impressive i had better food on cheaper airlines the air hostess were ok about re filling my water bottle all in all i think i would try another airline for this long journey next time just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above
16842,rossiya airlines,3,rossiya airlines customer review,ledams echecking doesnt exist so 40minute line at airport onboard almost no room between seats very claustrophobic fas are average with no charisma flights on time hot breakfast is probably the only plus of this airline
1225,air canada,3,treated rudely in security,we had a slight delay at the beginning which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control on the flight my wife became extremely sick we pressed the button to call for an attendant no one ever came to check on us when we landed we had a substantial delay which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control we were late to our connecting flight while in security the first person yelled at us for being late we were treated rudely in security we got to our gate 10 minutes before departure none of the attendants at the gate would talk to us we waited several minutes and then left to find customer service instead the customer service clerk was helpful and quickly scheduled us to the next flight to our city
5175,ba cityflyer,9,impressed with the meal service,madrid to amsterdam via london city airport very good flights with ba cityflyer legroom and comfort on the embraer were good and i was impressed with the meal service from madrid to london a choice of meal tray with cold salad and desert was offered and on every flight a second drink was offered crew was young but very professional and polite transfer at lcy was not great we had to leave the airport and reenter in just 45 minutes
9839,flynas,3,the food on this airline is the absolute worst,the food on this airline is the absolute worst i purchased a sandwich and it was cream cheese on a dry spongy flat hotdog roll i wouldnt feed an animal the staff are sour the plane has never left on time and i have flown them 8 times they also falsely advertise their holiday destinations for sarajevo they have a photo of mostar expensive for the level they are
14572,malindo air,4,hard to recommend this airline,bangkok to kuala lumpur this flight run 4 hours late causing me to miss my connecting flight also with malindo air to perth on inquiring with a representative of malindo air in bangkok airport i was told there was nothing they could do and i would have to wait to sort things out when i got to kl airport they did give me a letter stating the plane had been delayed i would have thought they could have made arrangements before i arrived in kl though on arrival in kl i went straight to the transfer desk as i discussed the issue with your representative a very dissatisfied mob formed behind me while a very upset elderly lady experienced a massive misunderstanding with another malindo representative in time things were sorted for me and a hotel food and a flight the next morning was organized which was great however i didnt reach my hotel until over four hours later some staff were very good however it became obvious that processes and staff training were in need of being fine tuned after only 4 hours at my hotel i was driven back to the airport very early jay at kl was very helpful and although he assured me my luggage would be handled by them when arriving in perth later that day there was no sign of it i arranged to have it sent to my address however this didnt happen instead it was flown to albany airport where i had to drive an hour there and back to pick it up while on the flight from kl to perth i found the crew to be less than helpful i had paid for a meal including a drink of water for the second flight that i had missed because of the delayed flight i showed them evidence of this but they still argued about providing me with a meal i also outlined the bigger picture they were still very reluctant to provide me with the meal i had paid for they tried to tell me that the document i was showing them was for the cost of the flight it was an add on which it clearly stated they even told me i should not be arguing with them all i was doing was asking to have a meal provided that was paid for under the circumstances it would have been wise to make it complimentary anyway the food was horrible even though the airline did some good things and some of their staff performed well late flights yes the second flight didnt run on time either lost luggage argumentative staff and slow processes its makes it incredibly hard to recommend this airline
3836,alaska airlines,7,flight attendants are pretty good,as a firsttime flyer this definitely was a nice introduction to fast travel by airplane pros then cons pros 1 flight boarding time is usually delayed cause airport security or passenger offloading so if youve arrived with barely an hour to get to the terminal after going through tsa and boarding pass first you should reasonably make it 2 flight attendants are pretty good about making you comfortable 3 tolerable wait times for taxiing and whatnot cons 1 the twinengine plane boeing 737 i believe economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia additionally the foldout for laptops is only big enough for the pc you want to use a mouse well need to use another foldout on your right 2 if want additional elbow room firstclass ticket is necessary 3 lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped im skinny and anyone whos taken care of hisher body should be able to use them without difficulty
1253,air canada rouge,4,our experience was extremely disappointing,on our departure from mexico to return to montreal we were shocked to find that our seats were not guaranteed on our flight in fact when checking in at cancun airport we find that we dont have a seat the letters sby are indicated as seat by going to ask the question to the representative of our airline company while going to carry our luggage he tells us that we do not have a seat yet that we are on standby and that we will have to present ourselves 10 minutes at our boarding gate before boarding begins to check with another employee of our airline to ask them for a status report we were so frustrated with the situation and the lack of explanation from our airline the employee didnt seem convinced that we had a seat on the plane even though we had an outward flight and a return flight when we had booked our trip to a resort in mexico with our travel agent moreover it was not our first time on a plane we knew how it worked and we had never experienced such a situation so we headed to our gate and waited for the right moment even when it was time to go see the employee at the boarding gate she didnt seem to know what to say other than probably the system finally my partner and i were called to the gate and finally got seats on the plane so imagine arriving at the airport and learning that your seats are on standby first time in my life that i have lived this also it was not the first time we had flown with this airline on the other hand positive point all the flight attendants on the outward and return plane were very nice and professional nothing to say on this side unfortunately our experience with the airline was extremely disappointing our travel agent did not understand why we did not have a seat on the return plane
699,air algerie,6,air algerie customer review,algaae the flight to annaba took 1hr and was uneventful air algerie will always serve you a drink and a close an eye to your baggage allowance which is good but service is nondescript and like many airlines of north africa when there is a problem there is nobody to speak to and nobody is responsible for anything so when flying them have lots of time on your hand patience and a good book their prices are usually good especially for domestic flights would fly them again but as i said it is nothing memorable
22130,vivaaerobs,1,the worst airline ever,the worst airline ever the airport employees are rude and have the worst attitude they do not try and help and above it being their fault they get an attitude towards you even if you paid for insurance and coverage they do not respect their policies
16125,play,6,the seats are small,online check in is opened 24hr before the flight the personal baggage is included in the ticket and carryon luggage requires extra fee the carryon luggage would be charged if you didnt pay in advance the seats are small even though i am only 170cm tall and i got low back pain after i took a 3 hours flight
15074,nok air,7,pleasant uneventful flight,udon thani to bangkok pleasant uneventful flight friendly crew clean aircraft arrived early quick luggage delivery at don mueang airport checkin in udon male agent could not be bothered opening his mouth to say for instance hello or something as simple as that entire checkin process was done in complete silence at 645am maybe he was still tired
19964,thai airasia,7,no complaints whatsoever,bangkok to udon thani fast checkin at don mueang airport in bkk flight on time enough space for hand luggage friendly staff seat ok short flight no complaints whatsoever
13030,korean air,9,like the foods on board,manila to toronto via seoul incheon i like the foods on board the service and entertainment also the amenities on board
14646,mega maldives airlines,4,never going to fly them again,delhi to male first of all business class in mega maldives airlines is pathetic smaller seats the same as economy just more leg room but no leg rest they provide no lounge access and top of it they have no in flight entertainment its a waste of money if you fly with them in business class i am never going to fly them again or recommend anyone
9366,fiji airways,5,more like a budget airline,on the outward leg to fiji we had selected our seats over 4 months prior and the selected seats were confirmed during online checkin and again when we did the bag drop on date of travel when we reached the boarding gate we were advised that due to safety reasons and load balancing we had been reallocated seats from row 16 to row 36 it transpires that someone else was allocated our original seats making a joke of the reason given the website suggests that inflight entertainment offers a range of movies and other media but in reality economy passengers get to watch a movie on overhead screens serving two rows of seats so 70s style entertainment if you want a wine with your meal you have to pay for it as your choices are juice coffee or water for a front line airline they act more like a budget airline
7354,condor airlines,2,business class below standard,business class below standard despite the new airplane with economy seats fitted into business class shells lying flat definitely not a business class seat very uncomfortable and narrow not suitable for tall people boarding was a mess keeping us waiting 75 minutes standing without any news about what was happening the call centre barely speaks english strange service with first row of business being more expensive and getting different amenities than other passengers kept on promoting paid upgrades until the flight left as if trying to collect money as much as possible definitely a low cost business class below standards airline company despite the publicity made around the new aircraft and seats would not advise to fly condor at all even in business class in the airbus a330 neo
13759,liat,8,liat customer review,check in was orderly for the 0945 sunday flight to trinidads port of spain with boarding commencing on time we took off punctually and crew were polite and friendly handing out boarding cards there was no drinks service on this flight landing on time and disembarkation prompt we made it into the terminal building in time a pleasant uneventful experience
20354,thomas cook airlines,3,plane very cramped,had booked and paid for priority boarding and extra leg rooms seats each way no priority boarding either sector told by check in on outward journey by priority desk to go to the other main queue did receive allocated seats outward but not on homeward for our 4 passengers staff at pmi seem to ignore any prebooking and allocate as they see fit no priority homeward either plane very cramped and one of us could not even get his drinks tray lowered at all as it was so cramped and he is not obese staff were helpful but a very disappointing end to a nice holiday have spoken to cooks who are arranging a refund but i really do not like this hassle over what should be a straightforward booking wont use this airline again
8174,druk air,7,druk air customer review,i was impressed by druk air though admittedly we were business class good food very comfortable seats 2x2 and professional friendly informative staff we flew delhi khtamandu paro and the meal was excellent on board sit on the left for the omost amazing view of 8 of the 10 highest mountains in the world helpfully pointed out by the pilots commentry a319s modern comfortable well maintained and toilets clean business class is definately worth the small supplement exceptional helpfulness of the airline when we were stranded by bad weather in paro
2518,air new zealand,9,was very impressed,very good entertainment screens tasty food even though it was a short flight good space seats did have escape row had a very good flight was very impressed
20232,thai smile airways,5,i was made to check my bag,kudos to the flight attendants who served a meal during this 40 minute flight my seat in smile plus was comfortable but check in was not okay first of all there was a family with some issue ahead of me i was kept waiting for 15 minutes while smile economy passengers and online check in customers were promptly helped by several agents you do not leave your premium passengers waiting longer than economy passengers then i was made to check my bag because it was over 7 kg but many other passengers brought huge heavy bags onboard without anyone stopping them i know because i boarded early and watched everyone else on the flight board why were so many people allowed to bend the rules
20809,transaero airlines,7,transaero airlines customer review,jfk to dme then to kazan overall the flight was enjoyable the food was much better than we received before from aeroflot the crew was nice and spoke mostly russian but did try to speak english on our way back from kazan to moscow dme they wanted to charge us extra for our baggage my wife tried to explain to them that this only one leg of an international flight to new york jfk after a while they waived the extra baggage weight fees overall i would rate transaero about a 7 out of a 10 we did have a 20 hour layover in moscow dme because not enough flights to america
14034,lot polish airlines,3,had a very unpleasant trip,ive been travelling for the first time with lot polish airlines and i had a very unpleasant trip one of the flight attendants was very rude for no reason ive been in the flight with my toddler who is 2 years old and he was a very good boy all the flight sleeping ive been going to ask nice for some water so i can add in to the baby bottle and she looks very disturbed and just pointed me where the water was sitting without saying anything or trying to offer to help me after this i was just having my shoulder a little out of the chair and she came and screamed at me in polish i looked at her and i said sorry i dont speak polish what is happening and she started to yell at me oh of course you speak english i remember all i answered her back was to tell you can ask me nice not screaming or being mad
2158,air malta,5,2 hours flight is the maximum one would want to experience,air malta offers cheap tickets between vie and luqa both flights were on time although the seat configuration of the a320 is similar to their competitors they are still using very old seats that cause the feeling of having absolutely no room at all i think that is the main problem with air malta not sure if they are about to change that or invest into new planes but i would say a 2 hours flight is the maximum one would want to experience there is no real service except the salestrolleys so i was extremly surprised to see 5 cabin crew members on both flights instead of the regular minimum of 4 certainly not because of the work load their business class is a little joke theres not even a cabin divider so i was happy that i did not pay for a lastminute upgrade when available in the cabin the crew was friendly but most of the time all five of them were not visible on both sectors since their competitors on this route are even worse i would say that km is the best option our of vie for flights to luqa
16269,porter airlines,9,impressed with the service,toronto to montreal continue to be impressed with the service at porter my friends and i were travelling returning home on the brink of the covid19 crisis and the entire crew remained upbeat pleasant and incredibly professional during our preboarding and flight thank you to the porter airline organization for getting us home safely and with ease
14418,malaysia airlines,2,website would not allow for the change,i paid extra economy basic for the ability to change my travel date but when attempting to make the change the website would not allow for the change to happen i contacted customer service and the service agent said i had to pay extra for the date change because i was not using the website she acknowledged that i was entitled to a free change and that the website should work but then refused to do anything to resolve the problem this customer service agent was extremely rude and refused to put me through to her manager
22457,volotea,9,one of the best low cost airlines,one of the best low cost airlines punctuality good service and tranquility during the flight if you want to buy you have qr there is music during the flight spanish airline with a good price quality and excellent service i would travel with volotea again if you have questions or problems they have a chat where you can answer questions
5709,blue islands,4,sold its soul to the devil,guernsey to southampton such a huge disappointment that what used to be a great little channel island based airline has now merged with flybe a route that was already relatively expensive for the air miles travelled has now become excessive due to the unreasonable way that flybe charge for absolutely every aspect of your booking including booking seats how else do they propose we travel in an aeroplane and taking luggage this has greatly increased the ticket prices on a recent review of tickets for later in 2017 i found this to have worked out at approximately 100 increase roughly a third increase which i think is disgraceful what used to be a small customer focused company appears to have sold its soul to the devil and been swallowed up by the greedy big boys and i will have to think twice about who we fly with in future such a shame as i always chose blue islands previously for so many positive reasons
20294,thai smile airways,6,so not impressed,the staff service was alright but whats not alright was that my luggage was broken and all i got in return was an offer of 500 baht less than 15 usd or let them fix my luggage which would take around 34 weeks honestly it would cost me more than 500 baht to fix the luggage and in case if it cannot be fixed i couldnt even buy the new luggage with the given money the ticket is more expensive than other airline but the responsibility is not as high as the ticket price if this is how they handle your luggage think about how they will handle other important stuff highly not recommended so not impressed
3633,aircalin,9,surprisingly very good,melbourne to nouma surprisingly very good airline and good business seat for a three hours flight very good staff and very good product in business among them nikko japanese whisky
4797,austrian airlines,6,lose your handluggage,be careful when flying late fridays the plane might be overbooked when they ask you to come forward if you want to check hand luggage in even at no expense from get it done else they will lose your handluggage which just creates big headaches the will not assist you in any way once it is lost
20598,tigerair,3,an unscheduled delay,singapore to denpasar with tigerair this was a trial i usually fly garuda or sq i figured it was worth trying tiger as their itinerary fit what i wanted when i showed up to check in i was given a ticket and the agent asked me to go to the service counter i asked why and he informed me that the flight was 3 hours delayed at the service desk they informed me that i had been unreachable when they tried to inform me about 45 minutes previously as if that would have made a difference i asked why there was a delay and was told it was a maintenance issue or a refilling issue in neither case does that explain an unscheduled delay i certainly wont choose to fly them again without some testimony suggesting my experience is highly irregular
17741,scoot,1,im still waiting for my refund,scoot changed my flight date to 3 days earlier for operation reason and said i can either take this new flight or get a refund i couldnt change my plans at such short notice so i requested a refund in midjune 2022 its now been over 2 months nearly 3 months and im still waiting for my refund ive called them every few weeks and each time they tell me that my refund is at the last stage of the process pending final manager approval they tell me itll be 15 days but they tell me this each time they miss this deadline they wont let me talk to a manager and they wont let me contact the refunds team directly scoot has missed its own refund deadline of 30 business days by a huge margin upon my latest call they said theyll refund me within 34 weeks despite having already failed to pay for nearly 3 months
3749,airswift,7,crews and ground staff friendly,manila to el nido airswift is a philippine boutique airline offering daily roundtrip flights from manila to el nido and this is the only way to go to el nido if you book any property of the el nido resorts you would get a discount on its flight and there is also a vip lounge for guests of el nido resorts in the airport they fly at4 a very old plane do not expect to have much service in this short one hour ride of course also no any entertainment but the crews and ground staff are friendly
10170,frontier airlines,2,dont throw last minute charges,i flew on three separate frontier flights in the space of one week with no food water entertainment it reclining seats before they decided to charge me 40 extra to check my carry on because it was too big on my very last flight it might be low blood sugar and travel fatigue but i have never been more angry at an airline ever in my life i get that you get what you pay for but please be consistent and dont throw last minute charges at the very last leg of the journey
6929,china eastern airlines,7,really not that bad,taipei to sydney via shanghai we flew return sydtpe with transit in kunming on the way to taipei and shanghai pudong on the way back to sydney in december 2019 it was our very first time travelling with china eastern and did not have high expectations to begin with since reading many of those bad reviews here is how it goes for us upon receiving my eticket i cannot use the ticket verification function on their website because the purchase was made through the third party however i was able to select seats on their website so that was good checkin in sydney was easy and quick only then we were made to realize that transit in kunming requires us to get our luggage and go through checkin desk again the staff however said that 3 hours layover should be more than enough for all that process flight from sydney to kunming spacious seats compared to the newer plane from pvg syd however lack of padding so its a bit hard to sleep on entertainment was not too bad not extensive but since my flight was overnight i slept most of the time fas were all smiley but felt a bit robotic meals both dinner and breakfast was ok for us my husband enjoyed his braised pork belly dinner didnt have the alcohol so cant comment on how good or if they had enough throughout the flight do not expect to see nice amenities kit here checkin in kunming was a problem due to the language barrier she kept insisting we dont have proof of residency but didnt relay the message to us wasted about 30 minutes on things that could have been cleared right away should the staff able to relay her concern to us than going around to her manager to finally realised she made a mistake no apologies whatsoever lounge at kunming was just sad and had so little to offer flight from kunming to taipei good seat really good fa service she tried her best to communicate with us in broken english and we really appreciated her for this redemption point after what happened in kunming airport checkin in taipei was easy and she informed us that no need to pick up the luggage in shanghai they will be transferred to our next flight to sydney good lounge at taoyuan airport was very quiet when we were there flight from tpe to pvg same good seat as kunming to taipei good light meal served not so friendly fa unfortunately flight from pvg to syd i had the best service on this leg the seat was comfortable for sleeping with nice loccitane amenities kit i have to applaud the fa serving my row he was thorough sincere and speaks english well personally explained the new procedure on landing at syd even though there is an announcement later on the fa on my husbands row however was not as attentive she didnt even ask what breakfast he likes and suddenly a western set was served overall i think its really not that bad and i wouldnt mind flying with them again if there was a good deal it probably not as nice service in economy class as many bad reviews point at but we didnt have those issues in business class all four flights left on time do notice that the fa will tell you to not use headphone anymore around 1 hour before landing
2866,air seychelles,7,air seychelles customer review,cdgsezcdg business class we traveled on the only b767 with the new business class seats angled lie flat these seats are a great improvement compared to previous pearl class seats outward flight on time inward flight with 1h delay due to late arrival of plane from cdg and slow boarding at sez due to passengers having to walk in heavy rains on the tarmac to reach jet food and wine soso nothing terrific but strangely enough on cdgsez meals were not at all what was shown on the menu staff apologized personal dvd players given for entertainment provided adequate offering of movies overall a decent experience in business class

22944,xiamen airlines,1,airline is the biggest scam,los angeles to bangkok via xiamen this airline is the biggest scam i booked a flight from los angeles to bangkok with three hours layover in xiamen city at the airport i was told that i cant use xiamen airlines because i dont have chinese transit visa xiamen airport does not have transit area for transit passengers so everyone has to go through customs get out of the airport and then walk back in to check in for the next flight be advised you cant get out of the airport unless you have chinese visa i have never heard that you need to get a transit visa for couple of hours layover i was told to cancel my round trip with xiamen airlines and get a refund after 67 hrs of phone calls with the airline i was issued 15 refund of the total cost the agent explained that somehow my outbound ticket was activated i flew with a different airline but they still activated my ticket and the activated ticket was 85 of the cost and im only getting 15 refund for the return flight dont be fulled by this airlines there is a reason they offer cheaper prices they will streal your money and you will end up paying double
20772,transaero airlines,4,transaero airlines customer review,our flight from viedelhi was alright an immense 15 hrs waiting time for the connecting flight though service is minimal food is minimalistic our flight back from delhi was actually ok the ac seems extreme the food was more in quantity but less in quality our 10 hrs for the connecting flight back to vienna turned out to be 13 hrs almost every flight was delayed 25 up to 4 hrs this airport aims for international however the amount of people in the shops and food courts who speak english is almost zero please transaero improve your quality
1421,air china,1,do not recommend anyone to fly it,air china is the worst airline ever their customer service is inexistent they do not answer calls on hold for over 2 hours each time and half their phone numbers for customer service do not work are paying their premium economy is a complete ripoff you basically get the same seat as economy with one seat next to you empty i will never fly this airline again and do not recommend anyone to fly it with this type of customer service
2132,air malawi,6,a very pleasant airline that tries hard,a very pleasant airline that tries hard despite being the national carrier of a very poor country with only 3 planes the service on the 737 is equal to saa the domestic flight on a cessna caravan between blantyre and club mak was perhaps the most fun flight i have ever undertaken the pilot flew low so we could look at the scenery and even made several detours to look at herds of elephants and hippos service on this flight was understandably limited to a help yourself cooler filled with soft drinks but too busy looking out the windows anyway
2201,air malta,7,lost a day of our holiday,flew air malta from gatwick to malta for the 1st time on 28 october flew with them as they included 20kg baggage and they had a mid morning flight as i hate to arrive any where after dark flight was due to leave at 1155 display boards said gate information at 1105 checked at 1105 and it now said information at 1715 went to airline desk who were not that helpful only saying food vouchers would be provided finally took off at 1845 or thereabouts captain apologised said the incomming flight had tech problems and that they had to change aircraft the aircraft was clean cabin crew friendly one guy went out his way to help the couple in front of us with a child in distress inflight meal was a snack but fine when the flight is only 3 hours arrived at our hotel about 1230 am woke up late so effectively lost a day of our holiday i guess these things can happen i had a similar experience with thai airways years ago that caused us to miss connecting flights and taxis flight home no problems same clean aircraft good cabin crew i would use them again and would not tell any one considering to fly with them not too however i was disappointed in the lack of information at gatwick and the indifference of the staff at the airline desk i guess a lot of passengers will b claiming delay compensation under the eu 2162014 rule myself included wonder how airlines make a profit on a flight when it goes like this one
10693,gulf air,8,cabin crew were attentive,pleasant flight although it was an older aircraft and the trip was a little bit bumpy takeoff was on time with no issues at all food was nothing special but it was okay for breakfast cabin crew were attentive
14716,meridiana,7,meridiana customer review,moscowbologna this is one of the very few direct flights from moscow to italy the checkin procedure was fast and the plane left on time plane was an airbus which i like more than boeing because they seem less noisy staff were nice and they served a drink and snack basic service but the price was more than ok however they only speak italian and english not russian which is a pity on a flight to moscow
18698,south african airways,3,i regret my choice,new york to johannesburg south african airways was not my first choice for this trip to new york based on my previous experiences with them i had explored other alternatives with a superior product qatar emirates and several eu carriers but saa is the only airline serving jfk non stop out of johannesburg and i could not afford traveling 12 days vs the 15h direct flight having flown to and back from new york with them last week i regret my choice for the following reasons airport services okish uneventful checkin and boarding experience saa flies their old a340 600 to new york even though i purchased an emergency exit seat on both legs 45d 45f resp and had a very decent legroom the experience was not pleasant as the seats were hard as a rock even with lumbar support and additional pillows and the aircraft clearly showed its age and it felt like its interior was falling apart inflight entertainment more than half of the passengers travelling on my row complained about technical issues with their ife system some of them simply didnt work others like mine worked but with lag and poor sound not great when you have a 15h flight ahead of you cabin crew service i did see a slight improvement vs previous flights as crew seemed a bit nicer and more customer oriented dont think i would fly them again for such a long route again and will rather increase travel time by flying eu or middle east carriers
12842,kenya airways,4,staff lack warmth and are robotic,johannesburg to mumbai via nairobi staff lack professionalism and can be quite brash and rude cabin was too hot even after take off and i requested if they could turn up the air but the cabin attendant didnt seem to understand my request far too much single use packaging throwaway boxes plastic cutlery when they could just as easily use stainless steel cutlery no special meals on 24 of my flights and staff insisted this was not booked even when i was presented with my meal on 2 of other legs had to wait at least 30 minutes both times in nairobi in the plane after landing in the heat as ground staff got the disembarkation ready but no apology or explanation from cabin staff for keeping people standing in the hot crowded airplane staff lack warmth and are robotic and the attention to service when compared with other airlines on similar routes is noticeably absent

15273,norwegian,3,a cheap flight i suppose its great,miami to london gatwick first time flying with norwegian i was very unimpressed how they weigh your carry ons i had a small pull along suitcase full of my babies essentials for the flight and was told it was too heavy and i would have to pay 15 a kilo my suitcase was over by 3 kilos also and the lady serving us just grunted pointed to the left and shouted go go come back when you sort the flight was ok the seats were comfy the tv was actually pretty snazzy and cool but on a long haul flight i was shocked that food is not included free this is a company that does not strive for positive customer feedback they offer cheap flights and its a take it or leave it scenario if you need a cheap flight i suppose its great however if your looking to start your holiday off cheery and happy i suggest flying with someone else
22626,wamos air,3,seats were spacy enough but old,madrid to cancun with wamos air attendants at the gate were kind and let us choose which seats we wanted in the 3x4x3 configuration of the plane the b747 was 22 years old and you could see it right away the seats were spacy enough but old and my neighbors head support was broken my seat had the inflight entertainment box in the foot space the entertainment was awful 2 movies during a 10h flight on a 6inch old and ugly black and white screen why putting entertainment if it is this poor you could not unlock the controller because it was fixed to the arm rest the service was just ok did not answer call buttons you have to pay alchol beverages and the var was only offered 2 times some of the staff english skills were poor and i think that english for an airline attendant is a must the lunch was average and the extras are a little expensive at least the flight was ontime i expect much more from a tour company that will later bring you to a 5star hotel

2371,air moldova,7,decent professional airline,stansted to chiinu pros friendly and helpful staff quick easy checkin at airport free hold baggage and generous cabin baggage tasty fresh complimentary food and wine onboard all far better than i expected cons plane was over an hour late although the staff were very apologetic i think their timetables simply arent robust enough dont have enough slack time and airport turnaround not sufficiently efficient our flight was a late evening flight and having looked at their flight history in general the earlier in the day the flight is the more reliable it seems to be its also relatively expensive but then theres not much competition on flights to chiinu from london overall this is a decent professional airline that looks after you well but it has some scheduling issues to sort out to improve punctuality
14614,mandarin airlines,7,be wary of luggage scales,flew mandarin airlines an ofshoot of china airlines from taichung in taiwan to hong kong checkin although relatively quick was a problem in that my baggage seemed to weigh 29 kg and the counter attendant was adament that i had to pay excess luggage explained to her that my luggage had weighed 20 kg a week earlier flying to taiwan and there was no additional items she would not listen and in a loud voice repeated her call for me to pay extra fortunately my taiwanes colleague who was seeing me of noticed that when i took by luggage of the scales indicated 9kg she reset it and my luggage now weighed 20 kg she was not graceful about her mistake the flight itself was pleasant reasonable leg pitch a nice wrap for breakfast with good coffee and pleasant staff will fly this airline again but will be wary of wrongly set luggage scales

10994,hong kong airlines,7,the crew were extremely nice,the crew were extremely nice the flight was about 4 hours and 5 hours for the flight back to hong kong the flight was really smooth props to the pilots the food was light and average the drinks were cool the in flight entertainment was out of service but pretty sure the airline is on a budget warning that the ticket only includes 7 kg of luggage to take on the plane and have to pay individually for luggage in cargo hold 20 kg round trip more than 800 hkd seat was alright had decent recline trying to avoid flying with hong kong airlines until maybe a few years later when they earn some money back overall above average flight
12499,jetstar asia,6,typical budget airline flight,jetstar is perhaps my least favorite among other low cost airlines operating in singapore but they offered a good option to fly from osaka to singapore via manila so we make the booking fast and efficient checkin japanese style in osaka airport 4 hours of flight to manila and then another 3 or so to singapore nothing special typical budget airline flight no entertainment system foodtobuy drinkstobuy but compared to the low fare it was just good enough basically its better to book them on shorter flights
4639,asiana airlines,4,horrible shell seat,seoul to manila a 35 hr flight the a330300 was archaic horrible 1st generation shell seats this is the same seat that is on the boeing 747400 simply awful narrow making it impossible to sleep on your side ife was virtually nonexistent food was marginal service was okay
16659,regent airways,7,seats were good pitch,dhaka to coxs baza booked a discounted ticket more than a month ago didnt expect too much just on time departure arrival thats what i got boarding luggage handling was smooth cabin crew wasnt exactly cordial but professional enough it was a 40min ride but the captain was able to make it bumpy despite clear weather cheese sandwich cake was good enough for a shorts haul flight like this but as expected no ife aircraft was manufactured in 2001 so common for local bangladeshi carriers but the seats were good pitch even for a dutch national who flew alongside me was well over 6 hope for a similar experience with regent next time
5493,batik air,3,dont fly batik air,pekanbaru to jakarta dont fly batik air starting from the ground service it is the worst actually we got no choice as we ran out seat of garuda indonesia the boarding process is the worst out there there were no specific boarding call for business class passenger passenger with kids etc the plane is quite a new a320 at least we took off on time but landed a bit off schedule due to traffic congestion at jakarta the service was quite friendly it offers you a snack box consisting of a pizza bread and a muffin which is surprisingly quite tasty there were no hot drinks or soft drinks service as they told us bad weather however during most of the flight the weather is pretty fine except when we were about to land in jakarta back to the seat to my surprise again the aircraft is equipped with inflight entertainment however the selection is really bad though the screen is very responsive the seat is also hard unlike garuda indonesia which the seat is so much better than batik pricing wise the ticket is also an overpriced 160 sing dollar with that amount of money i could have flown silk air to some parts of indonesia otherwise please think twice before you book a batik air flight
7816,csa czech airlines,9,i was pleasantly surprised,prague to seoul i was pleasantly surprised about their service everything went smooth from checkin to landing food was fresh and tasty crew was very nice and helpful i did not use the inflight entertainment system much but airshow and music selection was good one let down is that the system is not in czech we were provided with pillow and blanket plus bottle of water which was very nice as i did not have to ask crew whenever i was thirsty both flights departed more or less on time and landed early i wish their service would be so good on all of their flights
1066,air berlin,7,good experience for exchanging miles,dusseldorf to los angeles we are talking here about the too much advertised on all their europe flights on their entertainment screens new air berlin business class seats which indeed are new the technology is great but they are to narrow i tried to sleep i couldnt it was indeed a day flight so i wasnt probably that tired i was expecting more from their sansibar exclusive menu and the portions could have been more generous and served more often for an almost 12h flight i got the opportunity to fly business as an upgrade to economy offered by the airline to its frequent flyers program and i must say it was a good experience after all not the best business class i have flown but a good experience for exchanging miles

17023,royal brunei airlines,9,b787 a wonderful aircraft,flew dubai to denpasar bali via brunei return refreshing cabin cabin crew friendly and great b787 is a wonderful aircraft in terms of comfort ife had sufficient content for an 810hr flight and was good in response food was superb on the shorter route i flew the new a320 very clean and fresh however lacked in ife short transit a breeze at bwn airport but not if you are entering brunei for a long transit youll have to first go to the transfer desk request a sponsor letter following which you pay 5 bruneian for transit visa hotel provided was traders inn brunei comfortable for a transit stop there seems to be some miscommunication between airline ground staff and immigration if this is sorted it would be great i have taken 8 flights in total with the airline had a great time every time
10435,germanwings,4,germanwings customer review,29th july 2013 flight 4u838 from cologne to bologna flight was the second of two that day with the same airline flight delayed 1 hour due to the late arrival of the inbound flight staff kept the passengers informed in a polite and professional manner boarding was orderly and sensibly managed the cabin crew warmly welcomed the passengers the flight had severe turbulence and the crew did little to allay the fears of passengers the lady pilot made a few semiaudible announcements and did seemed to be focused on making up for the delay disembarkation was chaotic as italian passengers pushed to exit the flight the cabin crew did nothing to try and control what could have been a dangerous situation the fare was not the cheapest of fares on offer and due to the abrupt manner of the cabin crew on this flight my experience of germanwings has been soured somewhat i wont use germanwings on this route again

18570,smartwings,8,valueformoney ratio is good,choose this flight to get to tirana for a business trip because it corresponded perfectly with my scheduled meetings and after reading some reviews i was really curious online checkin without problems flight operated under an okflight number but without option to change the allocated seat swift boarding through passenger boarding bridge flight departed and arrived on time cabin was clean and tidy staff friendly and professional seat was ok legroom as well compared to other lcc airlines and given the flight time of less than two hours i am 187 m tall water was served complimentary the choice of drinks and snacks available for purchase is ok overall nothing to complain about the valueformoney ratio is good and if you dont need to work during the flight or expect to get spoiled it seems to be a good choice
20891,transavia,6,doesnt allow for online checkin,the flight left before the scheduled time and arrived well ahead which is always great the aircraft was very clean and staff was nice but transavia doesnt allow for online checkin which given the circumstances makes even less sense than normal also lines for the paris flights were mixed
15891,penair,1,terrible customer service,dutch harbor to anchorage if i could give penair a negative star rating i would and i think that would be being generous i have flown penair at least 30 times i live in rural alaska and they are the only carrier that services our community so that explains why i have had to use their services absolutely terrible customer service from almost everyone i have dealt with at penair lets start with bags rarely do your bags travel on the same plane as you do even though they promise they will also when your bags do finally arrive they will not deliver them to you you will have to take time off work and go pick them up at the airport happen to me at least 20 times gate agents the ones in anchorage are rude and do not care the staff in dutch tries and are nicer but are inept equipment older planes that tend to have mechanical issues which cause delays and cancellations not good air travel does not get much worse that with penair
8596,el al israel airlines,5,seats were not comfortable,tel aviv to vienna both flights were delayed only on our return flight an excuse and explanation was given both flights were oversold and especially in tlv they even tried to seperate groups which is in my opinion an absolute nogo the planes did not look very inviting cleaning was certainly reduced to a minimum crew was quite nice on the flight to tlv experienced and mature crew members but on the flight back there was not even a hint of a smile young ones but certainly with no motivation service was quite surprising somehow i thought on a 35 hours flight there would be offered a bar service or at least a possibility to purchase drinks but they only distributed mediumsize water bottles and an overheated sandwich which had no taste at all seats were not comfortable at all i assume for the chaos at the airport in tlv el al is not really responsible but the checkin area looked and felt extremely disorganized really feel sorry for those people who have to use it frequently
20248,thai smile airways,3,old planes no entertainment,had selected hindu veg meals on booking directly on thai smile website but never provided upon talking to flight attendant they said sorry it doesnt show up at my end i had someone overlook the selection when booking overall flight was average old planes no entertainment uncomfortable seats leg space was okay so that is plus check in counters were minimal so took longer in flight but staff was friendly there thai smile website didnt have good english translation and technical issues for example even if selected meals as hindu vegetarian for both passengers it never was assigned to me upon talking to fight attendants no help was offered and was not able to eat both ways
18585,smartwings,4,a dismal experience,london gatwick t0 prague with smartwings useless online check in not working because its a codeshare huge queue two staff no time for breakfast seat already booked had to ask firmly for it to be changed very unimpressive they were also very inflexible about the cabin baggage i dont think that they understand that were customers not cattle never again a dismal experience

18763,southwest airlines,1,i am disgusted with southwest,i am handicapped in that i have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old i asked for a wheelchair when i booked the flight as i always do this time when i arrived at the airport in philadelphia to return home this was a round trip booking i checked in at the counter and reminded them that i had signed up for a wheelchair she told me to sit down and one would arrive this seemed normal as i have always traveled on southwest and this was the routine well i sat there for over half an hour periodically asking a variety of southwest personnel about the wheelchair they said it was on the way when my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes i began to panic when i asked at the desk again the woman said why dont you just walk i was beginning to think that they thought i could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair i needed at that point i saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it i asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she worked for airline and couldnt take southwest passengers then she said that if i could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me she told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate the plane was boarding it was very clear that had i not approached this person and practically begged her to take me i would have missed my plane my connecting flight and heaven knows when i could have gotten home this would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job i am disgusted with southwest and i never thought i would say this but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs when i called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair in this case there was no wheelchair or pusher and i know thats not true if they dont want to provide this service it should not be offered when i book the flight then i would go to another airline also when the person behind the desk told me to just walk to the gate it was clear that they were not taking my disability seriously and really had no intention of helping me
21583,uzbekistan airways,9,uzbekistan airways customer review,i flew from frankfurt to tashkent and from tashkent to urumqi these are out of the way airports but the service from tashkent to urumqi was fine the counter at frankfurt was very ill equipped to handle all the passengers and needs to be improved but overall the flights were fine the inflight staff was very good
19368,sunwing airlines,2,i will never fly sunwing again,hamilton to varadero we flew out saturday jan 18 of 2020 only to be delayed five hours out of hamilton airport was to arrive at 7pm but landed at 1230 am then we get through customs go to retrieve suitcase not there then when we were to fly back home we were to land at 12 midnight but it was 330 in the morning so overall eight hours lost plus suitcase for three days put in a compensation report to sunwing they reply back is no compensation ive never experienced such bad service i will never fly sunwing airlines again
8719,emirates,1,worst traveling experience,worst traveling experience in last 20 years of business and leisure traveling they tried to force me to give my hand carry bag to luggage to do so they wasted my time asked me to stand on the side and made me go and talk to lot of different people they argue that i can not have hand carry bag and laptop bag separately to make the situation worst another ground staff at the time of entering plane stopped me and pressurized me to board the plane with just laptop bag which anyway going to be in my legroom on many occasions i paid extra and chose emirates for the service and comfort which seems to be a thing of a past from now on i will never choose emirates if i have an option

14312,lynx air,2,what an inexcusable delay,first time flying today and what an inexcusable delay they were understaffed and waiting for crew member this was a poor coordination on the airline original departure delayed less than 3 hours which could have been a basis for compensation if more than 3 hours yet there were no offer of food or drinks 2 hours of lost time just sitting in the airport
6790,cebu pacific,8,overall a good experience,manila to busuanga self checkin and dropoff of the case was quick and effective the aircraft made a wellmaintained impression the seat spacing was good the onboard staff were friendly and the food could be expanded against payment overall a good experience
14671,meridiana,9,courteous and helpful,i travel almost monthly from milano to munich and i appreciate the service and punctuality of the meridiana flight the flight is convenient as it leaves in mid afternoon from linate the city airport and it is always on time also on the return from munich flight assistants are courteous and helpful only drawback is that in milano the plane does not disembark to a finger but uses a bus shuttle i imagine that this is done to save money as fingers are more expensive at least this usually translates into cheap fares compared to aother travel options as car or train as it is not a lowcost carrier meridiana has the advantage of the possibilty to checkin at the airport at no extra cost
22209,vivaaerobs,1,worst airline i have ever experienced,this is the worst airline i have ever experienced the customer service is atrocious i arrived in plenty of time to board my flight the online check in service wasnt working which staff admitted had been a problem all day and so i needed to obtain my boarding pass i waited in this ridiculously long line and arrived with more than an hour until my flight customer service told me i could not check in despite not having checked baggage they continued to tell me i was too late this is more than hour before my flight leaves we continued arguing until 50 mins before my plane would leave and they refused to help me told me i could not have a refund but i could purchase a new ticket to leave 2 days later i had more than enough time to board the plane still and they would not do anything for me i had to cover the costs of a hotel and a new flight with a different airline the next day costing me hundreds i emailed in to discuss this with the company and they again just refused to help me awful customer service and i will never use them again
9015,etihad airways,5,staff did absolute minimum only,masks still have to be worn on board that it getting a bit old felt that staff did absolute minimum only much much interaction with guests needed assistance with luggage when boarding accident a flight attendant assisted but i was on my own after landing nobody cared no free wifi in business class food was fine good wheelchair service after landing in abu dhabi

1487,air dolomiti,2,have her case under her feet,i flew with air dolomiti twice in may even though i was initially supposed to fly with lufthansa but they changed us to air dolomiti both flights were late the first one was 3 hours late and made us miss our connecting flight to the usa the second flight from frankfurt to trieste was one hour late on the second flight they made my mother have her case under her feet because there was no space in the overhead cabins while they let people keep their backpacks and jackets there
19054,srilankan airlines,1,beyond shocking service,our flight from sri lanka ul225 was on 7 april at 625pm we arrived at the airport 3 hours before only to be told that the flight was delayed to 810pm we waited at the boarding gate until 9pm before being told it was delayed again until 10pm at 10pm we were told it was delayed until 7am the following day there was utter chaos and no one knew what was going on eventually we got told we would be put into a hotel for the night we only arrived at the hotel at 130am we were told we would be fetched at 4am for our 7am flight we woke up at 4am to find out we would now be fetched at 6am as our flight was delayed again until 915am eventually we got on the flight at 915am and took off the tvs werent working properly so we only had 1 movie option which wasnt in english and the seats were rock hard after 35 minutes of flying the captain made an announcement that the planes windscreen had cracked and we needed to make an emergency landing back in colombo on arrival at the airport we were informed that the flight has been cancelled they had no further information as to when we would be able to fly their next flight that night only had space for 30 people out of the hundreds on the flight we were last on the list to fly as we were not a family with children and were not fasting so we were told we would maybe fly on monday it was now saturday midday and we had already been at the airport for nearly 24 hours we asked if we could get a refund they said they could not guarantee anything we eventually had to book a one way flight to dubai that afternoon with another airline in order to get home which cost double what our return trip with sri lankan airways cost whether or not we will get refunded i dont know as they dont reply to your emails and on top of that we lost over 1000usd booking a new flight home for the 2 of us beyond shocking service will never ever recommend them to anyone
9394,finnair,2,cabin service lacks big time,not worth the money food options and quality is pretty bad cabin service lacks big time kids had nothing worthwhile to eat and flight attendants were of little help on dallas helsinki leg some weird sweet stuff was served for breakfast dinner options were bad on helsinkidelhi leg there was no breakfast served at all except a sweet bun better to avoid finnair if you are going to india from us

15908,peruvian airlines,5,you get what you pay for,la paz to lima via cuzco its ironic that their slogan is punctuality is our thing while the only thing they can never get right is being on time so if you have a connection flight that same day avoid this airline in my case the flight was delayed only 1 hour so my connection with copa scheduled 6 hours after the scheduled arrival went without problems but as a regular user of la paz airport i have seen flights delayed up to 6 hourswich makes me a lucky man the planes are quite old and doesnt look much taken care of and the leg room is the smallest i have ever seen and that includes regional jets their staff are ok as long as you speak spanishwich can cause problems in the stop in cuzco and their crazy costums and inmigration proceedings and the onboard service is ok taking count the trips are just an hour long each leg maybe is a case of you get what you pay for as their fares are most of the time much cheaper than latam or avianca
4005,allegiant air,1,dont ever fly with allegiant,it was hell from the moment we entered the airport in cincinnati they had zero organization and when we finally got to our gate there was no one at the gate there was no announcements and no gate agent with our take off time came and passed our flight crew arrived and they told everyone were just waiting on the gate agent where is this gate agent no answers no information nothing dont ever fly with allegiant

4735,aurigny air,5,aurigny air customer review,i flew from jersey to alderney via guernsey and experienced delays not really a problem as had been warned by telephone of the delay in guernsey and the fact that it happened in jersey was immaterial everyone was perfectly friendly and civilised however a few days later i flew from alderney to gatwick via guernsey and while the flight was fine and everything on time i found the ground and cabin staff to be offhand at the very least and was made to feel as if i was an idiot when i undid my seatbelt to pay for my drink and when i asked for information on arrival in guernsey i really think that as a small airline if they want to attract customers they should give their staff better training in their general approach just a smile and a pleasant way of speaking would be an improvement on a sigh and a grimace
18170,silver airways,8,our experience was very positive,not sure why all the terrible reviews our experience was very positive flight there and back were on time and not travel issues staff was helpful and friendly this is a small regional airline but they fly nonstop routes that will save you a lot of time and money its no frills but they got the job done comfortably we would use them again

5200,ba cityflyer,8,ba cityflyer customer review,london city to mahon and madrid back into city no delay at check in and a breeze through security 15 mins delayed departing lcy with no explanation from ground staff who just seemed slow an ok hot breakfast and tea coffee was welcome though i was surprised that there was no bar service after the meal was served return from madrid was delayed an hour due to the flight deck walk around finding a scrape which needed checking out a drink from the bar was fine but a 18 gram bag of savoury snacks is an insult city flyer remains superior to flying ba from heathrow mainly due to the e190 being a spacious and new plane however with a bit of effort ba could achieve a better level of service especially around catering
3987,alitalia,2,attitude of crew was terrible,i have travelled with alitalia for more than 20 years and though out this time quality of service and employees attitude has been going up and down in the last three trips however i experienced the worst possible service on both sides old plane flying the intercontinental route low cost type of searing front and back seats broken poor food quality as well as entertainment the attitude of the crew was terrible you can manage one person with a bad day but when three or four through the journey are unnecessarily unpleasant i really wish i had more options to fly out of miami

2698,air pegasus,6,pretty good for a budget airline,overall the airline offered a clean cabin efficient crew almost friendly good seat spacing and ontime service pretty good for a budget airline
22006,vistara,6,interested in blame deflection,when things go well with this airline you get a valueformoney and pretty comfortable experience while getting to wherever youre going the hard product is pretty good newish aircraft and good seat options esp on the a321neo and the flight and cabin crew are easily among the best ive flown with so far when things fall apart such as technical issues ground ops at del is unable to plan ahead or communicate effectively despite having the three hours the flight was delayed to start making plans and arrangements while 2 men worked the other 3 men at the del transfer desk were either folding their arms or looking concerned refusing to answer any questions while a dozen or so pax from a severely delayed incoming flight are either rushing for their connection or were simply brushed away without being given the basic accommodation customer care is only interested in blame deflection rather than feedback repeating statements about technical issues and safety when the feedback was not about the technical delay at all
11319,icelandair,1,nothing good to say here,nothing good to say here one hour layover in keflavik 121822 turned into the 4 days still awaiting reimbursement mid march 2023 airline was completely unhelpful in helping to find accommodations or making our overnight in airport remotely eased for our senior bodies airport staff went out of their way to make it worse paid extra for leg room on every part didnt happen and add an hours delayed flight with med emergency en route and we ended up flying into closest soonest metro airport renting car for return to get home before christmas a travel nightmare still awaiting reimbursement 3 months later

1169,air canada,2,indicated that i was now noshow,an expected 10am departure on ac was cancelled at 8am i spoke with ac call center at 840 philippines and was told that this is either ac or united airline but we cannot be certain i asked to be placed 40 minute call so far on next available flight and she indicated that she would try to reroute me from boston to newark to montreal she then disconnected the line i called back and another indicated that i was now noshow for bostnwkmontreal and all my tickets had been cancelled she indicated that i could now only purchase a first class ticket at 1640 for bosyul at c1600 as no economy seats were available for a meeting that was time sensitive i had no choice i await a refund but discussions with bos help center and yul help center leaves me pessimistic of any resolution
15903,peruvian airlines,1,caused me so many problems,pucallpa to lima this has been my worst experience with an airline i was traveling from pucallpa on 24th july 2018 to lima the flight should have been at 1610 and i was at the airport more than two hours before the flight when i arrived together with my friends my flight was not listed on the departure screens and when finally the peruvian staff got available i was informed that there was a delay 5 hours however i was checked in and knew i would not make my connection flight from lima back to europe at 8pm i was forced to buy a new ticket which cost me 700 usd not only that the new flight got me too late for my work and i lost a customer because of this at the airport the staff did not know any information about the flight nor the plane nor even when there would be the departure instead we kept being promised lied that the flight will depart another hour later and later on again and again in the end the flight departed only at 2345 this caused me so many problems with no compensation whatsoever no apology no support at the airport no interest in the customer this was for the last time i used services of this airline
9877,flynas,6,flynas customer review,ruhjed check in at riyadh airport was ok staff helpful boarding pass says a certain gate however the screen stated another gate flight delayed almost 45 minutes but were not informed screen was still showing on time plane was ok looked a bit tired crew seemed helpful seats looked old i dont like the leather seats but it seems a saudi way of expressing luxury it is a pay for service airline so didnt expect much space between rows is narrow and i felt the seat itself is smaller than regular airlines was not really comfortable but for a short flight was ok upon arriving in jeddah couldnt find the belt for luggage however we finally found it but with a different airline logo and different destination
22811,wow air,8,i had a good experience,after reading lots of reviews i was really sceptical about flying with wow air i still went ahead and booked my ticket to detroit as it was the cheapest option for a one way and i had to book last minute which is always more expensive i decided to pay for selected seats up the front with extra leg room on both flights and got really lucky with having no one in my row for the first flight the second flight i chose a seat with no middle seat and was really happy with this decision as its a cheap airline a lot of people do not pay for the seat upgrade its really not expensive to purchase the extra leg room and well worth it for the comfort plus you will likely not have many people around the food and drink on board is very expensive but as i knew this beforehand i purchased food and water at the airport to take on the flight with me i think i was lucky with the reliability of both my flights taking off on time as this was the one thing i was worried about the seats are very dirty front seat pocket but all airlines are usually quite unhygienic so this was to be expected the service on board i thought was great very friendly staff and attentive overall i would say you get what you pay for and you are taking a risk booking with wow air but lucky for me i had a good experience with them and would book again

13331,lan airlines,5,lan airlines customer review,flew on la801 from scl to syd on 2615 on the outside lans 7879 is a beautiful aircraft on the inside though it is too cramped for a long haul service the 3x4x3 configuration is reasonable however the seats are too close together pax taller than 18 metres and longer legs suffer all the way larger pax also do not fit in the narrow seats comfortably for dinner in the absence of a vegetarian option i was offered ravioli with nothing inside and very little tomato sauce for breakfast a cold ham and cheese sandwich accompanied by a cup of cold coffee no cheese only sandwich a suitable vegetarian option was also not available someone spent so much money on the latest aircraft and forgot to put together a decent menu to feed its cramped passengers whats the story with spanish speaking south american crews no humour i thought this was isolated to aerolineas argentinas but lans crew suffers from the same thing flying emirates next time
6851,china airlines,3,worst flight ive ever been on,new york to taipei this is the worst flight ive ever been on in my life i got a discount on this flight and the stewardesses were nice everything else about was a nightmare i called a week in advance and had to pay for the desired seat i wanted for 30 extra because this airline doesnt let you choose your seat but they ended up giving me the wrong seat anyway rather than 40e which is larger they could not fix the issue on the plane so i was stuck with the tiny seat and wasted my 30 some seats can lift the armrest but the one i had to go to could not and was quite uncomfortable i then learned that this was the first flight ive been on that doesnt offer free wifi i had to pay 50 specifically 4390 to use their very bad wifi service the entertainment tablet doesnt work even if you rub it or clean it and theres nothing on there youve ever heard of anyway the food looked inedible but thats okay because i opted not to eat anyway it just sucks you have to pay for water since tsa obviously doesnt let you bring any liquids on guess i shouldve brought a bigger water bottle sixteen hours of this and they dont even offer you wifi or working power outlets though im surprised we even had those this airline just seems cheap even if their actual prices arent that cheap

15643,openskies,3,wreaked havoc on our vacation,orly to newark with openskies ticketed through british airways my sister and i were returning from barcelona through orly airport with a final destination of newark nj our flight arrived at orly airport at 855 am on jan 19th we had been unable to confirm our boarding passes in barcelona for the next leg of our flight because the british airways app would not allow it upon arriving we proceeded to the british airways counter only to find no associates present we were instructed by another airlines agent that british airways only staff the counter two hours prior to a flight we waited until they came to open the counter and were first in line to get our boarding passes we stayed in the area until closer time for our flight at approximately 1310 we went through security check and entered the boarding area our ticket showed gate 31 we were at gate 31 there were gates a b c d e and f as we looked at the monitor it showed that ba 8003 scheduled to depart at 1340 had closed the boarding process we immediately went to the gate and were told by the associate that the flight had already left the gate it wasnt even 1320 this was a flight scheduled to depart at 1340 and this is the time showing on the monitor the associate at the gate told us he would take us to the booking counter to see what they could do for us when we returned to the counter the time showing on my sisters fitbit was 1324 we were told we had missed our flight and it was taking off my sister showed the associate her fitbit time of 1332 and stated this plane should still be on the ground the associate at the gate stated that the flight departure time had been moved up 3 minutes i assured my sister to not worry that they were trying to help the agent was trying to locate our reservations and when she realized we had booked a travel package she informed us she could not help us other than to book tickets on the next days flight for 1500 per ticket and that we needed to contact our agent she also informed us that her colleague had called our names before closing the door i dont speak french but i do recognize my name and would have heard it if it had been announced after this information my sister again showed her the time on the fitbit which was 1337 and said this plane should still be on the ground i assured her we could not afford 3000 for one way tickets home i asked if there was anything else british airways openskies could do to make this right she said no youll have to contact your agent she was not interested in offering help once she realized we had not booked directly through british airways i am not sure what happened to make flight ba 8003 on january 19 depart early but it wreaked havoc on our vacation not to mention our wallets the real question it left with me however is how the airlines could have announced our names pulled our luggage from the plane and still managed to depart so early the airlines did respond but did not address many of the question that were raised with them customer relations essentially stated we are sorry for your experience
20012,thai airways,5,disappointing for the money we paid,went from singapore to bangkok airbus a350 then on from bangkok to london heathrow boeing 777 positives received 3 meals over 2 flights and all the food was delicious especially the rice this was as a surprise as didnt have high expectations for their food however their was a vegan passenger next to me who was only served fruit the whole flight negatives the seat was uncomfortable and hard with no leg rest but can recline the chair the cabin crew were no longer in their traditional thai outfits they were not that friendly but were present throughout the flight the ground staff at bangkok were not up to the land of smiles name and the crews seemed to lack friendliness although they remained professional and efficient didnt use wifi on both flights so cannot comment on their connectivity cannot comment also on the in flight entertainment but no doubt there would have been choice will fly with them again if you get a cheap deal but overall average disappointing for the money we paid

13393,lan peru,3,lan peru customer review,mexlimmex in business class the outward flight left at midnight with an arrival time of 530am approx this was too short a flight to catch up on much sleep although the plane was new or refurbished almost flat beds and a large screen with avod a full meal service was offered but i decided to get some shuteye instead and slept through until just before landing no breakfast or snack which would have been a nice alternative to the late night meal basic amenity kit no toothbrush and no hot towels prior to landing return flight on a shabby 767 with reclining seats but no avod plane in need of refurbishment with chipped paintwork and frayed carpets fas came round with a drink prior to takeoff and started taking orders for lunch soon after reaching cruising altitude lunch was adequate with an ok choice of chilean wines beers spirits etc the orange juice and coffee instant were undrinkable fas attentive and attempted to get my name right both flights were on time although there was a longish delay for baggage at mex on return caused by thorough checks by sniffer dogs probably to be expected on this route
15790,pegasus airlines,3,my experience was beyond awful,pegasus is a budget airline its main objective is to transport people at the lowest cost possible they do so by removing unnecessary services such as onboard meals and so on no one expects luxury treatment when flying with pegasus the last time i flew with pegasus my experience was beyond awful during checkin i asked an airline representative to check my carryon bag and put it in the luggage compartment instead of the cabin usually airlines dont charge you for this sometimes they even ask you to do it when the flight is full pegasus told me this wasnt allowed but i could pay 50usd for extra baggage allowance and in that case they would be able to check my carryon i agreed upon arrival to my final destination i discovered that a few items were stolen the total amount of damage was insignificant i reported this incident to the airline but they refused to compensate the damage saying pegasuss liability is limited and pegasus accepts no responsibility for any liability over the applicable liability limits in accordance with legal regulations

16446,qantaslink,8,cabin crew were efficient and friendly,qantaslink branded flight operated by alliance airways the plane an embraer e190 had alliance markings but the cabin crew wore qantas uniforms first time on an e190 but id noticed on the qantas website specs the seat pitch was more generous than their b737 between that and the design of the seat it was a very comfortable cabin indeed good space relatively quiet smooth flight particularly the landing the only downside was being a leased plane and not a qantas own aircraft there was no qantas entertainment or inflight wifi this scuttled my plan to do some sightseeing planning while in the air to adelaide but i was content to play some stored tunes and relax in the comfy seat cabin crew were efficient and friendly

828,air astana,4,rescheduled for a morning flight,i booked with air astana for a flight from tashkent to astana transiting in almaty our flight was delayed for over an hour in astana an additional one hour later than my original booking this meant that i now have too short a transit time and need to be rescheduled i received an sms advising that i am rescheduled for a morning flight arrival 10 am the next day instead of 6 pm i then went into frantic messages to my hotel in astana cancelling my booking about aud100 extra for a few hours on checkin i was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me so i am unaware of this land in almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher there i am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm so again frantic messages to my hotel after over 20 minutes running around to get a kazakh sim card to rebook my room i found the place now fully booked called them and thankfully they rebooked my room
15149,nordstar,7,a satisfactory experience,omsk to krasnoyarsk i was a little unsure as to what to expect from a second tier russian company however the check in process was quick and efficient although it was done only in russian and i had to move a little weight from my checked in luggage to my hand luggage the flight departed and arrived on time the plane was quite small but legroom was still adequate it was subject to turbulence as we were approaching the landing the cabin crew appeared not to speak english as announcements were only in russian a good snack was served on the almost two hour long flight my luggage came off the flight fairly quickly all in all a satisfactory experience
3838,alaska airlines,4,been on hold for 6 hours,been on hold for 6 hours booking 7 1200 tickets and the website continues to have issue after issue its like you have the audacity to want to travel these days alaska airlines used to be amazing and generally once on board the flight attendants are good and all is well but the entire process from buying tickets to check in is ungodly now a days god forbid luggage gets lost they also act like its your fault if i didnt live here i wouldnt be flying with them but the free bags as residents keeps me going

12129,jet2com,2,smartlynx ancient a320 extremely poor,leeds bradford to faro flew with this airline because of its reputation as being a cut above its budget rivals legroom is usually better and the new slimline seating more comfortable this time without warning the flight was operated by smartlynx on an ancient a320 with extremely poor and uncomfortable seating and a tiny amount of legroom my thoughts are jet2 should have given me the option to rebook or cancel this flight
15290,norwegian,4,i told him to calm down,copenhagen to gatwick in september 2019 arrived in plenty of time for our flight no luggage to check in so just sat around eventually the gate number came up and we were the furthest you could possibly get from that gate my boy then decides now was a good time to want a wee the toilets at copenhagen were down a set of spiral stairs so we had to leave our trolley and go down when we get back up trolley gone he now wants a sip of water so i stopped and bought one from a nearby shop very slow as none of the machines had water at the departure gate on the way out next thing i hear is our flight number being called as last call the girl at the gate was very nice and said to relax as we werent the last passengers to arrive the guy at the plane started shouting at me about where we were sitting cross words were exchanged by both parties as i told him to calm down whilst i dig out the boarding passes he said i shouldnt tell him to calm down and that he could bar me from the flight he eventually gave in and let us on board later after we had settled in they were serving drinks and i asked for a glass of red wine to go with my meal a cabin staff member said i was not allowed a drink i asked why and was told because he says so pointing to the the small minded petty idiot i had met getting on that man needs to address his anger management and have some customer service training i cant give the airline a bad review because of one person that works for them but i can say hes not a plus point for the airline
6868,china airlines,6,always ask you to show the credit card,taipei to san francisco overall experience is fine the worst part is at the checkin counter they always ask you to show the credit card used for purchasing the ticket when i purchased tickets for my kids and they travel alone they almost got stranded at the airport and couldnt get on the flight
7111,china united airlines,6,the ticket price is cheap,the reason for taking china united airlines this time is that the ticket price is cheapfor the air tickets between beijing and shanghai the prices of other airlines are more than 1000 yuan only china united airlines is 535 yuan because it is a lowcost airline there is no free checked luggage the staff at the ground counter have a very good attitude and high efficiency there is almost no queuing phenomenon china united airlines has only 737 aircraft and it has a full economy class layout compared with other lowcost airlines everyone of china united airlines has sent a bottle of water which is good i bought the meal through the app in advance but it was obviously not so delicious and affordable the seat cant be adjusted there is no entertainment system no small tv no wifi in the whole cabin which is very bad

15221,norwegian,9,we are pleased with norwegian,the flight took off on schedule and landed ahead the cabin is clean delicate and seats are pretty good for a budget airline it is really much better than competitors we have tried service is acceptable but not brilliant crew is smiling and efficient i like the pricing model norwegian uses you by the basic fare and add optionals as required much like buying a car we are pleased with norwegian and will continue using their services the only reason i dont give full score is the somewhat chaotic check in but i suspect that is an airport issue beyond the control of norwegian
5167,ba cityflyer,9,superior service to ba,edinburgh to london city and first time flying ba city flyer and enjoyed the service check in quick and polite security busy but quick too i had an hour in the galleries lounge which was okay for a coffee boarding via a8 and steps on to a nice looking clean e170 seat 1a very nice crew pretty chatty and funny actually departed on time one airborne a coffee and snack offered which apparantly ba proper can no longer afford on the edilhr service its my first time on ba cityflyer my first time on this type of aircraft and my first use of london city landed a few minutes early bags off quickly a great service i find bas franchises or subsidiary operated services such as comair in south africa or ba cityflyer normally operate a superior service to ba
6870,china airlines,7,a decent business class,melbourne to osaka via taipei returning from sapporo overall china airlines offers a decent business class at a reasonable fare both checkin processes were efficient and friendly the lounges in melbourne taipei and sapporo were comfortable without being luxurious good spaces to relax with pleasant food and drink options on board the seats turned into nice lieflat beds the main downside being a lack of storage space around the seats the crews were hardworking polite and generally friendly only soft drinks were offered as a welcome but there was a reasonable wine and spirits list my vegetarian meals were fine but not adventurous no amenities kits were provided and there were no toothbrushespaste provided in the toilets a sign of some cutting of corners in this product three flights operated punctually one was delayed 30 minutes due to ground handling issues taipei is quite an easy transfer point with good signage and friendly staff

6077,british airways,1,cancel your flight without notice,top ten reasons to not use british airways to all be aware and be on notice travel at your own risk i have travelled for years on many different airlines and i have to say that british airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly dont waste your time or money customer service is nonexistent please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your money you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years when you work hard and save your money to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure makes millions on customers per year i understand that sometimes things happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note 1 the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered trust me the number is a secret 2 when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if someone answers they will not resolve your issues instead they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to no one takes ownership 4 what airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesnt have customer service reps to help you the customer british airways thats who 5 they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you at all no email no text 6 if you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary you may or may not get notifications 7 if you pay for seats and you pick them it doesnt matter they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid 8 the flight may be cheaper but it is not once you are done paying for seats 9 they will route to another partner airline and not notify you 10 if you have a connecting flight they will cancel one leg and not the other and not notify you i will never use them again and if this review helps one person that heeds my advice then my job is done
21865,virgin australia,9,i enjoyed the flight,i enjoyed the flight check in was very easy and the flight departed on time the food served was very tasty and the wine served was excellent the staff were very friendly and helpful
9899,flysafair,6,very clean and great service,flysafair is the best very clean and great service i would recommend that the flight attendants who speak on the intercom do not put the phone close to there mouth as no one can hear what they say hold the intercomphone a bit further away from your mouth so people can hear clearly
10221,garuda indonesia,6,there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on,overjoyed about the chance to fly ga in their a330900neo dpscgk few days prior to departure however the aircraft is changed into b777300er check in at ga flight business class always done at its class a dedicated check in lounge one concern on flight ga088 to ams was there were a few passengers moving around the cabin without having a mask on what i found worse was when the cabin crews walked past those passengers and did not notice and did not give any warning once i thought perhaps those passengers just forgot to have their mask on but no afterwards i went to the incharge crews in business class with an angry voice to address my concern as to why they let such things happen in corona times although all ga cabin crews are vaccinated against covid19 they must have been more alert with the onboard situation like on any other airlines i have flown with it makes me wonder is it the lack of english of the crews or just an ignorance i have written a few good reviews about ga flights but not this time they announced that all passengers must sit according to seat number on the boarding pass but this is yet another issue i had to sit in one seat far away from my travel companion because of the social distancing but when one asked to move seat to the empty seat between us it was allowed by the crew ife on ga flights are still below average kindly do an upgrade a pillow on board would have helped my quality of sleep
6807,central mountain air,8,central mountain air customer review,yqq to yvr comox to vancouver for such a small airline and airplane we were pleasantly surprised it was no more expensive for our family of four to take the cma flight than it would be to take the ferry to vancouver and back and for a couple of nights in hotels to make our connecting flights south being a smaller plane it was open seating we were in the emergency seats going both ways and both times the pilots made sure to make eye contact with us when explaining the procedures and asked if we had questions cma is very good about the schedule both flights left on time and arrived on time its a nice short flight being a smaller plane it was a bit bumpy both ways but as someone who has become airsick on bigger jets i had no problem at all the only negative comment i have is that being a prop plane it was very loud and the announcements they made arrival time etc were impossible to hear the recording needs to be louder
21924,virgin australia,8,the flight was uneventful,on checking in two hours prior we were told to come back as we were too early we sat and had coffee as there is not much else to do land side on checking in through the premium lane the staff member was checking in some of the 81 children school trip on our flight so wait we did no lounge in cairns apparently they used to have one boarding was efficient and we were welcomed on board warmly the flight was uneventful entertainment worked fine the chicken we chose was okay nothing special and the potato was gluey nothing as a dessert there should at least be a cookie
11117,horizon air,7,horizon air customer review,ive flown with them 70 maybe 80 times in the last two yearsmostly commute trips from seattle to spokane and occasionally over to montana a few things about the q400 this is not an old or aged aircraft they are extremely fuel efficient compared to jet aircraft they can cover shorter legs in approximately the same time as regional or larger jets they tend to be a bit noisy on the inside particularly between rows 6 and 10 which are nearest the engines most of the examples in horizons fleet are less than five years old i like the fact the q400 can be boarded and deplaned from both front and rear making both processes faster than larger aircraft i agree that this is not an airplane that you would probably want to spend more than about 90 minutes on at a time i greatly prefer the q400 to the bombardier regional jets also flown by horizon horizons flight attendants are the best boarding in seattle spokane and portland is frequently a bit trying delays on horizon are just like any other carrier
16501,qantaslink,9,qantaslink customer review,i took flight qf1509 from sydney to hobart and flight qf1502 from hobart to melbourne both flights were on the b717200 the departure and arrival on both flight was on time despite only having two cabin crew on board the customer service was great and they were happy to help i would definitely take qantaslink if i have the chance
20777,transaero airlines,7,transaero airlines customer review,pekvkotlvvkopek flew with a premium economy seat online checkin was a bit painful due to age old software but the airline staff at the counter were excellent to resolve the issue and made a smooth checkin for us and offered an emergency exit seat i knew before hand about the poor inflight entertainment so i carried an ipad with several movies and music in it cabin crew were on par with other airlines and spoke very little english which wasnt an issue at all no wine or alcohol being served in the cabin but the generous flow of fruit juices candies and chocolates made my travel bit comfortable i would definitely fly them again
17397,s7 siberia airlines,8,s7 siberia airlines customer review,dmekja with iktdme return business class used british airways avios points to get business class to siberia and back outbound flight left late due to connecting passengers return flight ontime service prompt and professional and food much better than i expected fa in both directions spoke reasonable english and even smiled no ife but that is not very important to me
2050,air koryo,2,air koryo customer review,not as lucky as the last writer here travelled on an ancient ilyushin aircraft and whilst happy to reach my destination this is not an airline i would use again no choice this time on my schedule to pyongyang this plane was not maintained well from the surface appearance in the cabin and many seat mechanisms also were broken cabin staff had a fixed smile on boarding and whilst they gave out a meal tray they could not speak or understand english and appeared to rather poorly trained food was as expected i guess but the quality was well below all asian airlines i have ever flown and think it was the cheapest meal ever sampled on a plane
7206,cityjet,6,a lot of technical delays,cityjet is a no nonsense airline with an ageing fleet their avro rj85s are really showing their age now with a lot of technical delays recently my flight wx197 was delayed for almost two hours 02dec on a multitude of reasons initially the scheduled plane had a technical faultthey flew a spare part in from dublin but then the mechanics did not make it on time and a cityjet night stopper was rescheduled this plane then had to be evacuated on a security issue and was no longer available for taking the flight back to amsterdam cityjet took some effort and flew a spare plane from dublin which first had to be completely catered and cleaned once we were ready to go after 1hr 55 on the ground the flight was a normal and eventless flight of 42 minutes these avros are really showing their age not just in reliability but also the cabin and other interior
7942,cyprus airways,7,satisfied with this airline,larnaca to athens a small airline yet efficient in my case the plane was clean seating was very comfortable we had a great welcome from the attendants though i cannot comment on inflight service since i had none if you need something you have to pay for it flight was smooth and arrived ahead of schedule with a captain that kept us posted on our flight on the negative side their in flight magazine in only english and not in greek as well probably only for english speaking passengers i was fully satisfied with this airline
6873,china airlines,1,comfortable and quiet,delhi to taipei service excellent and staff were professional food was far better than expected the plane was very comfortable and quiet after 8 hours plus of travel arrived to taipei flights seem to go quick
20356,thomas cook airlines,3,no explanation was given,we flew through a thomas cook booking with condor airlines the flight was over four hours late leaving los angeles no explanation was given and no refreshments or food vouchers offered they tried to scam us into checking our carryons for a fee at the baggage drop and if we hadnt known our rights they might have succeeded the departure board had departure times that came and went and when we asked at the desk no explanation was given
4333,american eagle,8,was good value for money,short american eagle flight from washington ronald regan to chicago ohare it wasnt perfect the boarding gates were hidden downstairs we were transported to the bus via bus which was waiting definitely too long from the other hand the plane was small so it surely wasnt priority crew was okay nonalcoholic drinks were served comfort was acceptable for the price i paid 70usd it was good value for money
17440,sa express,4,sa express customer review,jnb to richards bay return flight on friday 28 sep 12 flight was delayed by almost 30 min no reason given bad weather when we arrived at richards bay and after two attempts to land was diverted to dur landed safely in dur with the option of flying back to jnb and then out to richards bay the next day or we could travel back to richards bay at our own cost i was fortunate to get a vehicle after waiting an hour for one and travelled back at my own cost pity it is the only operator between jnb and richards bay
954,air austral,6,air austral customer review,sydney to noumea business class fast check in at sydney airport they use the qantas club which was nice boarding delayed for 45minutes due to late arriving aircraft business class roomy and seats comfortable not lie flat but very angled crew spoke mainly french and some broken english but they are a french airline food good service attentive and friendly didnt use the inflight entertainment overall not a bad product
18239,singapore airlines,5,totally disappointing,the a380 layout is nice in appearance but i have never experienced a business class seat that requires you to lay at an angle in order to use the footrest space the seats were the hardest i have ever encountered in business class very uncomfortable my seat on my outbound or return flights operated properly and i had to call for flight attendant assistance numerous times when the seat buttons simply failed to work no amenity kits were provided which was a 1st for any business class flight i have experienced you had to request eye shades ear plugs or slippers with razors combs toothbrushes etc available in the restrooms it was a significant time after boarding before any drinks were served but it was only juice or water no champagne was offered food in both directions were mediocre at best wine offerings were insulting flight attendants pour no more than 2 into the small glasses since that was the serving in the 3 requests we made the cabin staff were polite courteous professional but not nearly as service oriented as qatar or many other 5star airlines we found it quite telling that sg used the air india lounge for their business class passengers at jfk even though air india is regularly rated as 1 of the lowest quality airlines worldwide at least at fra they used air canadas lounge which was a major improvement but there was zero preference for business class passengers at fra boarding overall we found them to be totally disappointing and it failed to deliver the same quality business class service i have had on many other carriers
18053,silkair,4,nothing has changed in 5 months,flew with silk air to colombo from singapore for the second time this year and nothing has changed in 5 months the food is palatable but insufficient and nothing exceptional aircraft mainainance is practically non existent there is no inflight entertainment except that you can purchase the silk air studio app and watch a limited range of a fairly pathetic selection of movies the flight crew however are very friendly and can be chatted with easily in short silk air should not charge its premium fare because it is practically a budget airline with free meals and marginally better legroom in conclusion a dissapointing experience and forgettable to say the least
5531,belavia,7,overall its a decent product,minsk to gatwick the airport in minsk looks like it has been renovated recently and it was modern and efficient boarding was slightly delayed but we got to gatwick on time the aeroplane was fairly comfortable and you get a bit more room in an embraer which has a 2x2 seating configuration the food and beverages were quite good and the aeroplane had some cool branding featuring a tankbased computer game that was developed in belarus cabin crew were a little gruff and could have been warmer and more welcoming but overall its a decent product and good value for money
7403,condor airlines,1,claustrophobic business cabin,claustrophobic business cabin with one bathroom seats become beds only apparently for someone 5 feet 11 perhaps awful limited options food no business lounge in lax no internet on board limited movie collection a serious ripoff think before clicking
10370,germanwings,7,cabin crew were very friendly,flew from dublin to rome via cologne on germanwings website booking is very efficient and due to my fare type i was able to select seat 1d for both flights check in was smooth and all flights left on time again due to fare type i was given a sandwich coffee and bottled water on both flights and the cabin crew were very friendly and professional transfer in cologne was extremely efficient with no need to reclear security and a small and compact airport baggage claim in rome was a zoo but i would blame rome tourism in july for that all in all a very positive experience on germanwings and connecting in cologne would by no means turn me away from flying them again
1364,air caraibes,8,air caraibes customer review,i flew on tx from ory to fdf have to admit i was quite impressed the pa in 3 languages including creole meal was great with caribbean touch and 2 options in eco ptv on board larger than af coi very high density cheaper than other competitors colourful friendly cabin crew and on time performance was great very professional
19146,sriwijaya air,7,overall experience is nice,flew from jakarta to makassar my overall experience is nice the flight is ontime maybe because my flight is the earliest flight of the day the staff is fine and the flight is rather boring but on my 2 hours and 20 minutes flight hot food was distributed the food is rather bland but hot food is still a hot food overall i could recommend my tip for sriwijaya is select the earliest flight out
4110,alliance air,1,worst airline i have ever dealt with,this is the worst airline i have ever dealt with they cancelled my flight notifying me at 2am with no other reason but cancelled i was due to fly out at 8am so had no prior warning and no support from customer service about rescheduling or any sort of help in getting me and my family to our destination the impact of this flight cancellation meant we had missed our connecting flight to dubai and we were unable to change connecting flight to continue on with our holiday so we had no other alternative but to pay extra and return home our refund for the cancellation should be automatic however 3 weeks on and i am still waiting i have sent 45 emails chasing i have also called their customer service costing me 50 just on call chargers and still have not had a resolution the support technical confirmed my email and request will be processed that same day but a week later and still no resolution there is zero care from this airline i recommend all to avoid booking using this airline
14711,meridiana,8,meridiana customer review,travelled from turin catania return with an infant under 2yrs old check in smooth and flight left on time and even landed early both ways crew were friendly and even gave drinks on board at no extra cost which is not bad for a lowcost airline flight from catania to turin was on new a319 and had no problems we have taken meridiana a few times now and have never had any problems and would recommend
6165,brussels airlines,4,4h 20 mins flight without a meal,the boarding was very easy the crew was lovely but that was the only good thing about this flight it was a 4h 20 mins flight without a meal the legroom was not good and yerevan is the only destination above the 2h without the option to buy a hot meal
2188,air malta,3,air malta customer review,i fly this route from malta to amsterdam almost every week and try to avoid air malta as much as possible but sometimes this is not possible even prefer an indirect flight over a direct air malta flight recently additional surprises occurred for months now when flying air malta you get a latvian old lease boeing no room fully booked
13434,lao airlines,7,cabin was very clean,luang prabang to vientiane the flight took off 15 minutes ahead of time and arrived at vientiane half an hour early the cabin was very clean the airlines only provided a bottle of mineral water the crew were kindly they smiled to every passengers
13133,kuwait airways,6,plane was way too cold,friendly staff tasty food comfortable seats and i got moved to a seat with more legroom on own request plane left on time the plane was way too cold the blankets they provided also didnt help that much very unpleasant experience small movie selection
7605,corsair,6,overall good experience,paris orly to pointepitre overall good experience decent food friendly service on the inbound flight outbound all of the crew disappeared at night difficult to get something to drink some security concerns upon landing in paris crew didnt check the cabin at alltwo teens sleeping in lie flat position until touchdown no one to wake them up no one to remind them to put their seat in an upright position never saw that before seats are ok but angled lie flat
8545,egyptair,2,airline should improve,guangzhou to cairo it was a long haul flight with full of tourist groups the aircraft and facility were very old 2 out of 3 ptv touch screens in my row didnt work well and you had to use the remote controller some cabin crew served drinks and food with one hand in the pocket and didnt look professional there was only one choice of snacks between the meals cheese sandwich i think the airline should improve its facility a lot
8722,emirates,5,ground staff are very unfriendly,ground staff are very unfriendly and not helpful making my trip unpleasant to start up with the waiting line is also quite unorganized with no supporting staffs maintaining order nonetheless i was able to check in my luggages and headed to the boarding gate with no big problems seating comfort on the economy class in b777 and food quality are above average the entertainment screen works fine no delays on departure i may not want to fly emirates in the future
12168,jetairfly,5,they always have a delay,miami to brussels i have nothing negative to say about the crew they are friendly and courteous nor about the food i find it rather tasty and well chosen however it irritates me extremely that they always have a delay and you only find out in the airport while checking in it is so hard to send your customers a simple text to inform there is no use to come early to the airport as the flight is delayed with 2 hours on top we get offered a voucher for lunch for a value of 4 dollars 10 cents really not impressed
1278,air canada rouge,3,missing my connection to tampa with united,my initial jazz flight july 23 left 2hours late from vancouver which lead to missing my connection to tampa with united after 2 hours in the united airlines customer service line up i was informed that there was nothing that united could do because air canada was in control of the ticket and they were the only ones that could rebook me on the next flight this has to be the worst policy because there was not an air canada agent anywhere in the denver airport to be found i had no idea how to get this problem solved after and exhausting search i was so distraught that i left the secured area and after more attempts to find an air canada agent i went to the united airlines check in counter the united agent carol ann went above and beyond to help me and while she was on hold with air canada she was busy checking in customers for a departing flight she finally was successful in being able to provide me with a boarding pass onto a flight leaving to tampa the following morning how is it possible that united airlines can be an alliance partner when they do not have authority to get air canada passengers where they are booked to go when the passenger has an existing boarding pass if passengers who find themselves in this situation are supposed to know to call air canada then that is also a poor policy i do not roam with my phone and certainly not going to pay for cell minutes to hold for who knows how long
14126,lufthansa,2,staff unfriendly and abrupt,awful overall from start plane loaded illogically from front to back so last on battling through others food awful and special diet food forgotten about until asked for response given not apologetic but annoyed touchscreens nonresponsive seat recline very difficult and earpiece plug not functioning in 1 ear plug staff unfriendly and abrupt leg room shrunk in last years too

12409,jetstar asia,1,unfairness of this company,blown away with the absolute rudeness and unfairness of this company and its customer service i brought a guitar as a carry on from bali to singapore with no issues on a jetstar flight on my flight from singapore to kuala lumpur they refused to allow me to take my guitar as a carry on and required me to check it they told me it was the previous attendants mistake on the flight from bali i asked for a free bag check and wrap to make sure the guitar would be safe and they declined and insisted i pay for their mistake the guitar was not padded and was not ready for checking i ended up leaving the guitar in the airport since cost of wrapping the guitar and checking it was almost as much as the guitar and the wrapping likely would not have kept the guitar safe the staff was incredibly rude and talked back to me when i was just trying to find a solution to my problem never flying with them again check bags are incredibly overpriced as well and the weight limit for carry on and checked bags is ludicrously low seats are tight and uncomfortable we almost missed our flight from oahu to sydney because the staff didnt communicate that our bags were going through to bali even though we told the first attendant that they were and she told us all was set
14176,lufthansa,5,service is now worse than budget carriers,service is now worse than budget carriers a free bottle of water and a chocolate dont make up for the ridiculous fees for changing seats etc planes are clean staff are friendly but service is no better than a budget carrier and pricing is premium every opportunity to extract money is taken you cant even pick a seat at check in and when a seat is allocated the fees to change are high the app often doesnt work as it should and presents errors preventing you from making changes to bookings
20515,tianjin airlines,7,plenty of room for improvement,nanjing to xian the check in process for this flight was smooth cabin crew were friendly and courteous hot meal with beverages were served however the standard of the in flight catering was neither appealing nor appetizing the passengers who sat next to me even returned the meal to the flight attendant it is indeed below average only chinese movies is available from the drop down led screen tianjin airlines have plenty of room for improvement
19659,tam airlines,3,not let passengers use them,yesterday i flew with my one year old child from sao paolo to london normally bulkhead seats are allocated for parents travelling with young children disabled etc but with tam you have to fork out around 100gbp for this privilege one way all bulkhead seats were empty during the flight but the flight attendants would not let passengers use them they advised that an extra charge applies for those seats if we are going to use them the food and drinks were quite poor we were offered water only twice during 11 hour flight and breakfast was unedible
1479,air corsica,7,air corsica customer review,a good trip i did parisorlycalvi and calvimarseille these trips were fairly good staff at the airport and cabin crew where very good biscuits and a drink served onboard totally normal for the time of the flight which is not longer than one hour and a half however the seat was really small
15971,philippine airlines,4,schedule that was changed three times,this flight is a replacement schedule for the original flight schedule that was changed three times the original flight was supposed to head to hnl then connect to las via a different airline the original schedule had at least 5 hours layover which we were going to use to meet some relatives at the airport pal made adjustments three times until it already affected the connecting flight schedule which pal did not adjust if i hadnt informed them about this it would have been a disaster so the replaced the original schedule into a completely different schedule and airports we have to cancel meeting with my relatives not the first time this happened similarly the outbound flight 10 days ago was also replaced with a different flight schedule and plane also noticed food is not as great as what it was a decade ago we are seriously thinking we wont fly pal again in the future unless they improve
7336,comair,8,comair customer review,another trip from johannesburg to harare 737s both ways and all on time crew were good kept us informed particularly on return flight when there were very strong winds and mine dump dust at joburg outward meal was a hot meal return meal was the whole grain rollthis seems to be standard no complaints at all and plenty of leg room in these old planes
15254,norwegian,2,matter related to coronavirus,no meaningful customer service no reasonable accommodations for matter related to coronavirus took hours to get anyone on phone hung up on rather than connected 4 times agent knew nothing website unclear this is a discount operation in every meaningful way related to interfacing with the airline
3289,airasia india,6,crew were very proactive and good,airasia india from bengaluru to delhi the original time of departure was 0005 hours however there was a delay of 15 minutes which was communicated in advance the boarding pass print and check in of the baggage was performed at the designated points boarding was slightly delayed and as a result of which we ended up being delayed by over 20 minutes the seats inside the airbus were comfortable enough although it could be uncomfortable for longer flights seat pitch was comfortable at 30 inches and for someone who is 510 it was okay the crew were very proactive and good i observed that the crew even provided infant seat belts and snack items we landed at delhi around 2025 minutes behind schedule and the baggage collecting took some time on the coveyor belt overall id say that if you get this flight for a good price and for a reasonable distance it is okay
6251,bulgaria air,4,my biggest problem however was legroom,lisbon to sofia with bulgaria air tasty sandwich served onboard along with complementary bottle of water on boarding which is a nice touch however for a four hour flight it didnt seem enough the aircraft seemed very old and almost decrepit with very worn out leather seats it was the first time i feared for safety when travelling there was much turbulence on departure from portugal cabin crew were young and rather unprofessional they seemed as if they wouldnt want to be bother the flight departed and landed precisely on time my biggest problem however was legroom which made this night flight atrocious
16623,qatar airways,7,they offer free wine,madrid doha sharjah round trip because of the stopover in doha in which you can stay up to 4 days in doha and pay 40 per night in 5 hotel such as marriott marquis doha i didnt want to pay the 83 for the emergency seat as it is too high for a 630 flights the seat pitch in the economy seats on the b787 mad doh b777 doh mad and a320 doh shj is smaller a small difference but my knees could feel the difference the food on the flight is good and of course was happy that on the long flights they offer free wine in doha after passport control i had to wait almost 1 hour because the flight was a bit late the waiting place was so full that there was no place to sit for many passengers the wifi didnt work and there were no toilets in this boarding gate

17970,sichuan airlines,7,no food and drink service during the flight,follow travel procedures carefully i traveled with them on the a350900 from cairo to chengdu due to travel restrictions in china there are procedures that must be followed in order to board the plane to travel to china with sichuan airlines the ticket price is very expensive and ranges between five and nine thousand us dollars for a oneway ticket from cairo to chengdu it is difficult to buy tickets online and you can buy them easily if you know someone in china who can buy them for you or through the companys page on wechat if you are traveling from a third country to egypt to travel with them you must take pcr tests for coronavirus covid19 three times within 48 and twentyfour hours before traveling in three different medical institutions recognized by the chinese embassy in that country and if the result of the virus tests is negative the chinese embassy will give you green light to travel to egypt upon arrival in cairo they will contact you to give you travel instructions that must be followed to travel to china from cairo and then they will add you to the group of travelers on wechat you must have an account on wechat you must take pcr tests for coronavirus covid19 two times before traveling in two different medical institutions recognized by the chinese embassy in cairo they will give you the address and name of the laboratories and the date and time of the tests on whatsapp the first pcr test is conducted fortyeight hours before travel and starts from seven in the morning until ten in the morning if the result of the pcr test is positive they will add you to another group on wechat and you cannot travel if the result of the pcr test is negative they will not contact you and you must do the test again on the day of travel on the day of travel the flight departs at around four oclock in the afternoon you must go to the laboratory to do a pcr test at exactly four oclock in the morning if the result of your examination is positive they will cancel your travel and add you to another group on wechat if the result of the pcr test is negative they will not contact you and you must go to the airport to complete your travel procedures 7you should apply for the electronic health codes you can fill in the information declare your health status and upload relevant documents online you must obtain it before traveling and it is preferable that you do so upon your arrival at the sichuan airlines counter at cairo airport and before completing your other travel procedures you must wear a hazmat suit the airline staff will prevent you from boarding the plane if you are not wearing it and it can be purchased from any medical supplies store in the kasr alaini area in cairo at a cheap price you must wear a face mask during the whole flight the company does not provide food and drink service during the flight upon boarding the plane you will find a plastic bag tied in front of your seat containing some snacks and a small bottle of water you must tell the flight crew if you want to use the bathroom as they sterilize it after any passenger uses it in general the flight from cairo to chengdu was quiet and comfortable
10301,georgian airways,1,they are unresponsive,tibilisi to amsterdam this is one of the most shocking scummy and poor airline i have ever flown with and i travel a lot we booked flights with this airline to armenia and then we had connection with this airline on our way back to uk via amsterdam they didnt informed us about cancellation and they didnt care to apologies or even show any curtest towards their customers very unreliable changing times of their flights all the time so please if anyone buy flights with this airline always check few days before flying as an airline they are unresponsive and will refuse to pay money back for cancellation or just lie to your face about it their english is extremely poor so is russian so im not sure what other language you can communicate with this airline apart from georgian the food on the plane was disgusting and we havent received refreshments at all not talking about the water which you would think would be basic human right the entertainment on a long flights is non existent and staff does not bother on our flight back stewardess was sleeping all the way to amsterdam at the back and if anyone was trying to use toilet at the back of the plane other stewardess was barking at people and could not be more rude and annoyed with people actually being on the plane
19757,tame,9,great customer service,guayaquil to baltra i wish to say a few positive words to review my trip to galapagos with this nice airline which proved to be punctual reliable and with great customer service i had to anticipate my return flight from baltra to guayaquil so i decided to call the customer service on their international line i was a bit scared as reding the previous reviews i was expecting the worse actually the customer assistant on the phone not only spoke perfect english but also managed to help me with the change easily and at no additional cost in few minutes the new ticket was delivered to my email together with all the information regarding the entrance requirements to galapagos the whole checkinboarding process was easy and quite fast both ways and departure and arrival time perfectly punctual the plane was probably a bit outofdate but the crew and the pilots did their best to make the flight as pleasant as possible drinks and a snack were served during both flights and we got lots of announcements from the cockpit smooth takeoff and landing completed the journeys so overall a nice experience and nothing to complain i have to say that i travelled much better than with other airline companies
398,aeroflot russian airlines,3,seats hard leg space good,delhi to moscow flight left on time and reached on time seats hard but leg space good inflight entertainment was problematic to operate press something and something else comes up on the screen no free alcohol served on this flight food served after an hour and a half after take off and meant to be breakfast was terrible and small portions of food next food an hour and a half before arrival a small snack box i will carry my own food with me from moscow back to delhi worse than a low cost airline
14059,lot polish airlines,5,very unprofessional employees,the staff during my trip was nice and helpful i fly by myself with my 8 month old baby but the connected flight i went through the hell airport in warsaw the worst airport ever the employees are so rude and very unprofessional they speak only polish and who cares that they work in airport we needed to run like crazy to catch connected flight no one helped me to take the stroller to the planed i needed to go through the stair with baby and the stroller they also do another check in and the gentleman spins only polish language and it took us so much time to pass control because he could barely talk horrible airport horrible transfer very unprofessional employees rude staff in the airport
2031,air koryo,7,service was perfectly passable,i dont know how things were in the past but there is no current reason for a one star review flew from beijing to pyongyang from a comfort perspective air koryo was just like any international economy class seat yes the inflight entertainment for the 2 hour flight was basically north korean propaganda and magazines from north korea but surely if you are a tourist to north korea that is exactly what you are interested in in fact youd probably prefer that to say big bang theory episode reruns the food was average the service was perfectly passable
7049,china southern airlines,9,has been a wonderful experience,flying with china southern airlines has been a wonderful experience i had a last minute upgrade from economy class to business class at baiyun airport and the staff are very helpful in the upgrading process the vip lounge for china southern airlines in baiyun airport is one of the best lounges in china as they provide private washrooms so i can take a shower and refresh myself before the flight the attendants on board are very welcoming and the facilities on plane is quite new we landed on time without delays
3728,airnorth,9,surprised by the high quality,darwin to dili an excellent flight really surprised by the high quality early morning departure from darwin led to a pretty generous breakfast frittata yoghurt coffee and juice pretty amazing for an hourlong flight and significantly more generous than what we received on our flight up from melbourne on a full priced carrier staff were friendly energetic and professional love the crocodile skin belts a nice touch of the northern territory the return leg from dili left half an hour early ran out of food options early but on an hourlong flight you can cope
2893,air tahiti nui,5,cabin staff did an ok job,the airplane was almost new and was in good condition departed and arrived on time no problems with the checked bags the seat back was a bit on the thin side the new slim seat design seat back video screen worked fine but the selection of movies tv programs etc was rather limited but ok for a night flight food was good but not outstanding and it was served quickly after departure checkin at ppt started only about 3 hr before departure cabin staff did an ok job but were not outstanding as the plane departed at midnight most people wanted to go to sleep rather than anything else overall the flight was as good as or slightly better than flights offered by united airlines
15784,peach aviation,3,peach aviation customer review,to those who complain about european lcs i would recommend a japanese lc as peach to see that easyjet or ryanair are not as bad as they look our flight an a320 was so late on arrival to taipei and departure from taipei that we landed at midnight in kix immigration customs no more transportation available out of airport which is on an island peach did not take any measures at least advising taxis and we were just dropped off in an empty airport they had their profit they did not care as they had apologized for the delay peach sells a taipeiosaka 650 flight which is late in nearly 70 of the cases it always arrives close to the last buses out of osaka airport they know it but risk is at passengers expenses
20309,thomas cook airlines,4,crammed in like sardines,bristol to larnaca a320 of smartlynx airlines painted in thomas cook colours 2 hours late leaving bristol the luggage was on board but apparently the computer had deleted it off the system the luggage had to be unloaded and matched up to the passengers then loaded again seat the most uncomfortable i have ever sat in crammed in like sardines no hot water on the flight so no tea or coffee also ran out of ice halfway through the trip cabin crew were very pleasant but oddly had a rest break halfway through the flight i will not fly on this airline again if i can help it
15166,norse atlantic airways,8,i had a fantastic flight,i had flown norwegian long haul many times before so i had a pretty good idea what i was in for my sister and i had snagged up the flights for a deal we are good travelers no checked bags just cary ons i selected exit row seating when booking 64 and i really need that extra room and it was so worth it the plane was freezing but i noticed they were selling blankets for 5 so i think this was a tactic i am unsure why there is no wifi onboard the onboard entertainment had a decent selection with usb changer on screen i didnt use the inflight entertainment with the limitations of bluetooth headphones flying with norse again soon and i did purchase some traditional head phones so i wont struggle to download shows to my phone all in all they are a budget carrier i had a fantastic flight both too and from no food was provided thats an extra 30 but we knew this and came well prepared flight attendant was nice and was a hold over from the previous norwegian long haul if you are used to norwegian nothing about this airline should surprise you

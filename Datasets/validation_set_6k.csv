15617,onur air,9,onur air customer review,birmingham to dalaman asked for extra legroom seats and got extra legroom at no extra charge we were given seats together in stated row other people said you sit where you like this was not the case check in and boarding no problems took our own meal onto plane as they do not serve a meal but snacks trolley onboard quite expensive but available if you want it had coffee at 3 each plane comfortable and fairly new better than previous thomas cook flights we have flown cabin crew friendly pilot kept us updated no delays
22988,xiamen airlines,4,the meal was poor,xiamen airlines fuzhou to taipei on a b737800 no entertainment system leg room is the smallest of any airline i have flown the meal was poor no taste in a lunchbox with no tray the drink red bean juice was served when the meal is done the staff are at least polite
18663,south african airways,6,seats are blocked off for crew,johannesburg to new york i flew on sa203 and booked a seat in the last row as i knew there were empty seats beside it seat 74d i have a back injury and sitting long haul is difficult so i was hoping to be able to stretch a little i fly this route regularly and always book this seat if it is available and pay to do so in advance as soon as i reached my seat i noticed the tray tables in that row were down the purser for economy was standing there and said she would have to move me i asked why because these seats are blocked off for the crew she said if they were blocked of how was i able to book that seat and it is the seat i always book i have never seen it blocked off i explained to her that i had booked it specifically and she just stared at me i felt very uncomfortable she then blocked off two window seats at the side with her own luggage forbidding another paying passenger hoping to sit there during flight 15 hours her bag stayed on that seat during flight as well as during taxiing takeoff and landing unsecured and despite turbulence twice during the night another cabin crew member told me abruptly that someone would be sitting in my row as their entertainment system wasnt working several do not i did not object but that person never materialized so what is saas policy about this last row and also about bullying passengers finally the same purser and an older female cabin crew member who had been working forward also spent a lot of time complaining audibly about another crew member whom the purser said she would like to stab in the back it was incredibly unprofessional
8783,estonian air,5,estonian air customer review,tllams a busy morning flight on the perennially cramped crj900 compared to my last flight with estonian a year ago the service much better and tallinn airport keeps improving and is now probably the nicest small airport in europe clean free wifi comfy seats and even a library no service whatsoever on estonian air which besides being governmentowned is on par with ryanair for what it offers but as a way to get from point a to point b its acceptable
11016,hong kong airlines,8,would definitely do again,los angeles to bangkok via hong kong flew on same exact brand new a350 blgh on three of the four legs and on an older a330 the a350 was in the new herring bone configuration which is more modern but not necessarily more comfortable than the older business cabin on the 330 checkin ans boarding efficient and quick lounges in lax international lounge and bkk miracle lounge were mediocre in hkg auris great amenities were standard food was good and it was presented well wine selection was limited and drinksrefills were not offered as much as it should be customary in business class cabin crew was hard working and courteous maybe a bit inexperienced my seat 12k got stuck on both long legs and i had to be reseated wifi was only available on the last leg overall an excellent experience and great value for the price paid would definitely do again
1037,air berlin,2,incompetent and disorganized airline,i traveled from new york to warsaw in april 2017 returning from new york was delayed two hours so i missed the connecting flight to warsaw air berlin put us on a flight to amsterdam and on another flight from amsterdam to warsaw on top of that my luggage was lost and i had to wait three hours for it to arrive air berlin get on the ball never have i seen such incompetent and disorganized airline never again will i fly air berlin
5772,blue panorama airlines,1,had to pay the 50 penalty,mykonos to rome if your name in your travel documents does not match your reservation name exactly you must pay 50 each on the spot or they will not let you board the plane the scam is that the airline doesnt have a place for middle names on their reservation system someone said it was because italians dont have middle names as such every american aboard the plane i asked had to pay the 50 penalty also this airline does not carry vodka on board
4874,avelo airlines,2,no different from spirit and frontier,avelo sent discounts promo code like summer 23 or finals50 jet setter which all this codes purpose be 50 off the tickets at is available yes they have expiration day to make the reservation but they dont or give you accepting day long story short they send you all this ads to your email and when you applied the code it dont work and had to call customer for help and they cant even dont know or dont know what to do just waste of time trying to book with them i look at this new airlines company avelo like spirit or frontier hustling people to fly with them we know spirits and frontier airlines are there services and prices that people really not happy just little bit of saving that people get out of it at end avelo airlines is doing the same hustling people that flying with them is cheap but they really not they no different from spirit and frontier airlines
14161,lufthansa,3,avoid lufthansa if i can,at checkin in frankfurt only business class or above have a staffed counter everyone else has to struggle through an automated system once on the plane flying economy you get a bottle of water and a tiny piece of chocolate not only do have to pay for a warm drink but it is also not good and you have to use a card to pay i flew back with klm which still treats passengers like customers i will avoid lufthansa if i can in the future
4051,allegiant air,2,shorted us 15 on the refund,weve been using allegiant air for a while now we recently booked two flights and it automatically upgraded us to some weird bundle which resulted in almost a 200 up charge naturally we cancelled and rebooked the only problem was that we used some of our points to book the first time not only did we not get our points back they shorted us 15 on the refund we waited for hours on the phone to talk with someone never even got through very annoying
1543,air dolomiti,7,air dolomiti customer review,blqmuc with erj195 very comfortable with huge leg room but cabin extremely dirty crew professional and friendly food consisted of just a small packed snack beverages
19323,sunwing airlines,3,never recommend this airline,very disappointing never recommend this airline we found out that our flight is delayed for 65 hours when we were dropping off our luggage at toronto airport even the lady at reception said she just found out about delay we decided to wait at the airport because we took a ride to airport no alert or notifications were sent to us that the flight going to be delayed same thing happened on our return we checked out of our resort and were ready to leave when i just checked online that flight is delayed for 4 hours we have to wait in the resort lobby we could have taken a good use of the day if we had received a notification of the delay few hours earlier do not travel with sunwing
18050,silkair,3,need to step up their game,colombo to singapore the check in at colombo was extremely pleasant and the agent went above and beyond to ensure i had the seats i wanted however this was the end of anything good about silk air i found the crew to be robotic unfriendly and rude meal service is mediocre the worst part about silk air is that there is no entertainment besides the app silk air has disappointed me in the past but this trip with them is my final one the cabin ambiance is depressing and they need to step up their game
16095,play,8,very very nofrills,it was fine very very nofrills and when the person in front of me put his seat all the way back i had mere inches between my nose and the seatback i was really grateful to be able to make it to dublin from new yorknewburgh for less than 300 as someone with a lot of family in ireland and not a lot of money i downloaded a few hours of shows on netflix brought snacks a reusable water bottle and a portable charger although all four of my flights had usb chargers available i had a very good experience with play traveling solo in my 20s without checked baggage i probably wouldnt recommend this for families if you might need to rebook or people who think theyre the main character of each plane they board no theres no wifi but i downloaded and watched most of season 3 of seinfeld and had a nice tanqueray gin and tonic onboard with the money i saved
12623,jetstar pacific,6,jetstar pacific customer review,people need to remember that this is a budget airline i used them for 3 flights within vietnam one of which was severely delayed one was actually brought forward by about 40 mins and the other went without a hitch but i have no complaints but thats the risk you run when flying budget delays and cancellations are inevitable
11264,iberia express,1,smallest space between seats,paris to madrid this airline has the smallest space between seats i cant even open a notebook to work during the flight i avoid this airline just because of that their competitors lowbudgets have more space so if you fly for business and you hope to work during the flight then choose any other airline
11242,iberia express,3,completely disappointing experience with this airline,my first time flying iberia express and it was terrible check in complete chaos unorganized and i waited nearly an hour and only had hand luggage seats very small and no leg room my flight took off 1 hour late which caused me to miss my connection in madrid customer service at airport rude and didnt explain anything just handed me a ticket for the next day when i said i can see online that business seats are open on a later flight same day i was told it isnt possible to put me in business class overall completely disappointing experience with this airline
7718,croatia airlines,8,croatia airlines customer review,seat 4f window from zag to spu on a319 boarding was 30 mins late however only 10 mins late arriving online checkin helped smooth the airport experience inflight experience was adequate the crew young and polite and the catering adequate for such a short flight seats are horribly wornout even though the plane itself doesnt look or feel old
21637,vanilla air,7,vanilla air customer review,vanilla air is a japan lcc i choose this airline because their price is the most competitive but you have to prepare yourself red eye flight the flight attendants are good nothing to complain and always with a smile
11077,hong kong airlines,6,180 degree lieflat bed,hong kong to bangkok in business class with hong kong airlines the aircraft is parked at a remote bay at hkia on a rainy day so got wet as there was no shelter on the staircase to the aircraft service was normal though the aircraft is new with 180 degree lieflat bed food was not bad but rather a small portion comparing to cx or ek on the same route slippers and hot towels were provided quite a big improvement and value for money on this airline
18324,sky airline,6,good manners would go a long way,on july 10 2022 i flew sky airlines from lima to cusco passengers are forced to board the plane by walking on the tarmac on cold weather to be transported by bus to the plane seats are uncomfortable no entertainment onboard no snacks or drinks for my trip double face masks were enforced i was wearing only one but one flight attendant demanded me that i wore two masks instead of one flight crew came out rude and authoritative good manners would go a long way
15368,olympic air,9,cabin crew very helpful,i flew olympic air from athens to chios the cabin crew was very helpful and i was amazed that snacks and drinks were served in such a sort flight about 25 mins the pilots were very informative and performed perfect landing despite strong winds the aircraft was very clean i would fly with olympic air again
19645,tailwind airlines,6,the plane was outdated,brussels to eskisehir with tailwind airlines nice flight the crew was okay the plane was outdated the food was okay too not free or included though there wasnt any kind of inflight entertainment great if you dont want wifi connection or when you dont want to know where you are
6579,cathay pacific airways,5,food was poor in quality and presentation,check in and security check at bkk airport swift cx lounge in bangkok and hong kong very pleasant as always aircraft seat comfort and service topnotch what really spoiled those flights was the really poor catering on both flights the food was poor in quality and presentation i did not see the y class menu but it looked like average economy class food on china an example were the what the menu pompously called a variety of cereals when i asked what the choices were i was handed a small box of kelloggs cornflakes so there was no variety the same applies to wine there is no more choice just one white or one red which were both dreadful i was always very fond of cx but this was just awful catering
6483,caribbean airlines,5,caribbean airlines customer review,toronto yyz trinidad pos guyana geo caribbean airlines flight was quite old school no individual tvs had to stare at a tv from an angle once the movie was done you had to go to sleep because there was nothing else to do crew were quite nice but didnt walk down the aisle frequently usually only when someone pressed the attendant button food was okay return flight was the same
21044,tuifly,5,almost everything is paidservice,this intercontinental tuifly flight from amsterdam to curaao of 10hrs is lowcost so almost everything is paidservice drinks except water and 1 coffee or tea food except 1 meal checkedin luggage starting at 8 x 2 and entertainment starting at 750 x 2 the entertainment you pay for also has little choice and will probably be the same on you return flight also compare leg space i was suprised by this and next time i would choose a slightly more expensive airline to me 80 extra would definitely be worth it besides this the service is good and the airplane is comfortable and clean just make a fair comparison in price between airline options with tuifly you will have at least 40 extra costs
7705,croatia airlines,9,croatia airlines customer review,heathrow to zagreb 8th november and returned 12th november i travelled with a sporting rifle and as a result expected to have problems the booking in going out and returning was smooth and well conducted the staff were very pleasant and helpful the flight was smooth and reasonably comfortable for an economy seat the meal quality has gone down from previous trips but when i consider the price and duration of the flight i think it is very good value i have difficulty walking so always ask for a seat near the front door and in every case i have been obliged
18707,south african airways,3,was a huge disappointment,johannesburg to hong kong saa was a huge disappointment for my daughter and myself the seats and tv screens were dirty the selection of movie were old and outdated they hostess informed us they have run out of certain drinks on the first service order when all the lights were shut down in cabin i assume that means we can all have a nap but it was impossible the staff never stopped talking this went on for hours we would like to support our local airline but after this flight will rethink my future travel decision
7457,copa airlines,3,changed our flight without notice,airline changed our flight without notice they cant help you in montevideo to solve the problem because of the system i bought another ticket from another company to return home
6319,bulgaria air,8,bulgaria air customer review,two return flights on brusselssofia route one on a clean a319 the other embraer 190 staff friendly and helpful good selection of drinks onboard sandwiches were not bad at all if tall try to get an aisle seat next to the emergency exit in the middle of the plane as another review mentioned online checkin is limited only to flights taking off from sofia which is a lack in these times all in all not a bad service and ill fly again
7157,citilink,6,i will recommend,these were in total 4 flights makassar batam gate to singapore and return checkin and ground facilities mixed at makassar very good without hassle good english at the counter checkin in batam careless with bad understanding english one counter for all citilnk flights they did not issue the seats they confirmed verbal best to book seating online stopover ground facilities in jakarta domestic and especially surabaya were dissatisfying kilometers of changig gate in surabaya boarding undisciplined every dedicated seat on my boarsing pass on all of the 4 flights was occupied by another traveller with different seat reservation to chase them off you have tobe rude otherwise they do not give the seat there are no free meals on flight the longest took 25 hours instead a trolley with most meals noodles to brew in a cup so most people buy provision on ground and take it with them important espescially water aircrafts were in excellent condition and cleanliness comfortable seats staff on board and ground was very nice and helpful sometimes a little bit jerky english but it works i think the greatest plus of citilink flights were all in time however due to bad reputation of competing domestic carriers i will recommend citilink for short distances in indonesia
6831,china airlines,3,a 2star budget airline,i had bad experience from the beginning when i came to china airlines lounge and asked if i could use the lounge key of my credit cards the receptionist said no no we never accept lounge key contact them to ask why they put our lounge to the list next my wife and i were seated separately just because they reserved all seats to sell for some more bucks it makes china airlines a 2star budget airline
5112,azerbaijan airlines,9,a very good experience,jfk to tlv via baku with azerbaijan airlines was a very good experience nice plane a340 with plenty of leg space comfortable and the kosher food was also very good they have to work on the transfer process in baku because it takes so long for the security and you have to go through this about 5 times before you get on your connecting flightthey should work on it
6964,china eastern airlines,7,a very pleasant journey,shanghai to rome for economy this is was a very pleasant journey had a seat by the exit which allowed for plenty of leg room hostesses were all friendly the if system could do with a refinement as the volume wasnt good and the choice limited also the food was not great but ok overall
8208,eastern airways,1,eastern airways customer review,started flying regularly from soulba following flybes withdrawal of the route never thought i would say it but bring back flybe the timetable appears to just be general guidance and not something they worry about too much fares are extortionate cant take hand baggage on board planes shabby and noisy have given up and started to use the train
1773,air greenland,4,air greenland customer review,copenhagen snderstrmfjord asiaat and return airbus a330200 very comfortable everyone on economy had their own 7 lcd screen variety of film rather poor the food was excellent the dash7 to asiaat was rather cramped and noisy and we only got two cookies and a glass of juice coffee but what can you expect for a 45 min flight

17554,sata air azores,5,i have no real complaints,boston to ponta delgada return ive seen a lot of negative reviews about azores airlinessata i recently completed four segments with them and found that most of the complaints were not wellfounded to preface this the reader should remember that azores airlines is a budget carrier the azores are a small region of portugal that has been historically underdeveloped if you keep these concepts in mind and adjust your expectations accordingly you can have a positive experience like the one i had i flew two segments on one of azores old a310s bospdl and return there arent many of these around anymore and i was interested to see how it had held up over the 25 years of service the planes seemed to be in good condition with a couple of cosmetic exceptions legroom was not great the flights were less than 5 hours on one we upgraded to exit row seating 20ab and had unlimited leg room it was well worth the 65 pp cost the other two segments pdlbcn and return were on newer a320s these also had limited legroom but were in good condition none of the four flights that i took were delayed all arrived on time i checked luggage on each it was not lost the meals were terrible and there was virtually no inflight entertainment but they got me there on time the flight attendants were helpful and i have no real complaints
9120,eurowings,2,does not take any responsibility,windhoek to manchester via frankfurt provided service is very poor for blankets you have to pay there are no meal options my friend is vegan and finished up hungry on 10h flight as there is no vegetarian option they also have delayed departure by 24h have applied for compensation that belongs to me and no response after 1 month already this airline does not take any responsibility
17851,shandong airlines,4,shandong airlines customer review,hangzhou to shenzhen with this airline the aircraft was b737300 which looked quite aging and also the seats beside me were quite broken the pitch however is excellent which is at least 34 inch another thing that surprised me that we were served hot meal lunch with two choice food as well which were so great in taste and quantity too even china southern that i flew a week earlier only offered snacks during the flight i think shandong airlines is a good choice to fly within china
2107,air madagascar,6,friendly flight attendants,tular to antananarivo quick checkin on time plane a bit old refreshments and a snack served friendly flight attendants the fare was somehow high but this is madagascar you shouldnt come here if you are pampered by lowcost carriers
360,aeroflot russian airlines,2,stood in line for at least 50 minutes,moscow to nalchik i flew abroad with many foreign companies but i never saw that the registration of passengers and baggage was so slow my granddaughter and i stood in line for at least 50 minutes despite the fact that the line was not so long for all the time in the queue there was not a single announcement about the beginning or end of checkin for flights which i initially did not pay attention to but which probably played a decisive role in what happened having preregistered online i did not manage to check in my luggage until the end of registration when it was my turn they suggested that i fly without baggage as a result my granddaughter 14 years old who had no luggage flew out alone while i reissued a ticket at the ticket office the next day august 8 for which i paid 5520 rubles in addition to me other people with similar stories crowded around the ticket office and they all asked the same questions why dont they announce the end of registration why are company employees working so slowly i want to ask one more question why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane but there is no time to complete the registration i believe that a decent airline would return the money to me i filed a complaint with the company but aerofot refused to do this
13263,la compagnie,6,not worth the inconvenience,im really persevering with this airline despite some bad experiences the latest was a few days ago when the london flight was cancelled at 24 hours notice and i was offered the paris flight instead with assistance back to london this is the second time they have brought the flight forward which meant my connecting flight into newark would be too late the first time i re booked at a cost of 300 this time at such short notice the cost would have been a lot more i declined and flew economy on another airline so wasting a 350 ticket on united twice in the past my la compagnie flights have been cancelled altogether one with no notice i found out at check in the other at two weeks notice not only does this constant rescheduling cost money i also have to rearrange hotels car rental etc once on board the service food and comfort is more than acceptable and for the price excellent but unless they can guarantee better reliability no matter how inexpensive they are its just not worth the inconvenience
4455,anadolujet,4,not have a good experience,flight was delayed by an hour no apology explanation or update just left us waiting air hostess was rude for no reason did not have a good experience and will not use again
21398,united airlines,8,wonderful cabin crew,good experience wonderful cabin crew decent preordered meal and okay recliner seats for a five hour trip it seems some effort is being made to upgrade the experience flight left and arrived slightly early the cabin crew actually worked the cabin for the flight not just for the meal service you must have your own device with the united app downloaded in order to enjoy any entertainment but they made several announcements prior to leaving so we all knew
10451,germanwings,5,germanwings customer review,on a recent trip from stuttgart to stansted i had the window seat in a row which was also occupied by a young mother and her four or five year old daughter the minor took the seat next to me once we had achieved cruising altitude the mother produced an ipad from her bag and placed it on the table in front of the child then without the slightest consideration for their fellow passengers a mickey mouse movie was run with the soundtrack coming to all in earshot over the speakers since it was a reasonably short flight i plugged my own headphones in a did my best to ignore the cartoon now that such technology is available i think it might be high time for germanwings to regulate such behavior obviously a sense of social responsibility is no longer sufficient germanwings usually provides a decent service it would be a shame if they allow selfishly ignorant passengers to spoil it
18111,silkair,3,very uncomfortable flight,singapore to darwin with silkair was a very uncomfortable flight i am a short person but the legroom was very tight a german guy sitting across from me was 6ft tall and permanently had his knees buried in the seat in front leg room not designed for taller westerners even though we were travelling to a western country
6087,british airways,3,what an earth is going on at ba,i wasnt going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this as it was a special anniversary it sucked flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats unbelievable the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable this meant no predeparture drinks and a limited selection of food the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time i say this as the new club suites are great
48,adria airways,5,adria airways customer review,i had flights from paris to sarajevo via ljubljana adria airways provides a low cost product these days the food and beverages become for purchase including water this is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their website there are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor besides the service was very friendly and efficient both flights arrived on time
7577,corendon airlines,3,first and last flights with this company,i have been flown corendon airlines twice germanyturkey rt this trip to germany was not very different from the trip to turkey when arriving at the airport they had delayed the plane one hour of course the delayed doubled before we took off my opinion is that this company use twice the time on every task compared to other airlines when they started boarding there was a lot of supervisors with their walkie talkies on max volume trying to divide the passengers into two lines but no system about their work like letting the passenger sitting in the back of the plane enter first the boarding was very slow never seen such long lines to get into the plane the flight itself was like any other flight after arriving in dusseldorf through imigration went very fast then it was the luggage so slow delivery i lost my onward connection it seems like they are happy with their performance and that delays are something the passengers must calculate with when travelling with corendon air this was my two first and last flights with this company
12626,jetstar pacific,5,jetstar pacific customer review,sinsgn price was excellent checkin and boarding was easy flew on an a320 flight attendants seemed in a bad mood seat was uncomfortable little legroom no ife and not enough recline food was extremely cheap but it wasnt really filling it was good though bad presentation of food looked like it was a frozen dinner
8695,emirates,5,they weighed even laptop bag,my wife travelled on 6th may to cochin to auckland via dubai in checkin counter they weighed even laptop bag also and she faced to pay around 27500inr for extra weight and spent around more than 2 hours in the checkin counter even if its as per the guidelines of airline this is the first experience we faced such a value less service we travelled several air lines including low budget they will not add the laptop in luggage weight due to their dignity we saw number of persons facing the same we didnt expected this type squeeze of money from emirates
1817,air india,9,good experience overall,good experience overall positives great leg room for the long flight warm staff higher checkin limits 25kg and smooth landing areas of improvement food could be a tad better but its still decent punctuality
9037,europe airpost,9,europe airpost customer review,i flew from glasgow to halifax in august 2014 with europe airpost i was attracted by the great ticket price and a direct flight to halifax nova scotia the ticket was almost half the price of the major international airlines an extra leg room seat cost 19 euro each outward and 7 euro return each fantastic value the flight was very pleasant a clean aircraft complimentary newspapers headsets and meals the crew was pleasant but unobtrusive flights in both directions departed and arrived on time it is the first transatlantic flight i have made in a small aircraft like this boeing 737 it resulted in smaller than normal queues to embark and disembark and also to reclaim baggage not much else can be said except great flight great price i wish air travel was always like this
475,aerolineas argentinas,5,aerolineas argentinas customer review,ar 1303 april 23rd and ar 1302 april 26th we were looking for a reasonable business class fare from miami to buenos aires we were amazed at how much less expensive aerolineas was than the other carriers that we checked and were worried that it might be due to an inferior flight experience but decided that since were only flying down for three days to attend a wedding he had to go for it well im happy to report that with aerolineas argentinas you dont get what you pay for you get much more the plane we took was an elderly airbus that was a bit tattered especially the bathrooms but the seats were lieflat and comfortable the food was above average much better than american and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured fas on most us legacy carriers i would fly aerolineas again
17650,saudi arabian airlines,4,they just told me to write a review online,flew manila to london via riyadh return with my family 2 adults and 2 children the flight from london to riyadh has a much better experience as the aircraft are newer and have a better entrainment system touch screen however riyadh to manila is a much worse experience in fact on our outward journey the entrainment system was not working for 1 one of us on both legs the return journey was even worse 24 of the entertainment systems were not functional on a 16 hrs journey when i raised a concern to a crew member they just told me to write a review online to influence the as they put it high bosses all in all the experience was just about okay the food was relatively okay and most of the staff approachable will i fly with them again probably not unless the fare will be much cheaper in comparison to other airlines

9491,firefly,2,changing my flight 3 times,singapore to malaysia szb and from malaysia szb to kota bharu the first flight from singapore to szb was already changed by firefly with 30 minutes arrived in szb firefly was changing my flight 3 times during waiting for the boarding first change with 1 hour second by 30 minutes and third by 20 minutes due to the fact a driver and a ferry to my final destination was waiting for me it seems like i am not able to make it on time and i was heading to the airport office for help when asking for a solution first was no compensation possible due to technical issues i have to really make clear i will be not make it to my final destination and getting a noshow fee and have to pay for the driver twice what solution they can offer me instead offered me an overnight stay in a hotel in kota bharu and a ride in a cab to it i tried to explain that my costs are higher than the stay in a rundown hotel and a cab ride there they would like to find a reasonable solution for both sides and that would be a transport on the same day to my vacation destination long story short i would have to pay for the additional boot transfer myself and could then submit this we hotline and email one will then consider this separately due to the delays and circumstances this i did however i got a ridiculous answer and they offered me a refund of 200 myr from the 580 myr i had already paid which is not even half of my costs thus i am now stuck with additional costs that could have been easily taken over by firefly to find a reasonable compensation just save yourself all this inconvenience and book with a reasonable airline that also have an interest in their customers

7635,corsair,5,corsair customer review,parisorly to antananarivo return the staff in the airplane was friendly too but it seems they were just too busy and it took some time until they came after i pressed the stewardbutton the service is nothing special but fair food ok and filling compared to other airlines that i took before eg emirates the entertainment is quite poor for such a long flight the confirmation of the flight back took ages and the lady in the travellers agency i am not sure whether she was corsair employee everything was done by phone was neither able to speak english nor interested the way back is via stdenis where all passengers have to leave the airplane it needs to be cleaned after the trip from paris even if passengers just go in transit they have to pass a security check that takes ages it is only one checkpoint for all transit passengers the flight to paris was as described above all luggage survived whereas hlx managed to brake it on the short connecting flight the arrival at orly is almost at midnight what can make it difficult to get help on the airport or a hotel the big advantage of taking corsair is the luggage limit of 30kg for the big luggage and the lower price compared to other airlines at least at this moment there was no reason to complain about staff i have seen them nicely taking care of parents with babies not really good is the comfort entertainment system is poor
6327,bulgaria air,6,bulgaria air customer review,two return flights on amsterdamsofia route both times on a new and clean a319 staff generally friendly and helpful good selection of drinks onboard the worst thing is the small seat pitch only 29 the a319 in twoclass configuration has 144 seats with 3 additional rows in economy class the sandwiches they serve consist of tasteless bread and cheese for 10 months between the 2 flights the food remained unchanged ground service is slow and staff inefficient online checkin is limited only to flights taking off from sofia and going to particular destinations
18712,south african airways,7,flight attendants very friendly,sa378 11 oct 17 cape town to johannesburg nice presentation ample food scrambled eggs tasted like powdered eggs bland the rest was tasty may i suggest that cabin services introduces warm breadrolls on all its flights domestic regional and international which is almost standard on all asian carriers and on ba international its the little attention to detail that passengers appreciate nothing worse than eating fridge cold bread wrapped in a plastic packet check in staff in cpt not overly friendly or welcoming maybe because of the 04h30 check in flight attendants very friendly purser was very attentive new interior on a320 beautiful sa190 11 oct 17 johannesburg to mauritius lunch meal fish option was bland boring lacking in flavour and colour cold bread roll as above lots of drinks on offer flight attendants on this flight friendly lady purser was super friendly one attractive yc fa was abrupt unsmiling and didnt look like she enjoyed her job also noticed many elderly and overweight crew does saa still apply the bmi weight to height ratio as some airlines aircraft a340300 cabin looked tired with old unresponsive ptvs and in need of refurbishment glad it was only a 3h30m flight sa191 22 oct mauritius to johannesburg dinner service chicken option very nice warm bread roll would have added an extra touch entire crew on this flight very professional and friendly especially the business class stewardess who went out of her way to talk to and offer my american seat mates on honeymoon new york bound on saa that night a bottle of mcc champagne they were super impressed and the lady is a true asset to saa new a320 interior very attractive sa375 22 oct johannesburg to cape town dinner service chicken curry option excellent meal and yummy dessert very bland and boring starter no bread roll with this meal which was ok same friendly purser as on sa378 11 0ct 17 male crew member serving business class had a great sense of humour this crew worked as a team with all four crew members helping each other in yc old a320 cabin looked tired all boarding gate staff were friendly in cpt jnb and mru
13247,la compagnie,2,service almost nonexistent,paris to new york with la compagnie to say i was disappointed with my experience is an understatement firstly the entertainment system is totally useless an entire 8 hour flight without entertainment also 30 minutes before landing the samsung tablets were turned off so we couldnt track our progress coming into land the plane was filthy we flew from paris which is their base airport so you would think extra care would be taken in cleaning my partners so called clean blanket had clumps of hair all over it there was crumbs around my seat and there was dust all around my seat the food was passable at best although i have had better food on a short haul economy flight the cabin crew crew service was poor although friendly apart from the dinner service the service was almost nonexistent apart from dinner the crew never asked us if we wanted any drinks and we felt awkward in asking for one also the crew seemed to ignore our call button which was extremely infuriating we were in the air almost 1 hour before beig offered a proper drink the seats were ok in comfort but once made into a bed they were rather uncomfortable they are not lay flat with your legs being in a much lower position creating a very odd sleeping position the toilets were horrendous as halfway through the flight one decided to stop flushing creating a very nasty surprise for all those who dare venture in i found the flight to be extremely disappointing in my view this is not a business class airline but a premium economy airline with extra legroom the price was the only saving grace for this airline but with the flight experience i had i foresee this airline will not be around for very long

6264,bulgaria air,8,flight was very pleasant,sofia to milan on bulgaria airs embraer 190 as i am a silver member in their frequent flyer program flymore i checked in on the business class counter which saved me time as sometimes the economy class lines are long there is no priority fast lane at sofia airport and my status doesnt allow lounge access boarding was disorganised the flight was full but i had a seat in the front bulgaria air also offers extra legroom seats in row 3 behind business class they offer up to 25 times more legroom for 20 more each way the flight was pleasant there was a snack served a sandwich and a chocolate we landed in milan 20 minutes earlier overall the flight was very pleasant i like to use bulgaria air for shorthaul flights
6965,china eastern airlines,7,i had modest expectations,beijing to hong kong via shanghai i had modest expectations for these flights with china eastern but i was pleasantly surprised there are still vestiges of the airlines struggle with the smoking culture of china they seem to have managed to quash the habit of the flight crew to surreptitiously smoke but in some other places the smell has lingered the van used to transport business class passengers to the parked aircraft smelled like we were traveling inside an overused ashtray other aspects of the experience were more positive the aircraft was clean and neat the flight attendants were cheerful and attentive and did their best to communicate in english i was impressed considering that the first segment was a domestic flight from beijing to shanghai the meal options were well presented beer and wine generously offered but no harder options were available we departed and arrived ontime and my suitcase was on the belt when i cleared immigration the lounge experience was acceptable but i will address that in another review

7913,cubana airlines,4,cubana airlines customer review,i think we were lucky with our flights both our outbound and inbound flights left and arrived on time the planes are quite spacious so there is more legroom in economy than other planes i have flown plus the plane wasnt fully booked so we had 3 seats for 2 people so could spread out the inflight entertainment was awful unless you like watching cuban music videos football documentaries or surgery being performed all of this in spanish with bad english dubbing on the top food was good for airline but was disappointed with the 1 free drink which came for the meal the cabin staff are rude one of whom chewed gum with her mouth open for the whole journey home toilets were pretty disgusting
11101,hop,7,good service and comfort levels,flew amsterdam schiphol to marseille via strasbourg hop has good service and comfort levels for a regional airliner their inflight announcements in english need some work though on my flights i was on an embrear 145 which has an odd seating arrangement of 12 the seats were comfortable and not cramped the flights were staffed by a single cabin manager but they handled the job of getting everyone onboard and serving a complementary drink with a snack on each leg well their inflight announcements in english were completely incomprehensible however as were the recorded announcements in english as well since i dont speak french i just hope they werent telling me anything important on one leg of my flight there was a brief delay but this was communicated in a timely manner
3202,airasia,1,never book with airasia again,flight was cancelled more than 2 weeks prior to departure for operational reasons attempted to secure a refund but it took over 2 weeks just to get a response airasia decided that rather than a 5 hour transit an alternative flight a day later with around 15 hours of travel was a sufficient substitute over 3 weeks later and i am still waiting to understand if i will receive a refund will never book with airasia again
19184,sriwijaya air,7,sriwijaya air customer review,flew cgksin with sriwijaya air to make a change from the usual lion air air asia etc booked online only 48 hours before for the bargain price of 40 usd oneway checkin was fine with no queue and was lucky to get a retro boarding pass from a dotmatrix printer we left 45 mins late but they apologised profusely only about 20 passengers on the flight however the cabin crew told me the return flight from sin was full aircraft was a boeing 737300 in surprisingly good condition and the captain was australian the only disappointment was the food a strange combination of scrambled egg half frozen french fries and carrots however it was still edible and at least food is free unlike the lccs id use sriwijaya air again
10830,hainan airlines,9,valuable fly experience,manchester to shanghai via beijing hainan airlines is a very good airline and it provided me quite valuable fly experience when i travel to shanghai via beijing due to some terms and conditions i had to leave my whisky at the airport and at this time one of hainan airlines crew helped me to sent my items to my home via express she did me such a big favor without asking any payment or reward
21570,uzbekistan airways,6,a bit too rough and ready,london to tashkent plane left and arrived roughly on time very old tatty and worn out boeing 757 with very uncomfortable seat for a night flight and limited legroom cabin crew were friendly but with limited english food was tasty first time flying with uzbekistan airways and wouldnt do it again if there were any other direct flights available all a bit too rough and ready for a 7 hour overnight flight
16556,qatar airways,6,put his seat in full recline position,the seat was small the staff was very nice there was a family of adults in front of us as the plane took off the man put his seat in full recline position and did not move during the flight i had to put my legs under the seat next to him thus preventing my daughter and my wife from sleeping i tried to tell him several times no answers when i realised the family father was next on the right i showed him politely he looked down on me in a very protective way the staff did nothing on this flight but on the second part of the flight on the second plane another guy got reminded to put his seat in standing position whereas he just moved down the seat a little bit for few minutes good point the food is nice and the videos too
7685,croatia airlines,3,not happy,not happy have just paid 75 for excess baggage i believe the costs are too high in comparison to ba and many other credible airline companies croatia airlines failed to offer a possibility of paying excess baggage online and reduce the costs did not offer a possibility of upgrading into a higher flying class to avoid the charges additionally they do not offer online check in and they could only issue me two boarding passes while i have to get the last one in vienna to london even though theyre aware that there is a very limited amount of time between the two fights ill do my best to avoid croatia airlines in future
15135,nok air,2,cabin was filthy,nok air flight from bangkok don muang to phitsanulok was over an hour late and no apology from ground crew the cabin was filthy broken seats airasia rates better than this airline
22664,wingo,1,you will regret it,not even bad service the service with this airline has been nonexistent they lost my bag from bogot to cancun and have not provided any assistance any updates i need to pester them constantly to have basic contact with them additionally all their contact numbers are purposefully made complicated to talk to a real assistant with automated voice prompts which are not helpful theyre a scam and the worst airline ive been on still waiting for my baggage and i have told them its quite urgent as it has my contact lenses in them and im therefore effectively blind and they dont give a hoot i asked about compensation and they said theyre not sure if theyll provide any criminal how this company is allowed to exist every update email i get from them is just a repeat of the message i sent them absolutely useless additionally when i got off at cancun airport no one was able to help as no wingo employees were here so it was like tough luck go off on your merry way now this airline is so incompetent and its a waste of money so to everyone considering using wingo dont you will regret it save your money and avoid this company at all costs which cant even provide basic customer service
8388,edelweiss air,1,seating most uncomfortable,birmingham to san jose via zurich using helvetic airways and edelweiss we used four flights on this particular trip with swiss or its share code partners none of which were on time an average of 1 hour late we had never flown via edelweiss previously and probably will never do so again as the experience was not good our first bad experience was an email request to swiss for assistance about our booking we never had a reply to our request even 14 days after it was put in the only reason we ever did get an answer was because i obtained the email directly to swiss ceo on board the aircraft the service you will receive at best can be described as average in economy class probably a little better in economy plus or business no free alcoholic beverages in economy class you will be charged for a beer or glass of wine with the meal you will receive and the average cost is around 10 per drink comfort on board and hidden extra expense in economy class the seating setup is probably the most uncomfortable we have experienced on a long haul carrier the seats are very tight and small little of no room to move and we are only small bodied people 164 and around 70kgs although the aircraft are new and clean the comfort level in economy class is extremely bad and we would not recommend it if your baggage is overweight above 23kgs you will be charged an excess baggage fee of approximately 200 per suitcase
2391,air moldova,8,air moldova customer review,otpkivist return otpkiv canceled due to fog instead put on the tk service to ist for the istkiv on well maintained embraer 190 with friendly and professional fas kivotp delayed 15 hours but they kept passengers informed boarding was a bit chaotic as they could not figure which plane should depart first they used a fairly old but clean a320200 and staff were nice for the price paid attentive service and helpful staff
6550,cathay dragon,8,fine except the food,hong kong to taipei it was a evening flight and they operated this very short haul route with a wide body aircraft with personal tv only snacks were provided with no main course which was quite disappointing cabin crew was efficient and they managed to offered me customised drink in a short time flight was a bit delayed due to traffic the overall experience was fine except the food

12592,jetstar pacific,8,staff were friendly,flew jetstar pacific from hanoi to ho chi minh got an email a week prior to flight saying that it had been rescheduled to half an hour earlier than the original time check in was easy plane took off a little late pretty much the original booked time and the staff were friendly reminded me of easyjet in the uk no problems and cheap also got assigned the extra leg room seats probably because all 4 of us were tall and we didnt even have to ask
15769,peach aviation,4,will not fly peach again,osaka to okinawa never again i hope even at osaka airport their gates are far away and seem remote and isolated the flight crew were pleasant enough there is the low amount of amenities and attention ive come to expect from an lcc i never had any doubts about the safety of the flight the plane seemed in new condition and the crew very professional but at arriving at naha okinawa on time i became very frustrated with peach once again i soon found out we were deposited into a far away terminal but this one was even more remote than at osaka it felt like i was in a hot warehouse after claiming my bag of course i had to pay to check my 1 bag at least jeju air lets you check a bag for free and doesnt make you sweat and wait in some forgotten place there was a long line to get outside i had no idea what the line was for why we were waiting and why the line of people was not moving there were no peach employees anywhere to be seen after about 10 minutes in line i thought i saw a peach employee walking by going into an office door so i attempted to call out to her i am fairly certain she heard me and made eye contact with me but went through the door anyway and closed it behind her a few more minutes passed and i was able to find out from an employee of a rental car company that we were waiting in line for a shuttle bus to take us to the main terminal i then noticed that there were indeed buses coming but so infrequently that it took at least 30 minutes of standing in the peach warehouse apparently no ac for it was hot in there before i and most other passengers were able to board their shuttle to the proper terminal a 5 minute ride packed full still hot i went on their website today to make a complaint and i could find nowhere any contact information for them only ways to book a flight take your and kiss you goodbye i will not fly peach again

13505,latam airlines,6,flight was quite uneventful,this flight reminded me of flying with latam during the pandemic check in at the airport was a breeze and flight left on time unfortunately their onboard movie app did not work at all and due to there being a lot of turbulence the crew stopped serving water after only a few rows so this flight was quite uneventful

5751,blue islands,5,blue islands customer review,i like small aeroplanes therefore the blue islands jetstream 32 southamptonguernsey return was terrific from a customers point of view it was excellent on time both ways use of lounges flexible tickets as standard nothing to complain about really the real experience is going an aircraft where the first officer is the cabin crew the cockpit door is open and everyone gets a big window to look out of it is all very informal and good fun just like flying used to be i admit i would not want to take a very long flight in a jetstream they are quite noisy but for this sort of journey it was perfect blue islands treat you as a person not a piece of selfloading freight
6400,cape air,5,cape air customer review,boston to provincetown return many time over this last summer this is a wonderful airline from the moment you make your reservation you actually feel like every employee you come into contact with cares about you granted the planes are small no inflight services since most of the flights are so short but you feel important earlier this summer i experienced weather related delays and the gate staff at the provincetown airport sent out for pizza to feed us on the ground while we waited for clearance to take off i know of no other airline that still treats its customers with such genuine attention
8243,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,checked in by friendly and helpful girl at leedsbradford straight through fastrack eleven passengers in jetstream so plenty of room flight attendant was friendly and welcoming drinkssnacks chatty captain landing at southampton bng on time despite the extra cost probably less if i didnt have to book the day before because of family bereavement i will choose them if possible next time i fly before this flight i had never heard of them
9666,fly540com,1,customer service is one of the worse,lamu to nairobi due to the coronovirus outbreak we had to cancel our trip to kenya and i have emailed them three times and i never got a response on the online chat they seem not to respond at all or they are very slow and can not issue a refund i do not know how is to fly with them but their customer service is one of the worse the problem is that if you are one of the few companies flying between two destination you are bound to pick one of the two really shame that they are so useless
9385,fiji airways,3,product could be improved,los angeles to christchurch via nadi with fiji airways the people couldnt be nicer but the product could be improved the food wasnt very good on the outbound breakfast was served on a noon flight from fiji to new zealand it should have been lunch the inflight entertainment was very limited and the angle seats were not flat the pillow was the worst ive ever had in business class
5335,bangkok airways,1,friendly yet hardworking people,i was booked on a flight from trat to bangkok during october 2020 a tropical storm was passing through trat and meant that there was severe rain and low visibility throughout the day unsurprisingly the captain of the inbound from bangkok decided to go around and after holding for a bit flew back to bangkok initially i did not ask the ground crew for any information as i was tracking the flight and storm online they initially announced the delay as we will inform you the new time later and it became obvious after a while that the delay would be quite a while they seemed to have multiple contingencies in place even with the covid situation and another plane with another set of crew was sent to trat as the previous crew and aircraft exceeded their legal allowed flying time during the wait the ground staff were on hand to help passengers and in general handled the situation like it was an everyday thing to them it really helped the passengers feel relaxed and not stressed they even offered to try to rebook passengers who were connecting on other airlines which is clearly going above and beyond their responsibilities i had a guide to what delayed passengers were entitled to and a 2 hour plus delay meant a meal would be provided they did get us a hot lunch box delivered as there isnt a restaurant on site in the end the weather cleared up and the replacement aircraft landed and the ground crews worked to turn around the aircraft and literally as the last passenger boarded the doors closed and we were off pushing back 3 hours and 10 minutes later than our scheduled departure time service onboard was done as a snack box which contained packet nuts a savoury chicken pastry and a bottle of water it wasnt too much to write home about but it sets bangkok airways apart from their lowcost competition the crew were very hardworking although i think they seemed a bit robotic today but in general bangkok airways crew and staff are very casual and friendly yet hardworking people baggage arrived very quickly in suvarnabhumi airport which seems to become more consistent as they have upgraded their systems i think that the way an airline is appropriately judged is how they handle a crisis and in this case they put the safety of passengers first and foremost yet still handled the situation extremely well i think this is a textbook example of how to handle a flight delay and i applaud bangkok airways for making our day as stressfree as it couldve possibly been if only other airlines handled delays this well
19459,swoop,1,flight rescheduled 4 times,this airline company should not exist never tried it before and will never use it again there is no phone to call the email or messenger has no value as no one will respond our flight got rescheduled 4 times and last night was changed again and our last day of our vacations has been a disaster all day in airport and we are supposed to leave at 1115pm and arrive maybe at 3am originally scheduled to arrive by 730pm there is no consideration from this company to any customer
9494,firefly,8,bad weather resulting delay departure,flight itself was full sitting inside the cabin 20mins for waiting another plane to land so we have had to hold short at the runway longer time bad weather resulting delay departure powerful turbo plane a small packs of cookies nuts and drinking water was provided as a refreshment
14097,lufthansa,4,no free food no free drinks,after several disappointing trips with lufthansa business with terrible seats and inedible food i decided to fly lufthansa economy only when using this airline the boarding process was easy and well organised the seat was rather small and flimsy with not much legroom lufthansa forked out a small bottle of water thats it no free food no free drinks honestly i dont see why not flying budget carriers there is no difference except maybe the real priority boarding offered by the flag carriers
4593,asiana airlines,7,not really interacting with passengers,smooth checkin in business class area being star alliance gold member could get in their lounge which looks great but has little food and drink options flight with ok seatpitch and ok food several rounds of drinks crew not really interacting with passengers i didnt really feel welcome strangely i always have this feeling with asiana
10706,gulf air,6,worst cabin crew i experienced,the aircraft were well maintained and new the crew on the tbilisi to bahrain flight were very courteous and professional the service was excellent and the vegetarian meal was very good there was a delay of 50 minutes to the flight not the fault of gulf air but because the transit time was only an hour and fifteen minutes i had to run or i wouldnt have made it to the gate in time the flight from bahrain to bengaluru was 80 empty this should mean excellent service but that was not the case the crew on this flight were the worst cabin crew i experienced and not interested in serving passengers the crew served drinks only once during the entire journey there was a choice of chicken or veg seeing that there were a lot of meals and that most passengers opted for the nonveg option i asked the staff to check if there is an extra vegetarian meal i wasnt able to eat in bahrain airport because of the delay and was rather hungry as i didnt have breakfast that day she said she will check but she never returned with one nor did she bother to come and tell me none were available after the lights were turned off the crew migrated to the business class section which so the economy class section was serviceless for almost half the journey the food on the first leg was nice but on the second leg night flight bah to blr on the 13th august arriving early morning on the 14th august it was below average
6529,cathay dragon,8,trip is actually nice,hong kong to shanghai pvg the trip is actually nice flight crews are friendly and nice the seats are comfortable but the space between each row is quite small which doesnt allow me to have enough space to stretch myself there are a lot of movies on the plane but not quite up to date about the meal the rice there is hard but the other is actually ok acceptable
17162,rwandair,4,worst airline i have ever flown,worst airline that i have ever flown not only did rwandair change my cape town flight to london flight to leaving a day earlier causing me extra expenses uk side and the management was incapable of grasping why i was upset on the flight the staff put on 1 film for the all the passengers and it started half way and on the connecting flight kigali to heathrow they put on the same film coffee had to be requested and seemed like a big deal to be provided at kigali we were bombarded with final calls for our connecting flight leaving in 40 min after the first stage landing bottlenecks at poorly staffed passport control and 5 yes 5 boarding pass checks truly added to the nerve jangling attempt to board but again no need to panic the flight left late in any case given 3 suppers meaning woken up again to eat some amorphous mulch awful cheap and nasty experience but actually not that cheap klm is a better deal pound for pound unless you enjoy stress that you are paying through your nose for
2795,air serbia,6,baggage fee was excessive,ljubljana to split via belgrade 50 euros baggage fee for 1 checked 10 kg bag was excessive also my last 3 messages to their facebook page about my flight were never replied to one part of my flight was 25 minutes late no explanation
10579,goair,1,sheer unprofessionalism from them,on 27th january 2021 i booked 6 tickets del to goi via bom which was scheduled at 0800 today despite doing the web checkin and printing the boarding passes i suddenly get to know that the flight has been cancelled and that too without any prior notification from go air i have travelled 500 kms with my wife and 4 years old daughter to catch the flight and now when i have reached delhi after travelling the entire night i get to know that the flight has been cancelled and that too when i proactively checked the same the worst part is that go air is refusing to make any sort of adjustment despite such behaviour i requested them to shift us in another flight which reaches goa at the same time but they denied to cater this request upfront we are also willing to travel separately in different flights but go air still did not agree go air is offering us to shift us in a flight that departs at 2000 and reaches goa at 0700 what am i suppose to do with my wife and 4 years old daughter for 24 hours you will be furious to know that go air has several flights from del to goi today but are still not willing to assist despite the blunder and sheer unprofessionalism from them
14811,monarch airlines,7,time to fit new seats,manchester to tenerife return on the outward flight the crew had to deal with a passenger falling ill after we had pushed back and were about to take off the crew appeared to deal with this efficiently with good communication on what was happening eventually the passenger had to be taken off the plane and we continued the journey the return journey was problem free on both legs the cabin crew were excellent and all aspects of the flights were good apart from seats when we have flown monarch in the past we have booked extra legroom seats but on this occasion we were unable to do so because all those seats were taken when we made the booking we were very surprised at how little legroom we had in the normal seats to make matters worse the seat cushions were very worn out we might as well have been sitting on the springs so come on monarch time to fit new seats we will be looking at the alternatives next time we fly
19650,tam airlines,6,basic transcontinental flight,a rather basic transcontinental flight with tam airlines from sao paulo to lima soon after take off a hot breakfast sandwich was served however after the meal service for the next 4 hours no drink rounds followed i was surprised that most anouncements where only done in portuguese and english and not in spanish apparently there was ife available but only on your own mobile device and after downloading an app before departure for an international connecting traveller this was not very handy
9420,finnair,6,worst food i ever had on airplane,they serve worst food i ever had on airplane little portion of something horrible looking also offering couple of options of soft drinks rest you have to purchase advice prepare your own meal to take with you
19731,tam airlines,8,tam airlines customer review,sclsaolhr 24 march lounge in scl is of lan hence excellent in all respects snack to sao not up to international standards but edible airports in brazil are all of low standards so not worth commenting on however as many others have reported the business class lounge in sao is really unacceptable it is well decorated with a good selection of snacks and drinks but only enough room for about 20 people sitting i had a 4 hour layover and found there wasnt enough space to even have a cup of coffee standing up it was unbearable with people standing in the reception blocking entry and exit it was the same as the situation outside in the public areas so no alternative but to squeeze into a corner and wait with lan channelling passengers through sao on routes to europe this problem must be resolved or alternative airlines will no doubt be used saolhr excellent inflight service with very attentive flight attendants and very good ife food was ok well presented but could be improved to lan standards to be fair tam fares are much cheaper than other airlines so we cant be too demanding ive used tam a lot within s america over the last year and will continue
7273,cityjet,5,cityjet customer review,lcybvelcy checkin and boarding at lcy quick and easy flight delayed 45 mins due to technical issue but kept informed avro jet in good condition with comfortable seats and just enough space crew charming and efficient return flight absolute chaos at brive airport considering it was the only flight departing you would have thought it would be a breeze no one manning check in eventually dealt with by a very ruffled checkin agent no one manning security for 30 minutes so just stood and waited when security finally opened they went completely ott everyone was frisked even though scanners not activated finally boarded 20 minutes after scheduled take off time to be told wed missed our slot and would be delayed by 90 minutes
8788,estonian air,3,estonian air customer review,cphtllcph cabin crew both ways showed no emotion or enthusiasm a very clever metal rod has been inserted in each seat which makes it extremely uncomfortable to sit in no complimentary products on these flights coffee purchased tasted poor creamer had no effect on the plus side checked baggage was delivered fast on both flights in the future will look for other alternatives
6229,buddha air,4,outrageous foreigner fares,kathmandu to biratnagar i have travelled regularly with this company particularly too and from biratnagar and nepalganj onboard and ground service is fine delays are frequent in nepal and this is not always the fault of the airline buddha uses relatively new planes which are comfortable inside although given the short length of most routes this is not really an issue checking in and baggage collection can be chaotic sometimes primarily due to the poor infrastructure at domestic airports the atr flights usually have allocated seats so when heading west ask for a right side window for mountain views or left side if heading east the smaller beachcraft used to fly to some smaller towns usually have no allocated seating if you want to be first on the plane make sure you are last on the transfer bus the primary problem is the outrageous fixed foreigner fares which can be up to 4 times more than for local people there are no discounts or promotional fares available even if you book months in advance as a result few foreign passengers travel by air in nepal unless they are on work related travel although some high end tourists usually on packages use the route to pokhara you can travel to malaysia or dubai in economy for the same price as a return ticket to nepalganj 35 min flight or fly business class to india sadly all the airlines in nepal fix these high fares operating as a cartel and i cant begin to imagine the damage this causes to the tourism sector particularly in getting people to visit new parts of nepal this appears unlikely to change in the near future so passengers be aware before planning your travels
21558,uzbekistan airways,1,worst airline ever,worst airline ever we traveled by this from st petersburg to tashkent that flight was good but the flight from tashkent to delhi number 421 was very old no screens on seats no pillows only child and women got pillows no blankets for all no wine or whisky not enough flight attendants worst ever experience
6110,british airways,5,found the food menu rather odd,why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt it cant be training who would do that it has to be no fear of anything happening the new club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there was one only main that i could handle and was then told they had ran out i was a few rows in
16970,royal brunei airlines,5,substandard business class service,we chose to fly royal brunei business class from melbourne to bangkok the first bad experience was the lounge in melbourne the maharajah lounge the food was old stale and cold absolutely disgusting having boarded the aircraft for the melbourne to brunei sector and being directed to our business class seat that was the only good thing about the flight the service was shocking the attention to detail by the unfriendly staff was surprising for a so called business class flight the food selection that was offered on the menu was unavailable and i had to settle for an economy meal that was inedible compared to food on other airlines that we have used the remote control on the entertainment system did not work properly the entertainment selection was extremely poor the staff were nowhere on seen throughout most the flight no offer of soft drinks or refreshments the only good thing was the legroom on the seat the last straw was the unfriendly way that we were asked to return the menu card given to us at the start of the flight rude staff who should be ashamed of themselves the 12 hour layover at brunei airport would have been extremely difficult had it not been for the staff in the sky lounge who helped arrange for a temporary transit visa so that we could stay in a hotel in brunei for a short stay in fairness the short second sector from brunei to bangkok was better the cabin staff were much more attentive and friendlier than our experience in the first sector overall this was a substandard business class service which did not represent good value for money sadly i will have to endure the return trip on this disappointing airline
6469,caribbean airlines,7,caribbean airlines customer review,posgeo on 32814 quick 50 minute flight from port of spain to georgetown check in ladies very friendly and fun boarding area not much to do one food shop near the gates plane came from miami and was a branded air jamaica plane 737 flight attendants well dressed and friendly boarding was quick and plane was about 70 full quick take off and serviced a snack and drink landing in georgetown was smooth and bags were delivered quickly overall a nice flight
16305,porter airlines,2,good days are over,toronto to washington the good days are over from a customer perspective ive been flying porter for years literally the day after they opened the torontowashington route in 2011 everything was fantastic until they reached a critical mass and they sold the airport to an external investor no more free coffee and snacks in the lounge overall service is terrible checkin staff is now just as indifferent as with any other major airline maybe also as a result of a looming first time strike as they protest bad management and disappearing benefits price and frequent flyer structure is far less attractive than it used to be dont get me wrong porter is not worse than any other north american airline but they used to be so much better in almost all areas and they are now just the same i used to feel special based on how they treated me even without their vip program now i have the same stupid cattle feeling as i have flying any other major airline growth and prosperity is certainly desirable and i saw how porter developed over the last few years unfortunately it has slowly followed the trend of most other carriers and i have no incentive anymore to choose porter its just too bad

2834,air seychelles,6,service very slow,on original check in at durban could check in baggage but saa could not print air seychelles boarding pass recheck in at johannesburg very slow with long queues although very pleasant staff aircraft showed lack of cosmetic maintenance despite being fairly new such as loose seat pockets decent legroom and a330 seating configuration 242 preferable to boeing service very slow after take off first hour spent handing out immigration forms food was good but drinks water or wine in tiny quantities with no offer of refill no walk around service after meal although call button was responded to reasonable flight but do not be taken in by creole experience punted on their website
302,aeroflot russian airlines,5,felt very rushed and unpolished,aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result positives included a seamless upgrade from comfort to business at lhr good plaza premium lounge very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio the a350 hard product is phenomenal especially on a short london route and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations usually poor hot meal however the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good however there are two drawbacks on aeroflot firstly i dislike aeroflots or svos standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in 6c and with ice covering the stairs i understand there maybe logistics issues but doing so to a premiumheavy flight like london and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic i am observing that the crew service on the a350 b777 is poorer than on their other planes it gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained as a result the service although efficient felt very rushed and unpolished i still believe that the aeroflot business class is above any of its european counterparts from the overall package size view and if one manages to upgrade for miles amazing redemption value like i often do then this product is possibly the best business class however fullfare paying passengers might be disappointed because in addition to a cuttingedge hard product for such money you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the just tick attitude overall is aeroflot a good airline yes is aeroflot a 5star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare no
15137,nok air,6,nok air customer review,phuket to bangkok don mueng aircraft old and not so clean a snack and water is offered with no option to choose between coffee coke or a juice 15 kgs free no delay staff as always professional and price little more expensive than lion air and cheaper than air asia impossible manage your booking via web site if book from an agency but is possible to check in 24 hours before departure if book from an agency will cost you 200 bahts extra but they have the possibility to choose the seat for you right away

14081,lufthansa,3,always an unpleasant experience,this is becoming a rule when i fly with lufthansa first the staff is very rude and even unfriendly second after we sit in the plane the pilot makes an announcement that something is wrong this time it was to tell us that we were stuck without being allowed to take off for several hours and also that they had not received any water so they could not serve us drinks last but not least we arrived but our luggage got stuck somewhere on the way actually this is becoming a rule now flying with lufthansa is always an unpleasant experience
8882,ethiopian airlines,9,would not hesitate to fly them again,checkin went smoothly and was opened 4 hours before the flight boarding was a relatively painless process and although masks were required a lot of passengers were not wearing them at the end of the flight the aircraft was clean although some of the ife screens stopped working see picture midflight the meal was a lot more tasty than it looks i opted for fish but options had ran out for the passengers at the back and they were left with just pasta i had a small bottles of euro wine which was probably undrinkable at ground level but was ok at 36000 feet we had fruit and a croissant for breakfast exiting the flight was slow largely because of the amount of hand baggage that was allowed overall it was goodvalue flight with some significant issues and the option of two 23kg bags for the basic economy price i have flown ethiopian several times in both business and economy and would not hesitate to do so again

20887,transavia,1,never again transavia,truly dramatic service and conditions never again transavia despite corona which prevented us from traveling to an area italy in october 2020 transavia refused to change or cancel the flight without charge this while that is simply a european obligation so rebooked with costs anyway unfortunately still corona april 2021 again transavia says that it is not possible to change a basic ticket moreover changes are not even possible on the site because additional taxes have come from costs that have to be paid again first the lady rattles on i cannot intervene without listening that due to corona the airlines have to give vouchers or money back

1099,air botswana,4,air botswana customer review,maunjohannesburg short 90 min flight on what appeared to be newer bae 146 interior had nice leather seats and the legroom seemed quite good for economy the flight attendants seemed indifferent almost as they were being bothered as they just plodded through the flight the only problem with the flight was the hot cabin i had to ask the flight attendant twice before the temperature was lowered to less than an inferno apparently on the bae 146 the cockpit controls the cabin temperature not the cabin crew

4490,arik air,3,inflight service is limited,abuja to lagos working in nigeria for the past year i have flown arik on numerous occasions between abuja and lagos and kano on the whole they delivered a pretty good service domestically by nigerian standards but from about november last year they ran into serious cash flow issues due to the drop in the value of the nigerian naira as a result flights became subject to regular cancellation and delay in january the airlne was take over by the nigerian government and now has a much reduced service arik has a number of regional routes around west africa which are well known for delays and cancellations but the same applies to most other regional airlines asky is probably the best owned by ethiopian they also fly or did fly to new york london and johannesburg but unless price is our only criteria flying arik long haul is an experience i wouldnt recommend inflight service is limited plans are old and tatty delays and cancellations frequent bags often never arrive
4408,ana all nippon airways,3,told i must pay a cancellation fee,ho chi minh city to seattle via tokyo after we were encouraged to book through their online website by vietnam staff to save money we were told by their staff in vietnam that our infant might be over the weight limit for their child bassinet at the time of flying we were told that we should buy another seat for infant to be safe after checking further their website i found that the weight restriction for infants in the bassinet is 10 kg i asked them to refund the tickets to which they told me i must pay a cancellation fee i suggested they could refund the ticket with no fee as i booked the ticket only 30 minutes ago they refused because i booked my ticket on the website i was automatically directed to i decided to deal with this and hope all would be ok finally flight day arrived and we had no baby bassinet and our seats had been moved from our reserved seats the agent at the checkin counted was very accommodating and did their best to block a seat for us so that my baby could lay down which was appreciated onboard i found the bathrooms ill equipped my food was average my seat seemed small entertainment weak and supplies seemed lacking for food and childcare the return flights were worse not receiving our originally reserved seats and the staff could not make time to help with our seating arrangement which meant an unhappy babys i wrote a review after my first flight and i havent received any feedback
2456,air namibia,9,air namibia customer review,windhoek to cape town just under 2 hours and were quite surprised checkin was quick and efficient although the lounge at windhoek is soso staff friendliness could be much better warmly welcomed onboard by the purser and were surprised to see business class seats with such a large pitch flight departed on time breakfast served was excellent and service throughout always with a smile

9987,flysafair,8,a very smooth flight,port elizabeth to johannesburg this was a very smooth flight from the beginning to the end more or less efficient boarding ground staff started boarding on time but asked holders of a priority boarding ticket to board from the end while most of them were seating in the front meanwhile all other passengers were boarding from the front apart from this issue everything was perfect everyone was on board on time and departure was 5 minutes ahead of schedule comfortable seats and friendly staff we landed 20min ahead of schedule i definitely recommend flysafair for its punctuality
5671,blue air,3,no free meals left,luton to larnaca it stated on the return tickets that free meals will be offered when we were onboard the flight and the meals arrived i called a cabin staff and showed our tickets stating clearly that we had 2 free meals they said we were not on the list and we continued to ask staff for the meal they said there were no free meals left to offer and we were not on the list i answered back that this was not my problem they finally offered us a coffee to shut us up
15801,pegasus airlines,2,there was no refund,i booked my flight back home on sunday as we have to work on monday after checkingin and dropping my bag i was informed that the flight was cancelled which is not the best news to hear of course there was a long line of passengers that does not move they wanted us to fly the next day an offer that normally i wont refuse however i had several meetings the day after that cannot be simply cancelled it feels like they are throwing us from one person to another with no respect i tried to find a reservation to a close airport however they cancelled all their trips to the north due to weather reasons there was no refund my bag still did not arrive after 2 months
9943,flysafair,1,ive always preferred flysafair but not anymore,ive always preferred flysafair but not anymore i needed to change my flight about 5 days prior but the system was down i kept calling daily asked a friend to do this for me at the airport but got absolutely no assistance on the day of departure at the boarding gate i was told that the gate closed a minute before i arrived and my bag was already offloaded so offloading my bag took a minute i suppose all this could have been avoided had i gotten help changing my flight the staff attitude is the worst im disappointed definitely hoping i never have to fly with them so much for the cheapest airline now i understand why its important to pay a little extra for an exceptional service
2941,air tahiti nui,7,air tahiti nui customer review,loved this airline except for one problem they changed our return flight from auckland so we had to layover for the night we did not appreciate this change it cost us a lot more money to stay in a hotel for one night in tahiti it made the trip much longer the flight to tahiti didnt get in until 945 pm and customs took forever then we had to be back to the airport by 6 am if they had to make this change they could have at least left earlier so we wouldnt have had such a long night
17413,s7 siberia airlines,3,s7 siberia airlines customer review,seating tight but expected on a low cost carrier departures and arrivals on time and in the case of the return to moscow we got in a bit early luggage arrived on both legs all in all a good experience
14752,mihin lanka,7,fly if good cost savings,26af being a lcc flight they served food and a packet juice they had options for meal upgrades that are payable liquor was available only for purchase smirnoff 50ml 2 jd 50ml 2 black label 50ml 4 beer can 2 crew is friendlier than sri lankan they seem to be hiring the people with the right attitude who are confident in conversing with passengers baggage compared to other lcc mihin is very generous in providing 30 7 mihin was in fact very generous to provide 50 7 from muscat to colombo promotion the overhead cabins were spacious as well cmbmct the crew served nonveg meals to passengers since they were short on veg meals checkin was very slow at the muscat airport i had to stand for 1hr 15mins in the queue to checkin soon after the checkin we had only 15 mins remaining to rush to the gates in colombo the checkin counter opened very late 130hrs before the flight and again didnt have enough time in the lounge inflight entertainment is not offered its very hard to travel for long hours without any entertainment during offpeak and if you book way in advance you can purchase a return ticket cheaper than oman air or emirates by around 208 omr80 lkr30k but during peak flying days the price can go up matching the fares on oman air or emirates only fly mihin lanka if there is gonna be a very good cost savings ratings are based on a lcc flight
22943,xiamen airlines,9,comfortable and clean,xiamen to guangzhou whilst it was an old aircraft it was very comfortable and clean the crew were lovely and for a short flight the food was very good the facilities at xiamen airport are mostly supplied by the airline and are first class
10253,garuda indonesia,1,another outstanding service,tokyo haneda to jakarta with my family on the 1145am on ga875 the check in area was very busy however mr kohdai the garuda ground handling manager was on hand to help and assist with his help we were checked in very quickly and then escorted through security immigration and into the lounge the lounge used by garuda at haneda is also used by other airlines therefore was very busy however we were able to find a place for us to sit together the food and drinks available in the lounge was adequate when time came for boarding the garuda ground support team were on hand to escort us to the plane at the plane we were greeted at the door by the cabin crew who provided us with a very warm welcome they certainly know how to treat their passengers and make you feel very welcome there was a very good selection of food and drinks available and the quality presentation and taste was excellent although the cabin was full the cabin crew kept coming around and offering warm and cold drinks together with snacks they even went out of their way to help and assist my two children with additional snacks through out the flight additionally on the flight garuda provides free onboard wi fi for the total duration of the flight and the speed of connection was quite impressive upon arrival in jakarta we were met at the plane door by the garuda ground service team who helped me and my family through immigration baggage collection and directly to the cars provided by garuda to take us to our accommodation another outstanding service from garuda cabin crew and ground support teams

13555,latam airlines,1,change the date and time of your flights,dont ever buy flexible ticket because will never be able to change the dates because their website give error always they change the date and time of your flights without explanation they dont have reachable customer service the arrival time to make the connection of flights are not compatible we had only 15 minutes to arrive there in madrid airport after taking a continental flight 10 hours flight the seats at the plane are too tight and we were not able and limit water in a continental flight

2622,air niugini,5,air niugini customer review,px4 bnepom 2912 refitted 767 dont know who designed and who signed off the new economy layout but there are serious flaws 2 toilets only for the whole of economy and they are situated mid cabin there is no void space around the toilets so any queue just forms in the aisles there is a seat right by the door to the toilet so this poor passenger cops the door opening and closing all flight plus the odour would be a nightmare seat on an overnight flight why is the latest technology entertainment system not gate to gate ive had is turned on anywhere between 5 and 25 mins after the seatbelt sign was switched off and then turned off at the started of decent 30 mins out result movie not finished service slow mechanical food quite good new seats ok for short flight but would be uncomfortable on longer haul too hard and seat base too short no under thigh support
275,aer lingus,6,there are some frills missing for a business class product,flew business class to jfk and return from dublin the seats are comfortable and good for sleeping the crew are very friendly the food is good but there are some frills missing for a business class product the menu is on a flimsy piece of paper no wine or drinks list is offered the table is not covered with a linen cloth as on most other airlines breakfast on the flight from jfk to dublin is awful and no choice is offered other than a terrible bacon roll awful coffee and freezing fruit plate this needs to be sorted as most passengers dont order dinner as they wish to sleep so a nicer breakfast would be much better in my opinion its a solid product but has room for improvement
945,air austral,5,air austral customer review,departed jorge newbury airport aep buenos aires to galeogig rio de janeiro flight number ar 2252 22 august 2012 embraer 190 aircraft arrived at the airport in time for a 950am departure there were many announcements in spanish but very few in english until english speaking passengers enquired at departure gates flight was 1 hour late with no explanation given flight itself was fantastic however cabin crew were less than friendly and did not even check our boarding pass to direct us to our assigned seat as we boarded inflight snack was some sort of carrot cake caramel filled biscuit covered in a white chocolate substance with a caramel sweet

4322,american eagle,3,service is extremely basic,flew american eagle from albuquerque los angeles and return i decided to pay the extra for first class because i wanted the sole seat 2a the seat is very comfortable and theres plenty of space the flight crews and cabin crews were great very friendly and helpful the service though is extremely basic no food only nuts chips and cookies it would be nice to offer the first class passengers some sandwiches at the very least the tickets are very expensive and there is nothing special about the on board fare the wifi on board is good but it is also not complimentary you have to pay again why not offer that for free to first class passengers on the ground in la i was told that i could not use the admirals lounge because it is not for first class domestic passengers again the ticket is very expensive and i dont understand why domestic first class cannot use the lounges dollars per mile i am sure that american makes more money on their domestic first class than on their international routes i had to extend my trip and when i changed my ticket i was charged an additional 35800 outrageous so my ticket ended up costing over 1200 i will think twice about flying with american when booking my next flight they only seem interested in making money and not customer satisfaction
4414,ana all nippon airways,5,service was superb,los angeles to haneda was fine and service was superb my return was not so good after takeoff the crew started to bring out towels and rice crackers they stopped at row 33 the row in front of me after a short wait the crew brought out drinks and came to give us i asked about the rice crackers crew apologized and started bringing rice crackers and drinks for dinner service we had a choice of set a or set b we both ordered set a and were given 1 for my wife and i was told have a 5 minute wait minutes later they started with icecream service and my wife asked about my dinner that they had forgotten after 10 minutes they brought to me but i refused every time i got up to use restroom i was asked if i wanted a drink which i said no
5400,bangkok airways,2,web site is misleading,vientiane to mumbai via bangkok we 2 travellers only chose this airline for the baggage allowance in spite of its long layover time their web site says 10 kgs extra as flyer bonus but the ground staff insisted it was 5 kgs only the information on their web site is misleading
4809,austrian airlines,6,expect more from star alliance,austrian is regular low cost airline on time performance friendly crew and relatively new aircraft reminded me lot of laudamotion which is another austrian low cost airlines overall i would expect more from star alliance and lufthansa group member
6918,china eastern airlines,7,certainly value for money,singapore to shanghai pudong return in december 2019 refurbished a330300 was used where business class seats were new with direct aisle access warm and kind service given by the crew better than many fivestar airlines the areas they should improve on is catering and ife meal standards are below average for business class with no western meal option the business and first class lounge at shanghai pudong airport was very nice but again with only chinese meal options ife was limited but acceptable for a fivehour flight overall though for the price i paid its certainly value for money

9554,firefly,5,firefly customer review,singapore to kuala lumpur subang took several round trip flights between singapore budget terminal and kuala lumpur subang in july on time flights new aircraft low fares with no extra charges for seating checked baggage or refreshments unlike on budget airlines in particular departing and arriving at kuala lumpur subang is very quick and much closer to petaling jaya and downtown kuala lumpur only quibbles are that the atr72 can be bumpy in turbulent weather and that the food muffin drink juice onboard are uninspiring try to get a seat at the rear of the aircraft as atr72s only have one door at the rear

17796,seaborne airlines,1,will never see us again,we bought tickets to travel to puerto rico from st thomas 81918 unfortunately the flight time was mixed up i call the seaborne agent and found out the next available flight had only one seat wish would have cost us 99 each to change our same day flight and we were catching a cruise so we had to be there for a certain time im certain she realize we will not make that flight and you would think good customer service would kick in and say if you dont make this flight we will cancel your reservation we bought tickets for 360 one way to puerto rico on cape air on our return trip 82618 gone to seaborne counter we had no flights call the agent again and got the same lady her explanation was we were no show so they cancelled our booking after i spoke to this same person before our trip she knew our situation and didnt even offer any instruction on the policy of the airline so i spent another 330 to get a ticket on jetblue to flight back to st thomas you would think she would try and assist me no instead she said it was 200 one way for her tickets a 25 booking fees to flight back to st thomas on seabourne this was a very expensive learning experience i lost over 1000 on a 300 trip your agent said to me i should have read the policy this airline will never see us again and i will never recommend
403,aerolineas argentinas,6,they tend to leave on time or early,one of the best things about ar is that they tend in my experience on 3 flights to leave on time or early boarding by zones is usually enforced and it works boarding starts early staff on board seem tired are never wellgroomed and generally bored friends other staff seem to be upgraded to business class regularly on board catering is very basic usually example breakfast flight of 35 hours leaving at 0510 served a cup of still water and a small health bar no options like other menu for sale items crew disappeared after service cabin baggage seems to have no item number control but is weighed rigorously free checked baggage allowance is 15kg unlike most other carriers throughout the world and carryon is 8kg this can be a trap for international guests who usually travel with around 23kg checked baggage allowance overweight is charged for on the spot
16488,qantaslink,6,qantaslink customer review,being the first time flying with qantaslink i was eager to see how standards compared with big brother qantas airport check in and security was all smooth through brisbane it was once i stepped on board that i noticed me and my colleague had the worst seats possible on the plane row 25 back row near the toilets and seats e and f which had no width and felt almost prison like in addition to this the boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew would recommend people sitting in rows 20 and forward to avoid this issue inflight services by cabin crew were excellent great breakfast options and drinks cabin crew were constantly looking to top up water no ife made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on considering we had read that ipads were offered on this aircraft i think for the money paid for these tickets some ife needs to be offered aircraft arrived slightly late which was confusing as we took off early but the delay was not an issue modern interior on board and as usual and great experience with qantas on their regional carrier qantaslink
15958,philippine airlines,2,overall service was lacking,the new a350 and a330 cabins were nice pal also offers decent food but overall service was lacking from ground experience to cabin crew and transfer i will not recommend anyone to fly with pal until they get their operations and training right our transit experience at mnl to mel was utterly unpleasant pals ground staff failed to communicate what is required of transit passengers in advance and made us go around in circles doing unnecessary processes and had a horrible surprise at the boarding gate when we were told that we need to go to another location to have our checkin bags opened up for inspection just before our flight it is also unacceptable that some crew on pr508 flying from sin to mnl on 8 june was sleeping on the premium economy seats even thought the cabin was empty pal once again changed our flight timing from mel to mnl on 18 june and changed the a330 from the refurbished cabin to their older product with a terrible 222 configuration with no ife on board and seats with different height what doesnt make sense is that they allocate me and my partner to sit separately across the aisle despite having the same booking the business class cabin is very full and we dont have any option to even select a side by side seat it is unacceptable for such arrangements by pal for their premium customers and undeserving 4 star airline rating
1514,air dolomiti,7,really impressed with the service,munich to sofia im really impressed with the service cabin crew friendly and responsive the aircraft embraer 190 was clean and with good legroom food and beverages were of a higher quality then those of lufhansa although it is a subsidiary would definitely recommend this airline

22297,vlm airlines,5,vlm airlines customer review,manlcyamslcyman what flying should be about great staff at checkins and onboard good food and coffee without having to pay for it and real cups too this airline that i had never previously heard of seems to believe in old fashioned good service at competitive prices and they make a profit so it can be done without penny pinching and charging extra for everything highly recommended
20899,transavia,7,has very reasonable prices,transavia has very reasonable prices for a direct flight without luggage and does no rip you off for the extra services the seats are perfectly acceptable the cabin is neat and clean and that i could notice there is no excursions from a security and safety standard the flight was on time on departure and arrival
16046,phuket air,1,phuket air customer review,we were booked on a flight with phuket airways to fly out on the 26th march with family about a month before we were due to fly we found this web site regarding the disasters that had already happened we have visited thailand several times and are not nervous passengers but upon reading the reports we tried to change airlines through our booking agent but were unable to because our original tickets were not transferable so we flew to bangkok as planned once we were on the plane we noticed that the overhead panneling was hanging down once we had taken off the passenger sitting underneath this was getting wet due to condensation they advised the cabin crew of the problem who got another member of staff who then proceeded to stuff the gap with paper and tried to seal the panel with some form of masking tape which did not work my overhead light did not work there was a blocked toilet where someone had put a disposable nappy down so eventually this toilet was taped off and out of use the passenger behind seat would not go into the upright position but because the plane was only half full he could sit in the seat next to him we eventually arrived in bangkok without any further incidences but not looking forward to our return flight we were on holiday for three weeks but some of the family were to return on the 8th april we proceeded our holiday and spent the last week in hong kong and were to return to bangkok on the 13th april for 3 days before flying back to the uk with phuket airways once we had boarded the plane at hong kong thai airways we picked up a complimentary newspaper bangkok post only to see the headlines phuket air woes leave 800 fuming after reading that the aircraft had not passed the safety inspections and the problems with the fuel and hydraulic systems and all but 2 planes were grounded made us very wary about flying home to the uk with them we made the decision that once we had landed at bangkok we would try to find an alternative airline to fly home with at our own exspense we eventually succeeded to find 2 seats with eva air 2 days earlier than planned but for peace of mind we were prepared to pay for the airline tickets although we had arranged our flights with another airline we were interested to see if phuket airlines were still going to fly to gatwick on the date we were due to fly with them once we were at bangkok airport we located phuket offices but they were closed our flight was the following day so when we arrived at the airport the next day we approached phuket offices and after waiting several minutes a member of staff appeared and we asked when was the next flight to gatwick only to be told they didnt know switched off the lights and locked the office we proceeded with our flight home safely with eva air only to speak to our family that had flown home with phuket air on the 8th april to hear that there had been uproar with a fellow passenger who insisted that they were assured that the aeroplane that were travelling back on was not the one that had had hydraulic problems previously he was assured by the captain that this was not the same plane but once on board the story changed and it was the same plane so all in all what a sham airline and the moral of the story is never to fly or recommend phuket airlines although we would not be surprised to hear that they had gone bankrupt
14550,malindo air,9,recommend this airline,hong kong to kuala lumpur i recommend this airline spacious seat clan aircraft flight was smooth and comfortable only one minus small portion of purchased meal
9799,flydubai,5,never fly with this airline again,i will never fly with this airline again seats are extremely uncomfortable definitely not enough staff as they had to run around the plane back and forward attending to people the entertainment are movies games and tv shows which are abundant and all of these are behind a paywall but i believe it is worth it overall not worth flying flydubai as even the cheap price cannot justify the poor flying experience that a person has

14981,nepal airlines,9,what a fantastic airline it turned out to be,kathmandu to delhi i flew nepal airlines as the national flag carrier of nepal was a bit apprehensive choosing this airline but what a fantastic airline it turned out to be flights were punctual priority boarding at all sectors attentive and smiling and also the inflight food was very tasty apart from the security checks at tia and immigration everything else was as good if not better comparing to some other 5 airlines i have flown give this airline a try and you will be pleasantly surprised
3703,airlink,4,overall this was a nightmare,understaffed and poor internal communications lost essential baggage for a short business trip i recently made a business trip to cape town for a conference one of my bags therefore contained marketing material rollup banners i checked these bags in in maputo they were treated as normal hold baggage i was advised that i needed to collect the bags in person at johannesburg airport and recheck them in for the leg to cape town upon arrival at johannesburg the bag containing the banners did not appear either at the carousel or the fragileoversized baggage counter when i attempted to make a baggage claim the sa airlink baggage claim desk was unstaffed i therefore had to pass through customs and look for another desk the transit desk was also unstaffed i reached the main ticket office which was fully staffed however the staff there would not assist me and sent me to a check in counter the staff at the check in counter tried to phone their colleagues in the baggage team however there was no answer as my connecting flight was due to board the staff member advised me to rush through security in order to reach the boarding gate she promised to try to find the bag i asked her for my claim number however she stated that i should send an email to report my claim i asked her why she herself could not send an email at which point she stated that she could not help me further since she did not have a computer as i boarded the flight i asked the gate staff if my bag had been found but she was not interested and just wanted to get people on board upon arrival in cape town again i tried to contact sa airlink staff to discover if the bag had been found however there were no sa airlink staff in the whole airport upon arrival at my hotel i received a call that the bag had been found in johannesburg and was probably at cape town airport however there were no staff there to confirm i was given a number to call early the next morning i called it multiple times however it never answered late in the morning i got through to a number in johannesburg where a staff member admitted that they were having difficulty contacting the cape town airport branch and promised to call me back on this day i had to attend the conference at which i needed to display the banners i ended up having to get alternative inferior quality banners printed up in cape town in order to use at the conference sa airlink only confirmed that the banners had been found at the end of the day when it was too late to be of use despite the fact that some of the hq staff i spoke to were pleasant and seemed to be trying to help overall this was a nightmare two things became clear a sa airlink save money by not having a full complement of staff at the airports this means that there is no one to assist the passenger in case of problems b the ground staff appear to be very unhappy and disgruntled if you have any problem at all they just dont want to hear about it the aircraft itself was clean and the onboard snacks were ok and the flights left nearly on time so really this airlines weak point is lack of ground staff poor attitude of ground staff and poor internal communications
12404,jetstar asia,8,great value for money,very decent airline great value for money and no real complaints if i had one complaint its more of the ground check in queues tend to be form very long since they wait until the last moment to check in from mnl on the flight back from sg the check in was fast since it was mostly machines but the gate or at least the access to the waiting area before the gate is closed until a few minutes before boarding in my case so everyone either had to awkwardly wait in the walkways before or just proceed there when it was almost time note as a budget carrier their gate is quite far from the shops and other waiting areas so it might be a problem going back and forth for older passengers
17497,sata air azores,9,great staff in flight,great staff in flight really nice with children ground service really friendly in lisbon pleasant flight with a lot of information during the flight
22383,volaris,1,horrible experience,delays are normal for this airline so you would think that they know how to handle such delays but they dont 9 out of 11 of their flights were delayed at mexico city only one person was handling a crowd of anxious people looking for information about their flights horrible experience i also had to spend the whole night trying to sleep on the floor because of a delay in monterrey
5307,bamboo airways,6,would prefer a low cost carrier,ho chi minh to danang we did not had to cue at check in because we were travelling with 2 toddlers unfortunately the check in staff could not retrieve one boarding pass in the system and we had to wait at the counter for 24 minutes 24 minutes for printing 5 boarding passes the flight was boarded by bus the bus was overcrowded and we had to wait long time in the heat for the last passenger to arrive a second bus would have been a good option the aircraft was clean the food was a piece of sandwich bread and inedible the drink choice was none everyone got a bottle of water i would prefer a low cost carrier where i can have the drink and food i like but pay for it instead of getting something for free you do not want the flight arrived one hour late
12453,jetstar asia,9,impressed with the cabin staff,penang to singapore flight 3k678 15 jan 2019 my wife and i were very impressed with the cabin staff and the help with me needing a wheelchair to the plane cabin staff very attentive and polite well done
18495,skywest airlines,4,skywest airlines customer review,perth to karratha on an f100 friendly staff from the ground staff through to the cabin crew onboard aircraft showing its age but the cabin service was efficient and friendly hot breakfast served with tea and coffee all included in the very cheap fare of 159 skywest has lots of positives going for it and whilst these flights are aimed mainly at the mining companies they will continue to pick up other business with their good product
22427,volotea,9,polite and helpful cabin crew,what i find pleasing about volotea is above aii the reasonably priced tickets coupled with the polite and helpful cabin crew makes this airline my first choice moreover allowing a small hand bag besides the cabin suitcase makes it easier to access my documents cell phone etc
12209,jetblue airways,2,misguided by the jetblue agent,i bought a jetblue return ticket with 50 lbs of checkin baggage to travel from atlanta and boston from june 05 to june 10 2023 i faced three main problems 1 after a few days of booking i was informed by jetblue that my direct flight had been canceled they also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from boston i contacted the jetblue helpline and requested to book another flight the only option for june 10 which wasnt direct rather boston to florida to atlanta 2 during the online boarding process on june 05 and 10 i had to choose a checkin baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if i had already paid for checkin baggage i followed the same process on my return flight from boston to atlanta but my credit card was charged 35 for my atlanta to boston trip after a few days when i looked at my credit card summary i contacted jetblue for a refund they said they would process my request in the next ten days but contacting jetblue support was a very frustrating process wait time was 45 minutes and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a jetblue crewmember 3 the most important and frustrating thing i experienced on june 10 when returning from boston to atlanta the good thing was that jetblue informed me that i must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in boston city therefore commuting to boston airport may take longer than usual my flight was scheduled for 345 pm therefore i left for the airport at 1200 pm but when i reached the airport i learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes the flight kept on delaying and finally i learned that i would not be able to catch my 2nd jetblue flight from florida to atlanta if i flew by the original flight from boston to florida i approached the jetblue helpdesk at boston airport after more than 90 minutes of waiting i talked to the help desk official he issued me a new direct ticket boston to atlanta for the next day upon asking they informed me that i could book a hotel for up to 250 i booked a hotel for an overnight stay in boston and spent around 240 i didnt eat dinner then i contacted jetblue and sent them the invoice after ten days i was informed by jetblue that i was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather why was i misguided by the jetblue agent that i was entitled to a 250 hotel as a graduate student 250 is a huge amount for me
3015,air transat,1,staff in toronto was absolutely tremendous,the air transat staff in toronto was absolutely tremendous helping with a mixup of golf bags upon our return from punta cana i mistakenly took the wrong bag and the staff did everything possible to ensure the bag i had taken got returned to its rightful owner and that i received my bag promptly and with the utmost care thank you to the air transat toronto staff you are terrific
8066,dragonair,7,dependable satisfactory service,connected to this flight to kolkata in hong kong a shuttle bus carried us to another terminal to board the plane through jetways plane departed and arrived on time inflight was cheerful and efficient ipads were provided it carried a much reduced version of the entertainment provided on cathay pacifics ushkg route port wine was served after dessert a small tub of haagen daz frozen as a stone on request newspapers were all in chinese i dont read the language and no amenities bag was provided also the inflight shopping selection was extremely limited of the five items i picked from the catalog only one was available lesson learned dont rely on duty free shopping in the air for buying your gifts cathay dragon is the only operator on this route and having flown over 20 times it provides a dependable satisfactory service
16184,pobeda airlines,7,read the rules and conditions,berlin tegel to moscow vnukovo the cheapest ticket doesnt include any checked luggage and only a small piece of hand luggage theres a possibility to buy checked luggage in advance but no such feature for hand luggage according to this a person travelling with for example a mediumsize backpack should drop it at checkin well its ok for a lcc to omit any luggage for the cheapest ticket but why not to let additionally buying an option for large hand luggage so if youre travelling with anything bigger than a purse its strongly recommended to buy an item of checked luggage in advance because at checkin desk this will be very costly online checkin is tedious with lots of advertising do you want to buy an insurance policy to assign a seat etc one needs to visit the checkin desk for dropping big hand luggage off for visa check so a very long queue occurred surprisingly but currently they dont coerce passengers to online checkin as it used to be some months ago its also free at checkin desk but they also accept mobile boarding passes tegel terminal c disorganized with enormous queues anywhere is a real nightmare but thats not pobedas fault they dont provide any meal service onboard one cannot buy anything even snacks some passengers complained on it only drinking water is served however the aircraft is new and tidy the seats are acceptable ryanairlike though not reclining the ground and cabin crew are polite and helpful as for me there were too much announcements especially about smoking prohibition this was repeated more than 5 times usually the flights are punctual but this time we had a small delay 30 min due to heavy traffic at vko i guess generally for such a price the product is absolutely acceptable the only recommendation before the flight read the rules and conditions carefully in order not to goof
10993,hong kong airlines,4,pathetic check in and ground service,pathetic check in and ground service at hong kong airport instead of reference they ask for a ticket number ok provided check in not allowed transferring through hong kong from another airline no problem ill go to the transfer counter they tell me transfer counter is only for cathay pacific i need to go through immigration and check back in aisle k so i run through the airport through immigration and customs back upstairs to check in get terrible attitude from the check in staff staff on the plane are very nice but come on guys get your stuff together or at least tell your passengers what to expect never again with hong kong airlines
17306,ryanair,1,this airline is awful,i always try to find the cheapest flight to wherever i need to go and it always ends up being with ryanair but i will say no matter what the price is this airline is awful the bag requirements for baggage under the seat is way too small my husband and i have fit numerous oversized bags under the seat perfectly fine but once in a while they will charge us almost 50 for the baggage that is way over priced for even what the app charges for an extra bag also again its ridiculous that i pack super light but they consider my bag too big just because its a hiking bag its hard finding other airlines to fly and ryanair is the most convenient one all the time but man do i hate flying with them also the staff when checking into the flight during boarding is always awful and so rude i feel like they just always want to look for trouble
14987,nepal airlines,8,food served was not upto standard,boeing 757 karnali from bangalore to kathmandu with nepal airlines the staff at the bangalore were ok the check in was smooth the flight was delayed by about 45 min the plane boeing 757 operated by our national carrier nepal airlines is probably 24 years old it looked old and the cabin was reflecting its age there were nothing for entertainment except for newspaper not even the airline magazine the food served was not upto the standard specially considering it was an international route the flight though was very smooth and landing was good
16642,ravn alaska,1,overall experience was fantastic,i flew on ravn alaska with my girlfriend back in february we flew from anchorage to homer and back with ease the flight was brief and enjoyable the staff were friendly and welcoming checkin a breeze boarding a breeze baggage pickup a breeze the overall experience was fantastic looking forward to flying with ravn again and taking in those unforgettable alaska sights
9364,fiji airways,8,crew was friendly welcoming,nadi to melbourne fiji airways was a pleasure to fly with the crew was friendly welcoming and made us feel like we were at home as it was only a short flight we had one meal which was okay for aeroplane food cabin was clean and the flight was smooth they have inflight entertainment on the boeing 737 although not state of the art it was drop screens every three rows but it would keep your kids occupied would definitely recommend fiji airways
11462,insel air,9,insel air customer review,miami to valencia venezuela with stops in curacao return i have to say that all flights departed on time service was good they served a small snack on the way to and from miami planes were md80s and looked a little old inside flight attendants were courteous and well dressed price was low 780 round trip which is the cheapest ive seen
9828,flydubai,2,one of the worst airlines,one of the worst airlines we were a family of 4 with 2 kids travelling from kolkata to dubai to connect to our next flight to zurich forget any kind of greetings or smiles they would run down the aisle fast without looking around as if to deliberately shove you back to your seat its a pity that emirates has them as a partner airline connecting the kolkata passengers to dubai the impression is so bad even with one single flight this was my first time ever with flydubai that i will altogether skip emirates bookings for the kolkatazurich segment from now on its not like we paid any less for the route they charged us the same peak december january rate as any other airline the aircraft looked like a cheap domestic carrier flying an international segment forget tv screens or anything fancy they didnt even have basic pouch bags in seats where we can keep our small items i wouldnt even comment on the seats quality it reclined like 2 and the leg space was just about there to fit in my legs and i am not even fat last but not the least once our kid strayed over to a more legspace seat one next to the emergency exits and prompt came the rude interjection please pay extra 200 usd if you want to use that seat
18262,singapore airlines,6,did not offer toiletries pack,we took sq285 sinakl on 6323 and sq282 aklsin on 19323 the service has dropped in comparison to our past experience on sia the world class hospitality as the latest tv advertisement claims is sadly missing the warmth friendliness cheerfulness the unique character and personality of singapore airlines was not there there were no disposable wet wipes provided when we boarded the plane the first meal took fairly long before it was served between meals crew would be walking up and down the aisle with water drinks and snacks but i did not see this on our return flight on sq282 the crew did offer a few rounds of orange juice and water but no snacks they did not offer toiletries pack whether i would recommend this airline depends on the price point at the time of booking in comparison to other airlines out there the whole experience felt like a very regular no fuss airline experience
20529,tibet airlines,8,would recommend tibet airlines,tibet airlines offered great service and comfortable seating with ample legroom chengdu to lijiang is a relatively short flight of 1 hour but crew were very accommodating they had inflight entertainment showing on screens in both english and chinese water only served on this flight but would recommend tibet airlines
1943,air india express,3,air india express customer review,took this flight because of convenient timing check in was smooth surprisingly they started boarding early more than 1 hour before flight time plane was only 3 minutes from the terminal we got to the plane and thee was no ac temperature outside was over 40 degrees celsius dubai in july passengers were getting very restless and children were crying due to heat they had us on the plane for a very long time and we ended up leaving late so more than 1 hour on the plane ac only went on properly 15 minutes after take off the aircraft was very very old and dirty flight was smooth and crew was friendly they need to use newer planes or reconsider people use this because of timing and nonstop route to pune i think if there were better option no one would go on it
2461,air namibia,6,air namibia customer review,windhoekfrankfurtwindhoek service ok but fas disappeared after dinner service even pressing the call button did nothing dinner was ok but the breakfast was embarrassing a dry bun with a piece of ham and lettuce or tuna mayo and yoghurt all around you saw people eating a few bites and leaving the rest seat was okay but ife was a joke for a 10 hour flight i would think you would have more of a choice than 1 movie played on 3 small screens in economy class i sat in row 22 which was 4 rows from the screen and even by squinting i still could not see it clearly must be a nightmare for families travelling with smaller kids i could have paid the same for a lufthansa flight from jburg with an additional r3000 for a return flight between windhoek and jburg will do that next time
19265,sun country airlines,9,attendants were friendly and helpful,my flights to and from san antonio to cancun were on time the flight attendants were friendly and helpful prices are low and i will be flying sun country airlines again
16885,royal air maroc,1,i really regret choosing royal moroccan airlines,i had no problem from nyc to casablanca i checked one bag and had a small carryon bag they gave me a red tag to place on the carryon saying carryon as i was going up the stairs to board the second plan from casablanca to cairo i was told that i have to check the bag since this is a smaller plane and there is no room for my bag i replied that the bag has medication that i need so i was asked to get it out i found myself opening the bag on the ground and going through my personal items not finding what i am looking for since it was dark at that point i felt so humiliated and told the crew that i will take my bag with me or i will not board the plane after a few minutes with heated loud voice debate i boarded the plane with my bag to find the plane having plenty of room to the point that my bag was the only bag in the overhead compartment i really regret choosing royal moroccan airlines and promised myself to share my story with everyone i know to avoid their services
6148,brussels airlines,6,experience was pretty average,on july 23rd i flew with brussels airlines from tel aviv ben gurion airport to brussels my flight experience was kind of average my ticket costed about 600 euros roundtrip which was pretty expansive for an only carryon luggage allowance ticket but it was my fault due to late purchase of the tickets if purchasing in advance i couldve saved 50 of the price of the tickets which is a pretty good price considering its not a lowcost airline well not exactly i had an early morning flight departing at approx 0500 am the flight was unofficially delayed it wasnt announced but it did occure it was a 30 minute delay caused by computers of the airport which shut down not the airlines fault we boarded rather quickly and took our seats i found the seats to be a bit narrow the staff on board was mostly friendly especially one flight attendant which her name i dont remember before takeoff when i panicked a bit due to safety reasons talked to me and made me feel safe and calm the other crew members werent that friendly average i would say after take off it was asked of passengers near the window to close their window shades and let everyone sleep so until 30 minutes before landing shades were off and everybody tried to take a nap fortunately i sat in an emergency isle seat which i booked in the online checkin for free and had some legroom i dont know how much legroom other passengers had but i imagine it wasnt as comfortable before landing a trolly passed for purchasing food and drinks i ordered a coffee which was dull and not tasty i think all airlines in the end serve bad coffee dont they overall my experience was pretty average not extraordinary good or bad i would say to sum up that brussels airlines is to be treated as a semilowcost airline they werent harsh on their policies but it is nothing like a traditional airline and it was felt i would fly brussels again if the fares would be attractive otherwise i wouldnt make a special attempt to book a flight with them
3697,airlink,9,it was a very pleasant experiences,i really enjoyed my flight the flight attendant was so lovely very friendly and helpful the flight was a breeze a bit of a rocky landing but in all it was a very pleasant experiences i flew early in the morning the breakfast snack i had the sliders were so delicious thank you airlink you never disappoint
1641,air europa,2,lack of professionalism,after being used to the overall good service and friendly attitude of the flight crew of air europa it was very disappointing to see the decay in both during the eight hours flight that departed miami at 1130pm we were served only one meal it was poor quality and only one choice no drinks except water was offered during dinner snacks and breakfast were excluded to prevent interaction between crew members and passengers due to covid however the interaction seemed unimportant for selling the same items such as sodas sandwiches and wine during the flight if costs need to be cut be upfront with customer and do not insult customers intelligence by offering lame excuses i understand new regulations must be enforced but flight attendants rudeness and lack of professionalism were highly unsuitable
4746,aurigny air,9,aurigny air customer review,travelling manchester to guernsey gy671 on 19 december 2012 the 1710 flight was delayed until the next day due to bad weather aurigny kept us informed arranged coach transport from and to airport to crowne plaza hotel with very good evening meal and breakfast next morning offered a drinks voucher at the airport as we could not take off until 1145

20164,thai lion air,1,charges for luggage are very high,i was flying from bali to mumbai via bangkok while checking luggage i was told that checkin is not allowed and i had to pay extra 220 for the same their charges for luggage are very high its totally unacceptable which airline charge checkin luggage wholly i will never recommend this airline and after paying so much you dont even get a glass of water you have to buy it totally disappointed and frustrated they purposely tell you about checkin baggage prices on last moment when you dont have any other option
14689,meridiana,4,meridiana customer review,linolb on aug 11th back on aug 23rd first time flying with them a kind of throw back to the 80s flight experience they had a sort of monopoly for flights to sardinia island before easyjet came in as a new player still very strong on this route onward leg on time but terrible seat pitch on the md82 the flight is short about 1hr otherwise it would have been painful the dedicated counter for baggage drop off was left unattended so only one queue in linate checkin procedures looked slower than i am used to with other airlines but luckily there were not so many people waiting for being registered return leg delayed 15 minutes again an old md82 with slightly better leg room staff were polite nothing more drinks were served quickly after take off ticket was expensive 300eur because of the peak of the holidays season easyjet was offering more or less the same rate but with lower baggage allowance and departing from mxp which is far away from my hometown not my favorite airline for sure but i will probably give them a second chance olbia costa smeralda airport is a brand new shiny and pleasant place this was the best part of my trip actually
6931,china eastern airlines,1,devastated and disappointed,sydney to rome via shanghai first of all i need to shame qantas for selling me this flight via their reward system as a platinum frequent flyer im deeply disappointed you associate yourself and expose your customer to this airline with subpar services we started the journey from sydney in a very small cramped economy seat if you are taller than 178cm and weight more than 80kg then you are going to feel squashed in their economy seats the staff barely speak any english and leave us stuck in our seats without water or liquids the inflight entertainment is subpar mostly asian films the food onboard was horrible absolutely inedible and tiny tiny portions no snacks offered during the flight china eastern airlines also didnt recognise my platinum status at the airport in shanghai and therefore i was not allowed lounge access to top things off they lost my luggage it never arrived in rome i had booked my luggage straight through from sydney to rome at the checkin desk and had my luggage receipt handy as proof apparently it will take at least 3 days to find my bag and no compensation offered i have no spare clothes toiletries or shoes i was just given a reference number and told to wait and hope qantas should not be associating with this airline and nobody who is expecting a decent flight with good service should ever fly china eastern im devastated and disappointed
9909,flysafair,7,his service was exemplary,big kudos to sandile at the check in counter at ort he went out of his way to welcome us he even helped us with our luggage his service was exemplary and made us feel super special even though we were traveling on economy class he is truly an asset to safair and clearly stands out in an otherwise customerunfriendly environment
16110,play,9,excellent price performer,excellent price performer reclinable seats new quiet aircraft reasonable baggage fees just dont go overweight no power must pay for snacks no app no inflight entertainment or power but thats fine for the price paid crew was friendly and efficient i would like to see an app for the airline for easier access to tickets
13603,laudamotion,5,flight went smoothly up to oslo,we had an early flight out of vienna we bought fast track cause we were not sure about how long the lines were and there were a lot of departures we arrived into the airport and long lines in front of security an officer opened up fast track for everybody but we were pretty lucky only around 10 people in front of us we left on time and the flight went smoothly up to oslo torp what i do not understand is why the crew is not interested in selling their products they said something about offers we did not hear and they went through the isle with their trolley we asked to buy a whiskey they had only brought perfume and cosmetics with them they said they should come back to us which they did not we asked him another time later and he said oh yes then still nothing and we landed without any whiskey we could not see they had not sold anything on their way down the isle
2727,air serbia,2,trying to get the money back,i paid for 2 extra suitcases online and was charged again at the airport my mum has been trying to get the money back for the past 2 weeks no email has been responded to she spend 30 eur on calls just to be told you will receive an email and the refund nothing happened
12265,jetblue airways,1,seem to be heading towards rock bottom,as a loyal customer for over 25 years i have been constantly discouraged by their services over the past recent years which seem to be heading towards rock bottom while i understand that times have been tough for many jetblue is the only company i interact with where its employees consistently have blatant attitude problems and clearly dont care about its customers im a laidback person and can deal with lost bags delayed flights and lessthanideal hubs but when its employees consistently seem angry and look down upon their clients i cannot help but use another service during my last trip there was a system malfunction that swapped my flight out and upon calling the service they were beyond unreasonable in lending assistance for an issue that was their fault in the first place another experience that has left me feeling disrespected and disappointed i am officially done with jetblue i hope this serves as a warning to others who may be considering their services stick with delta southwest american or even discount airlines such as spirit or frontier the staff is friendlier and helpful and their planes are fine if not better for many flights fyi the overall flight and employees are particularly bad flying from new york to fort lauderdale and new york to savannah
16493,qantaslink,8,qantaslink customer review,bundaberg to brisbane 8 august i was impressed by the friendly service for a 50 minute flight they offered a filling snack
19553,tway air,8,included checkin baggage of 15kg or 23kg,i had a 710pm flight tw171 and managed to check in at 3pm which is a plus since it meant that we could spend more time at the nice incheon airport although it was a budget airline they included checkin baggage of 15kg or 23kg depending on your fare rules and thats for total baggage not dependant on the number of bags not like other budget airlines that limits the baggage to 1 bag per person seatwise is atypical of budget airlines i didnt purchase any inflight food but i overheard that they only accept korean won via cash or korean credit card no inflight entertainment
6160,brussels airlines,6,staff were friendly,brussels airlines is very similar to austrian airlines slimline seats buy on board catering but having the benefit of flying to major cities anything else is just subpar staff were friendly and the food wasnt bad actually
1028,air berlin,7,very pleasantly surprised,took this overnight flight as a codeshare with etihad airways my partner and i chose to upgrade ourselves to the xl seats which is like the premium economy with an increased legroom and seat pitch compared to the normal economy seats for a price of eur77 very pleasantly surprised with the the entire journey new plane great cabin crew good entertainment and comfortable seats being at the front of the plane meant that there was ease in getting out and coming in and the xl seats around us were empty despite economy being full cabin crew offered to sell these seats to the economy passengers but only 1 was taken up seating arrangements were 242 and as soon as the plane took off my partner got to sit at the 4 empty rows next to us food was good but a little small overnight flight felt so short and a part of me wished it was a little longer so i could have a longer snooze all in all would recommend this airline to others and suggest upgrading to the xl seats
18063,silkair,7,choose this airline again,siem reap to singapore silkair free access to plaza premium lounge was good while waiting on rep airport which so crowded and stressful everything smooth during the flight and nothing to complain for this regional airline from sq definitely choose this airline again for routes thats only provided by them not sq

8880,ethiopian airlines,9,my experience with ethiopian airlines was excellent,overall my experience with ethiopian airlines was excellent the planes were modern and comfortable the flight attendants were courteous and the food was pretty good great inflight entertainment too price was a big factor in choosing them for my trip to london and back and as the cheapest option the value i received was exceptional i would 100 fly them again and intend to next time i make a trip with them as one of the available carriers
6570,cathay dragon,2,neither friendly or supportive,my flight from hanoi to hong kong was delayed one hour and i have asked the airline staff at noi bai airport that whether the delay would affect my connecting flight to johannesburg and she assured me 40 minutes was enough for connecting but when i arrived in hong kong staff of cathay dragon and the supervisor said i could not take my original flight to johannesburg offered me the next day flight 24 hours later or take indirect flights through other countries to johannesburg i refused to take indirect flights as it would take much longer time of flight and transit so i had no other choice rather than staying 24 hours waiting for the next day flight but the staff refused to provide me with a resting and shower facility while waiting 24 hours for the next flight they were quite rude in tone and body language did not apology for the delays and neither friendly or supportive rather than pushed me to accept to stay 24 hours in the airport with lounge service for food and coffee and without resting nor shower facilities no resting or sleeping place i could not sleep at all that night and felt really tired so next morning i went to the cathay dragon air counter to ask for a resting place it took almost 2 hours of discussions with her and the supervisor the supervisor repeated the same thing and refused to provide me with a resting and showering facilities and he sent his staff to go with me to find a public and free of charge resting place but we did not succeed as all these were occupied finally they offered me access to services in business lounge of cathay pacific where resting and shower facilities were available

6397,cape air,9,cape air customer review,mvybos had to book fairly last minute and the fare was pretty reasonable check in staff friendly and professional at marthas vineyard although you do have to jump on the scales as the aircraft is so small all passengers taken onto tarmac just before the flight and the pilot balances out the plane if youre lucky youll get to sit up front and make the most of the view unfortunately i am neither blonde nor female so i was out of luck on this occasion very quick hop over and bags out within 10 minutes great experience and extremely convenient
14887,montenegro airlines,3,montenegro airlines customer review,tivbeg return route the 3540 minute flight is quick and easy and landing in tiv can be spectacular flight crew seem efficient and reasonably friendly but it scarcely matters when the flight is so quick ditto the meal with which i seldom bother opting instead for juice or tea the airline is upgrading to new embraer jets which is a welcome event from tivat theyve also just expanded to service london lgw in addition to paris but the flight times are not hugely convenient it would be great if they could add more routes from tiv tgdfco flight which leaves midday friday and returns sunday night is brilliant
13038,korean air,9,i would fly with ke again,auckland to osaka via seoul the leg room was impressive i am 61 and can sit comfortably meal service was great crew was warm and with smiles the only thing is that the inflight entertainment system compare to cx and nz the choices of the movies were limited nevertheless i would fly with ke again for sure

6710,cebu pacific,3,worst experience with an airline,worst experience with an airline the flight was delayed and we were informed whilst that the aircraft has remarks which is a technical term layman cannot understand apparently there was something wrong with the aircraft which they tried to fix but they were unable to hence we had to use another plane my only concern is why was the plan only checked when we already boarded and currently in the coaster literally waiting to go in the plane if it was not safe to fly that specific plane wouldnt it be better to check it properly than rushing because the passengers are waiting why wait for an hour before deciding to change plane is it not possible to keep the passengers informed we had a 14 hours flight from london to manila and everything went smoothly i was expecting this manilalaoag 1hour flight to be hasslefree but it was the exact opposite we waited far longer than the flight time
3738,airnorth,7,airnorth customer review,darwin to kununurra in an e170 comfortable 2abreast seating and a smooth flight however there was a confusing beginning in darwin as the departures screen said go to gate but did not give a gate number eventually a barely audible last call announcement was made the service onboard was friendly a pack of two small muffins and orange juice was served the flight operated on time

2598,air niugini,5,flights were very nice,so we first had some trouble as the airline told us that we wouldnt be able to get our original flight but after some over the phone conversations with a very helpful woman in the air niugini base in cairns we were able to get on another flight which was a day earlier we were desperate to make it to honiara so we agreed to taking this flight although it meant staying overnight in port moresby before going to honiara on the original second leg of the journey the next day we arrived in port moresby a bit confused and unsure as the what was going to happen luckily we met a lovely woman who works for the air niugini airport team in port moresby airport she was incredibly helpful she sorted out our free overnight accommodation in the holiday inn which included two free meals and a very nice room and also shuttles to and from the airport she helped us get out some money and advised us on how much we would need she even helped us see the town because we wanted to have a look to see what was there so her friend showed us round in her car thank you the flights were very nice with tvs and food and drink served on a flight as short as two hours this was a plus but was unfortunate that we were delayed on the way there and that our flight got cancelled on the return journey

15181,norse atlantic airways,6,service is good if you know what you are getting into,this was my second time flying with norse between london and new york overall the service is good if you know what you are getting into it is a nofrills airline the ryanair of long haul you pay for a ticket and that is it if you want anything else eg bags pillow headphones you have to pay staff are friendly on board and the cabin was clean and comfortable both flights were extremely punctual some issues i found everyone has to check in at the airport regardless of whether you checked in online or not i assume this is so they can weigh and measure everyones cabin baggage 45 and see if they can charge 90 to put it in the hold as it is slightly too heavy or large this caused huge and unnecessary waiting times baggage took forever to arrive at lgw not sure whether this is the airlines fault or the airport but other reviews have mentioned it prepare to wait up to an hour after the border force marked up prices on everything 30 for food 4 for a coca cola
17195,rwandair,1,my luggage was misplaced,the food quality is not good enough seat inside aircraft with no comfort i arrived with no luggage my luggage was misplaced by the crew and they told me that we will deliver it after 23 days if i need it urgent then i need to collect with no compensation by company which lead to very disappointing situation this will be my last travel with rwandair

20045,thai airways,8,staff were fantastic and attentive,the previous flight out from lhr to bkk was ok but this return flight from bkk to lhr was a step up the staff were fantastic and attentive a menu was provided and the food in particular the duck with curry sauce was lovely we got 2 meals the cabin was dimmed after the meal to allow people to sleep this daytime route is always tricky in that you end up effectively having a 31 hour day the films werent particularly great although i found a couple to watch and there was nothing like live tv or sport which some airlines provide toilets were kept clean throughout the flight the hard product was ok full flat bed it pays to understand the alternate arrangement of seats close together or wide apart in the middle pair and aisle or window biased on the single outer seats its not the best out there but it isnt the worst either pricing is relatively expensive at the moment id say the eva hard product feels newer and fresher but the thai air staff work hard to level the field
3007,air transat,9,he helped me a lot,i want to write a review about the agent david ngoie from air transat he helped me a lot since i had to change the name on the flight i booked to match my daughters passport i tried with the third party i booked with flight hub and they wanted to charge me a big amount to do that even though this was only the next day to my booking i called air transat and the first agent i spoke with didnt even want to check and told me flight hub has to do it i called again and david answered and took the time to review my reservation and was able to do the change and sent me confirmation with no fee or any complications thank you so much david

18325,sky airline,1,stay away from sky you have been warned,i have to agree with previous reviewers that this is absolutely the worst airline i have ever dealt with no idea how they are able to stay in business i purchased the ticket for my friend from buenos aires to cancun roundtrip her flight was supposed to be yesterday afternoon they sent her an email in the morning saying that her flight was cancelled until today you are not able to call to talk to a human they only use texts during the texting they informed her that because her flight was cancelled that she would have to contact the third party that i purchased the ticket from to arrange the second leg of her flight from lima to buenos aires she called them travelgenio and they told her they had nothing to do with it now shes at the airport in cancun and theyre telling her in person that travelgenio changed her flight not them theyre refusing to look at the email that sky sent her if she gets to lima theyre telling her shell have to layover for 26 hours shes going to miss out on work and a family gathering and no fault of hers or mine whatsoever its a complete nightmare and communication break down stay away from sky you have been warned
10761,gulf air,3,avoid if you can,london to abu dhabi via bahrain the cabins are not cleaned properly i had biscuit crumbs on my seat belt and gum on the food tray from the previous passenger you are not given a menu card cabin crew pass by and ask if you want chicken or lamb if you are asleep or distracted while you watch your movie they simply walk past unless you wave to them on shorthaul flights you are given a cold chicken sandwich lack of coke is also unacceptable onboard entertainment system also seems lacklustre there are a handful of hollywood or bollywood movies and nothing else to watch the cabin crew hardly smile or want to talk to you significant overhaul is required avoid if you can
9918,flysafair,1,smooth efficient flight experiences,durban to cape town and return smooth efficient flight experiences both ways website worked well for purchase and checkin bag checkin only begins 2 hours before departure as a result the queue at the bag checkin counter for flight 161 was very long as safair has a number of flights departing durban in the late morning and noon hour was happy i had paid for priority standard service as the queue was very short for the priority desk checkin and bag drop both flights were completely full one huge plus for this airline is the seats cannot be reclined good decision safair snacks and beverages were offered for sale on both flights maybe it was my ears but the cabin of the 737800 seemed to me to be noisier than the cabin of the older 737400 we rode on coming back we struggled to hear the pilots announcements on the 800 but could understand the announcements with no problem on the 400 my daughter commented that the legroom on the 400 seemed to be greater than on the 800 both flights arrived and departed on time at both airports our bags were waiting for us on the carousel upon our arrival well definitely fly with this airline again

21609,uzbekistan airways,4,uzbekistan airways customer review,riga to tashkent then on to lahore and back this airlines routes are excellent food excellent with copious amounts service fine and nice to get different tasting beers than the usual fas fine once they trust you are not going to be another difficult passenger uzbekistan airways suffers from poor ground operations and officialdom at their airports which means that by the time people board the craft they are not always at their best this is taxing on cabin crew who respond with professionalism even if they are not the greatest smilers i understand uzbekistan airways are joining skyteam they are easily in the class of some other members of skyteam now so hopefully this will mean more good connections in an area of the world they serve well
7918,cubana airlines,5,cubana airlines customer review,just arrived home from a holiday in cuba flying with cubana airlines i sympathize with the people that had bad experiences but our flight was on time we upgraded to tropical class which was well worth it for gbp200 and had tons of room and good service granted the planes are old and russian but still have to adhere to the same safety requirements the inflight entertainment is terrible in fact its non existent but the food and drink were fine so take plenty of newspapers books and psp games for the kids cubans do things differently and the fine details are not perfect by any stretch so if possible i would choose a different and trusted airline if you have a standard you expect for example i was told tropical class was better than virgin premium which is just a lie
3718,airlink,9,attendants were efficient,johannesburg to bulawayo in zimbabwe on sa airlink seats were comfortable and a meal was served flight together with drinks on this 1 hour 20 minute flight flight attendants were efficient and pleasant this was a very nice trip

22263,vivacolombia,2,the lowest class of airline,lima to bogota and viva colombia is a low cost airline like no other that i have had the misfortune of travelling with taxes are not included in the ticket you pay this at the counter in cash dollars only to add to insult an eticket or boarding pass on your phone is not accepted it needs to be printed as expected the staff will refuse to help you with this they rudely suggested we have an hour to pay them find the money or find a way to print it ourselves or not be allowed on the flight we paid for they can print the pass for you at an extra 15 if you did not check the correct number of bags online thats an extra 15 so it comes to 30 again as mentioned lets not forget the taxes you need to pay in cash at the counter so that makes it 45 extra all in all it then becomes the same price as flying on a national carrier on the flight itself its first come first serve in terms of seating as with most low cost carriers however being a late night flight one would expect the lights to be dimmed or turned off at some point so some people could rest a little this was not the case at anypoint hence few were able to sleep in terms of the emergency exit they only allowed one person to sit next to each one in my humble opinion that defeats the point of safety if people are far away from the exit it takes longer to escape in the unlikely event of an emergency in terms of emergency at no point was their ever any briefing given by the cabin crew i give this an overall very negative review and easily say it the lowest class of airline ive ever travelled with
8056,dniproavia,7,dniproavia customer review,kievsimferopolkievlviv the first two legs operated by b737 were pleasant apart from the seats being a little cramped snacks served staff were efficient and flights operated on time note that dniproavia does not check luggage through on connecting flights or issue onward boarding passes you must collect your baggage at kiev and check in again the final leg to lviv was operated by wind rose md82 a snack with wine was served again the seating was a bit cramped but no complaints on this short flight
5458,batik air,3,worst airline ive ever used,the worst airline ive ever used staff have problem with everything what the passengers need once food is in the price of ticket once you must paid extra nobody ask you if you need something to drink or if you want a food you must buy a water and everything definitely last flight with batik air
11701,ita airways,2,flights were a chaotic affair,ill start with only positive airplane from rome to san francisco was clean and comfortable cons 1 from new delhi to rome the aircraft was clean but old and the entertainment system was terrible seats were just ok 2 food was terrible the worst ive ever had on any international flights and ive flown many food served in these flights was tasteless and inadequate 3 lost baggage me and several co passengers has missing baggage and i am still waiting to hear from airline 4 both my flights were delayed 5 boarding process was completely missing and boarding on both the flights were a chaotic affair
1951,air india express,6,air india express customer review,dxbpnqdxb check in was smooth at dxb t2 and i managed to get 1c the plane from the inside looked a bit shabby as most ai aircraft somehow do but i was happy for the extra legroom for my 63 frame a very overweight couple took seats 1a and b after smiling sheepishly at me the man was overflowing into my seat i saw that 1d was empty and moved over aix served a flimsy cardboard box containing a sandwich a small packet of banana chips something fried and inedible and a muffin strange assortment but better than nothing and welcome on a low cost carrier unlimited water as well drinks are chargeable flight left about 30 minutes late but arriving into pnq was a breeze and i was home in 10 minutes after leaving the airport checkin in pnq for the return leg was chaotic as usual and the woman insisted my bags were overweight i smiled a lot and finally after i removed my laptop from my hand luggage she let me go through and even gave me a reclining exit row seat the seat bottom was worn out and the metal bar kept poking my rear when i asked for a blanket even a used blanket i was told they had run out of them i avoided serious long term damage to my tailbone by moving and shifting through the flight same food was served on this leg overall it was good value for money but basic maintenance a word missing in indias lexicon could be better sitting on metal for 3 hours is no fun
21539,utair aviation,8,utair aviation customer review,i returned this week from tyumen to munich another b735 this time with vintage business cabin and seats as i was alone in the section i missed the europeanstyle seats that would have allowed me to completely lie down instead of sitting with a 135 recline crew were smiling and helping with more polyglot aptitudes than during my preceding flight excellent tasty lunch with sardinian i checked red wine takeoff and landing right on time i shall not hesitate to fly with utair again
7853,cubana airlines,5,staff was very rude,toronto to cayo coco return we returned from cuba to toronto on february 19 leaving 1135 from cuba staff was very rude it seems like they didnt care we asked for tea and they brought the tea we then asked for milk and sugar and she even didnt acknowledge this not even the second time
16486,qantaslink,9,pleasure flying with qantaslink,travelled qantaslink from brisbane to townsville via mackay ticket was 45 cheaper than direct flight due to qantaslink sale flights were on time and uneventful small snacks with tea and coffee or soft drinks staff were attentive aircraft clean leg room okay i have flown this routing a few times and each time my bag appears on the carousel in mackay when its checked through to townsville i always go out and recheck it at mackay and there is never a problem but may catch travellers connecting at mackay by surprise so always check for your bag at the baggage carousel and recheck your bag if you see it otherwise a pleasure flying with qantaslink
18511,smartavia,2,no leg room and super hard seats,they use a scam payment system for cabin luggage if it doesnt fit into the tiny box half of the normal size you pay 25 at checkin but at another mandatory check during boarding its already 40 impossible to check in online unless paying for the seat no leg room and super hard seats
12796,kenya airways,1,a shocking experience,flying from lusaka to london via nairobi last month with kenya airways was a shocking experience predeparture tests are no longer needed upon arrival to england however my instinct told me to check if i needed a pcr to transit through kenya the covid information on the kenya airways website is extremely misleading when i filled in all the details about my trip it said nothing about a pcr test however when i spoke to an agent on whatsapp they said i need a pcr test as i am not vaccinated screenshots attached having to rush around lusaka the day before i flew to london i eventually got a pcr test i arrived at lusaka airport at 2330 on sunday and did not get my bags checked in until 0110 on monday 5 minutes before baggage drop off closes due to the airline and staffs poor customs i knew my bags were overweight and decided to pay the additional cost rather than repack i was told that i cannot pay using card and can only pay in kwacha or us dollar i had 100 which was roughly the additional cost and it took over 45 minutes for the staff to find out whether i could pay using british pounds and inform me the atm i was advised to go to outside on the bottom floor of the airport was out of service and i had to run to the domestic airport 10 minutes from the international airport if youre in shape to withdraw cash from the second nearest atm the total amount was 2066 kwacha and when i presented 2100 kwacha i was told they did not have any change if you are travelling to southern africa ethiopian airlines is a much better airline and i can see why more people prefer them over kenya airways
20999,tui airways,8,overall good standard service,bristol to naples tui airways offer an overall good standard service both outbound and inbound flights were on time and the staff onboard were courteous and professional the seats and inflight service are in line with other shorthaul flights and budget airlines was perfectly acceptable for a 3 hour flight the only downside was ground crew which were not tui airways being a bit slow with the delivery of luggage but that is partly due to the summer peak season they are primarily geared up for passengers flying as part of a tuifirst choice package holiday which means the fares are not great value but since it was the only airline offering this route i was happy to fly with them and would consider doing so again
19657,tam airlines,6,bland and mundane experience,3 flights with tam airlines from rio de janero to asuncion paraguay via buenos aires which over the eight years ive flown with them has become a pretty bland and mundane experience inflight programe repetative pranks show only kidding which becomes tedious and boring the dated cream and red cabins look grubby and the downgraded meal service and reductions of bar service leave it an airline of neccessity not preference best i can say is flights on time and cabin crew of the paraguayan sector pz far more agreeable pz planes definately dated and tired and despite a new and glossy terminal at gru you are still being bused to and from pz flights long haul lhr asu booked for may so lets see how good the magic red carpet experience will be then
185,aegean airlines,7,nothing to complain about,nothing to complain about stuttgart to heraklioncrete on sept 21st and return on oct 1st we booked aegean for the convenient flight times and their decent luggage policy in the eco comfortflex fare both flights were 100 on time checkin procedures were quick and efficient due to the chaotic conditions at heraklion airport aegeans punctuality and efficiency cannot be appreciated enough flight was ok the crew was not overly motivated but helpful and friendly there was a free snack and beverage service which was nothing special but more than other airlines offer interior of plane was a little run down but seat comfort and leg space were ok overall the eco comfort flex fare is a very good value for money too bad aegean doesnt offer a business class on their her flights at least not out of str
20841,transavia,5,a bad experience,flight delayed for almost one hour plane dirty flight full and flight attendants couldnt care less so a bad experience
3182,airasia,1,never again for me,although having checked in online for the baggage drop off you are being referred to kiosk machine to print your own luggage tag however most of these kiosks are out of order or suddenly run into an error while processing your request after addressing this to the staff youre just referred back to the kiosk and after insisting it wont work finally being referred to a counter to drop off your luggage at waiting your turn at the counter the completely uninterested ground staff member simple wanted to refer me back to the kiosk again even after ive stated it didnt work when i insisted she mentioned her counter was for checking inn cabin crew only it was clearly she was lying as other passengers were checked by her before in the end i got another staff member involved who told the lady behind the counter to actually assist me after which my bag was checked in smoothly within 3 minutes in the meantime many agitated passengers encountered the same frustrating experience i truly dont understand why an airline would tolerate such rude and indifferent behavior ive filled a complaint with airasia about this but i only received an automated answer and the day after an email saying my case was closed with no information given or anything flying with airasia never again for me
10430,germanwings,7,germanwings customer review,flight from vienna to cologne viecgn on the standard a319 airbus using the smart price class level my wife and myself had comfortable seats and legroom for this trip of 1h10min the snack box offered and its contents are just poor the only reason for paying the surcharge called smart price is preselected seating and one piece of checked in luggage the general quality of service is acceptable friendly crew efficient service clean planes plus the feeling of safetysecurity you buy in a plane of the lufthansa group but do not forget it is still a low cost flight as a long time lufthansa frequent traveller i will never get accustomed to the fact that they try to charge 490 for a wine no passenger bought any alcoholic beverage
18406,sky express airlines,9,whole experience was wonderful,this was my first flight with sky express the whole experience was wonderful the staff were friendly the aircraft clean and tidy and all on time highly recommended
10473,go first,2,book only if youre ready for reschedule,book a ticket with this airline only if you are ready for reschedule they will make sure it gets rescheduled and most of the time with any announcement
20998,tui airways,2,never book with tui ever again,aberdeen to corfu return temp was too cold snack choice was rubbish even though we had a disabled child and made this clear at booking we were still at a and b seats so had to sit with another person not in our party on the isle seat meaning that every time my daughter needed the toilet or anything we had to ask the man to move he was very impatient and by the time we were on a return flight we were forced to move seats sitting separately really late boarding by over 15 hours departure area is terrible at corfu airport so very very uncomfortable there and there is no airport lounge food very expensive arrivrd back at aberdeen in the early hours too late to drive home so had to spend night at airport airline staff ok but not very friendly or helpful didnt listen to what was ordered would never book with tui ever again
14777,monarch airlines,5,service described as bordering on rude,the flight was ok the landing smooth but the service can be described as bordering on rude one lady at airport in porto oporto flight portoluton was simply rude she saw i had two bags half empty already prepared for having one over my head and another in front of my seat she not only made me put one bag into another before getting on the plane but she also told me off for that and changed the shape of the gate excluding me from the queue when i was at the very front also on my way to porto i wanted to ask a flight attendent if i could order some hot food so she could put it in oven it takes some time to prepare and she answered in a rather rude way that they dont serve at that stage however the pilots were very nice im not really sure why but i would still recommend the airline
9077,eurowings,5,they forced all people to stand in a small area,flight on time for a short 1 hour flight okay only drawback they forced all people to stand in a small area and wait for an hour i refused to do so because this spot was fully overcrowded finally they let me nobody understood this the other thing is that you now have to buy hand luggage like on ryanair
21249,turkish airlines,3,wouldnt recommend flying with them,1 my original flight was from sfo to bom via ist and i caught covid 1 day before the flight i called turkish airlines multiple times to let them know if the same and that i needed to change my reservation they told me to submit a feedback and after waiting for over a month and over 100 calls to turkish airlines i never got the flight rescheduled not i got full refund through them turkish airlines website says that they offer full refund due to covid i had initially uploaded all the documentation pcr tests passports etc 2 i eventually made another flight reservation through tk website and at the destination my bags were lost by turkish airlines my bags were checked through to the destination i received my bags after several phone calls to bom airport and more than 24 hours later i received 0 as compensation from turkish airlines 3 i had flown business class throughout and tk as part of milessmiles only gave me economy miles when i submitted another feedback form to claim miles for my business class paid upgrades they denied and said they only give miles for the original paid ticket i wouldnt recommend flying with them they have bad customer service
8891,ethiopian airlines,4,giving priority to its employees over passengers,having flown on ethiopian airlines number of times before i knew what to expect it was a pleasant surprise to discover that the a350 had its latest business seats which were fairly standard although hiding the remote control in a cupboard did not seem to make much sense as i arrived despite only half the seats being occupied at that point all of the overhead bins occupied and many of them were larger than the size the airline allows i asked one of the cabin crew what was happening and she conceded very apologetically that all of the bags belonged to crew members i managed to squeeze my bag next to an oversized pilots case there seem to be at least five pilots occupying seats largely at the front of the business cabin which of course meant that they were served food and drink first if ethiopian airlines wants to achieve reputation for being the best airline in africa then it should try to emulate best practice and seemingly giving priority to its employees over passengers who had paid a significant amount of money to fly business class is not the best way of doing this the cabin crew seemed embarrassed but clearly did not feel able to challenge their pilots other than this irritation the flight was smooth the service efficient the seats comfortable and both getting on and off the aircraft went smoothly
978,air bagan,7,air bagan customer review,yangonbagan atr72 decent plane old and tired but as youd expect from an airline in burma there was 1 cabin crew member and the copilot very pleasant service and a nice cheese croissant for the flight completely empty so you could stretch out over two seats which is important for me being 6ft 3
20357,thomas cook airlines,4,like long haul ryanair,manchester to new york jfk return this was the most stressful outbound flight experience i have had i arrived over 2 hours early for my flight to ny and was greeted by absolute chaos in the manchester check in area enormous queues of passengers just not moving and angry priority passengers yelling at staff as normal queues were moving faster than them eventually they opened more desks and things got moving but it was nearly an hour by the time i got to check in outbound my hand luggage was 8kg so 2kg over the 6kg luggage allowance which i hadnt realised as i booked the flight the day before for a surprise visit my fianc had planned most other airlines have a 10kg hand luggage allowance so the 6kg is unreasonably restrictive imo and is clearly not a safety thing as premium passengers are allowed 10kg as we were only going for the weekend i had packed a trolley case with very little inside and since my partner lives in the states i took the chance to use my baggage allowance to pack some items we had not yet been able to take out there like bedding etc which was in a sealed box the guy on the desk was adamant i had to lose 2kgs or pay 95 to check in my hand baggage i asked if i could pay per kilo i was overweight as i had no way to repack the sealed box and could not afford to pay the extortionate checkin fee which is higher than additional baggage charges i have paid on other airlines when i genuinely have had to check a bag in he was rudely adamant no so i relented and said well if i had to transfer into my checked bag which was only 15kg then i needed scissors and tape to open and reseal the box not his problem apparently and i was told i had to find somewhere else in the terminal to do it or pay the 95 long story short the baggage storage counter was nice enough to let me use their stuff but i think the rudeness and disorganisation of the staff and stingy inflexible and ridiculously expensive baggage policy is enough to put off flying with them again by the time i got my bag checked the flight was boarding and i had to run through security to get to the gate had the same enormous checkin queue issue at jfk on the return leg where the queue at 7pm for a 10pm flight was so large they had a separate side queue area before you got to the queues at the front of the desks credit to the 5 desk staff there though it did move reasonably quickly my inflight experience was supposedly better than normal due to them issuing a free upgrade to premium entertainment which was frankly poor in comparison with other airlines ive recently flown to usa with delta icelandair on the return i had 5 films to choose from food was ok but no complimentary drinks except a bottle of water and trolley drinks are expensive there was a constant push to sell you stuff you have to sit through 4 adverts back to back before you can watch anything it really is like long haul ryanair but with a stricter baggage policy it took an hour after landing for my bag to come into reclaim so having got through immigration that was a 40minute wait meaning i missed a train connection by 2mins the gate from jfk also had no seats and we had to be bussed out across to the plane which was miles away in summary a totally budget experience which could be so much better if they could sort out check in and be slightly more reasonable on hand luggage weight allowance
6167,brussels airlines,8,i recommend brussels airlines,i recommend brussels airlines the food and entertainment on board might not be the best in the market but the companys staff is amazing and willing to fly the extra mile to fulfill customers needs
13076,kulula,3,my seat had been changed,cape town to johannesburg our flight was operated by comair therefore this needs to be taken into consideration regarding the following review after 2 hours of delayed takeoff standing at the gate the clerk tells me my seat had been changed usually one couldnt do much i guess but this time i specifically paid for a seat in the front section in order to leave early upon landing everyone was stressed an i didnt want to fuss too much around so they gave me a number to call later to get my refund great they give me the job to arrange my refund the next day i call they tell me a story i have to write an email etc its a typical situation where the customer gets pushed around wasting time to get his rightful refund for a service not provided i thought instead of writing them an email with all the details i thought it would be better to go public about this and warn against their paid seat service
17869,shanghai airlines,1,comfortable seats,flew shanghai airlines from phuket to shanghai pudong on a new boeing 737800 on an overnight flight best economy class experience very clean and new plane comfortable seats with lots of leg room very good and tasty food i would fly shanghai airlines again
682,air algerie,1,service is very bad,algiers to montreal the service is very bad actually there is nobody to whom to talk my flight was supposed to be on tuesday at 1240 but we flight at 1830 cause a strike the food was inedible i missed my connection in montreal to toronto knowing i bought my ticket 160 and for sure no one from air algerie in montreal to receive us i spent the night in the airport i will never ever take this company again
14807,monarch airlines,6,extra legroom seats 32 euros each,gatwick to faro return having flown monarch many times and not had a problem we were surprised to be delayed firstly when boarding and then again whilst waiting for our slot not only that but upon arrival at faro an ambulance arrived to take a disabled person off the back instead of opening the front and letting us all go out that way we had to sit yet again why coming back from faro we were shocked to be told that extra legroom seats were 32 euros each we declined but were happy to find that our return flight was on a new plane with the slimmer seats this means there is extra legroom anyway i would be interested to know why they dont restock with sandwiches for the return leg we had our own food but there were a lot of unhappy golfers on board because there were no sandwiches to be had at all
13328,lan airlines,3,lan airlines customer review,the plane was late both ways from cusco to lima and return also we were at the airport for over 5 hours and we missed connecting with our party to take the tour which cost us additional money they had a flight to cusco which was scheduled to leave after our flight but they did not put us on it no reason given you are never told when you will be able to leave they leave you waiting without any communication
15602,onur air,6,onur air customer review,flew back from northern cyprus overall the flight was very good apart from a very bumpy landing generally the flight was good with friendly staff average free food and soft drinks

21987,vistara,8,the experience was amazing,this is not the first time i have flown vistara and the experience was amazing the checkin was pretty quick on board service was excellent and the staff was polite the flight was on time in spite of a short flight they still served good snacks the seat was also better than most airlines i have flown and the plane was clean and hygienic i will fly with them again
6095,british airways,2,overall not a good airline,food was lousy who ever is planning the asian hindu vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes the snack was also lousy it took us 2 hours just to go from t5 to t3 and clear security check the place was chaotic we get to our boarding gate and again a long line with 40 minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass seats in premium economy was ok but when the passenger in front reclines there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over overall not a good airline
9550,firefly,2,firefly customer review,return subang to penang outward leg fine punctual and efficient but the next day i received a phone call from firefly to say may return flight to subang had been cancelled because of technical problems but they could put me on an earlier to which i agreed i arrived at penang airport to find the earlier flight was actually an mas flight to klia in fairness they paid for a taxi from klia to subang to enable me to collect my car but beware as it is apparently common for firefly to cancel flights when they have a poor load factor this information came from a member of their staff
15369,olympic air,8,crew service was excellent,olympic air takes most of the flights within the greece even though the flight was very short around 30 minutes crew service was excellent the weather was bad severe turbulence and the steward was outstanding he manages to calm us down even though the flight was not very pleasant due to the bad weather the plane was the one with propellers which was a little loud but it is fun due to the bad weather they did not any snacks or drinks but we did not care we just wanted to land in one piece the view from the plane was marvellous while we were landing the nature in greece is wonderful and overall we were very satisfied with the service of olympic air
3675,airlink,8,customer service skills were fantastic,eric scholts customer service agent deserves a medal i was travelling from windhoek to johannesburg with a group of 25 people we had a connecting flight to paris with a 3 hour lay over and my checked back was set to stop in johannesburg instead of continuing to paris causing the potential risk of missing my flight thankfully i was able get assistance from eric who escorted me through an airport ive never been to before to ensure i made my next flight on time he explained each of the checkpoints i had to go through to get to my gate his communication and customer service skills were fantastic i had trouble through airlink with my itinerary the night prior but im grateful i was able to get assistance this man gets a 1010 but the airline overall with the troubles i had the day prior get a 610 so overall 810
14498,malaysia airlines,4,meal quality has dropped,after 3 years absence due to pandemic restrictions also as an enrich gold member i was very much looking forward to flying with malaysia airlines again it was a return trip from bangkok to kuala lumpur my high hopes were completely crushed after the 2 flights my review would be too long if i had to write about everything so i just simply summed up what were most disappointing to me state of the aircraft is old and poorly maintained crew service was not consistent some good but some were very subpar meal quality has dropped to a dangerously low level with tiny portion barely the size of my mobile phone screen served on a cardboard box with just a packet of peanuts and a small bottle water came also with cheap filmy plastic cutlery reminiscent of budget airlines not ok for a premium airlines like this new safety video featuring silly dancing and singing with little regards to conveying the message if safety in short it shows that they are in financial difficulties and also lost directions and survival strategies once it was possible to use mileage to upgrade but they removed that feature plus introducing new pricing system and fees for this and that i used to favor this airlines before the pandemic hit in 2020 after these flights i see less and less reasons to remain loyal i will seriously consider shifting my business and loyalty elsewhere after i have used up all my mileage with them
20346,thomas cook airlines,2,airline ill never fly again,gatwick to cancun 1 hour delay extra suitcase charges are extortionate up to usd185 for extra 20kg if paid on the day 50 discount if paid before they only allow 6kg hand luggage probably the most uncomfortable long haul flight seats ive sat on poor foodmeal and you have to pay for all drinks during the flight including soft drinks there was no option to upgrade to business class and have a more comfy seat premium class are next to emergency exits and only give you extra leg room at face value it seems like a cheap flight option but the reality it isnt and is an airline ill never fly with again
1331,air canada rouge,5,very cheap service,flight 1852 august 22 las vegas to toronto very cheap service no coffee or tea with the air canada stocks doing so well the company should invest more in customer satisfaction no space for luggage on plane even though it meets the requirements
15426,oman air,6,the whole flight it was really hot,we travelled to muscat from manila philippines last july 21 2023 via wy 844 me and my husband have an infant and a 2year old kid travelling with us we checked in with a long line but fortunately have checked with the ground crew that i can fall in line in business class lane since i am a sindbad silver holder everything was smooth until the boarding they prioritized us boarding the plane because i am a sindbad silver member and i have an infant and kid travelling with me unfortunately an hour after the plane take off we complained already with the flight attendant to adjust the air conditioners temperature since it is hot they said they will not knowing that there was indeed a problem with the airconditioning for the whole flight it was really hot no one from the crew apologized on the condition and for the passengers we just have no other choice but to pacify ourselves
22990,xiamen airlines,5,seats not very comfortable,flew xiamen airlines from singapore to hangzhou and back crew were generally helpful however there was one male flight attendant who was exceptionally rude note that mobile phones cannot be used throughout the flight even in airplane mode as this is china aviation authority ruling food is acceptable the cabin seats are not very comfortable xiamen airlines is not recommended for medium or long haul flights
19961,thai airasia,6,received governmental snack box,bangkok to phitsanulok on a business trip and allocated on a hot seat with breakfast preordered by my host btw when it comes to serving i received only a governmental snack box but not the preordered chicken curry with rice flight attendants seem to recognise the problem but could not answer why this happened after waiting until other passengers finished their meals for a very short flight i was given the preordered tray to eat as rapidly as possible for the record rice was still fridge cold and the curry not adequately warm
14536,malindo air,1,never fly by this airline again,we had booked 2 tickets for perth to kolkata return from kolkata to perth malindo cancelled the perth to kolkata flight offered another one after 2 days which we did not take as we had booked for a short stay in india did not want to waste our days so we went by thai airways instead but while coming back we kept the ticket came back to perth with malindo they have issued us travel vouchers for the unutilized part of our ticket which do not cover the price we paid for our ticket also i paid more for my ticket25 kg baggage charge than my husbands 20kg baggage charge but i have got less refund amount on my voucher than my husbands i complained to them several times by sending detailed emails calling multiple times but after 3 months my problem is still not solved every time a new person answers the phone or a new person deals with the email they do not bother to go deep in the matter give stupid replies which is very frustrating they do not even have a toll free no one of the customer representative emailed me that the refund amount should be 35599 which pertained to my husbands ticket but the actual travel voucher amounts are 34089 for my voucher it is 33839 which does not make any sense we will never fly by this airline again
2089,air macau,6,air macau customer review,an hour late leaving taipei plane seating was very tight but ok for me staff immaculate and very polite probably this airlines saving grace food was hot but a bit bland couldnt hear hostess or pilot on the intercom return flight was ok smaller airbus but seating adequate again food was nice and hot but i had to ask for tea which should be served after meal i didnt expect too much from an hour and a half flight but they could supply headphones and music also both flights were serviced by steps no airbridge surely this wouldnt affect pricing too much would it overall fair for the price but some attention to detail needed
15938,petroleum air services,8,petroleum air services customer review,sshlxrssh dash 8 q300 a bit dubious as i had never heard of this egyptian carrier and the name doesnt inspire a great deal of confidence but i was pleasantly surprised a new aircraft on this short 50 minute flight comprehensive safety demo in english that was understandable complimentary juice and a small snack provided i would not hesitate to use this airline again
458,aerolineas argentinas,3,most narrow seat i have ever seen,new york to sao paulo via buenos aires the most narrow seat i have ever seen my knees came touching the seat in front of me during the whole 10 hour plus flight fas in a bad mood food was just ok but the breakfast was awful the only good thing i have to tell about them is that the flight was on time and my baggage which inlcuded a big fragile box got to destintation without any problems
13201,kuwait airways,6,three seats to myself,new york to dubai via kuwait before booking i had read many reports about the improved kuwait airways and unbeatable price i was unsure what to expect the checkin was a breeze at jfk and the agent said it was a light flight with about 3540 load factor that was surprising being just a day before eid boarding was easy and the aircraft pushed back 15 min before schedule jfkkwi flight the aircraft very clean and seats comfortable legroom was fantastic i managed to get a window seat and had all the three seats to myself rather almost everyone in the aft cabin had 3 seats to themselves individual tv screen was very responsive with a decent collection of programming the crew was friendly and courteous menus blanket and basic amenity pouch handed out food was ok but can improve in quality was concerned about the short 45 min connection in kuwait but the flight arrived about an hour early kuwait airport is medieval and dirty with a few coffees and dutyfree shops security checks are not centralized but occur at each gate leading to long lines and delays my kwidxb flight b 777300 er was packed and was delayed more than an hour due to long lines at gate security the short flight was uneventful and were handed out in a takeaway iftar meal boxes so an in all a rather good flight return leg dxbkwi a320 was short and uneventful with breakfast boxes handed out kwijfk via shannon was painful with an 85 load long security lines at the gate in kuwait one of the kuwaiti pax who i chatted with was like this flight is always delayed multiple security checks and verifications lotta connecting passengers mostly from south asia and some of them didnt know the flight had a stopover at shannon lunch served and amenity kits handed out my choice of meal had run out but was nothing great all pax deplaned at shannon to go through multiple hellish security points and get back in about 2 hrs it just gave time to stretch and use the toilets cabin crew was cheerful and courteous but i asked for blankets and was told none remain however at the time of deplaning at jfk found an open overhead bin full of blankets verdict decent airline but kuwait airport needs an urgent upgrade shannon stop over is painful yes fantastic price beating some of the major middle east airlines by 35 on this route if youre not budget constraint choose a better airline for this route
10870,hawaiian airlines,9,really carry the spirit of aloha,hawaiian airlines is really the airline to fly with between the hawaiian islands there was a hiccup on my experience but it was handled very well terminal 1 in honolulu had been completely refurbished from the last time i had visited 10 years ago and feels very modern airy and welcoming but less islandstyle simple and relaxing which is what the other airports around hawaii feel like security took less than five minutes and there was plenty of seating at our gate i had two trips with hawaiian from honolulu to lihuekauai and honolulu to kahuluimaui both these flights are what i would describe as up and down flights literally 3 minutes after we reached cruising altitude we already started our descent one of the funniest things that i realised was that on both trips the flights out of honolulu was operated by the same aircraft n483ha and left from the same gate a19 when i asked the gate agent on my second trip about the aircrafts registration i told her i flew this exact plane and left from this exact gate to kauai two months ago she was extremely nice and joked that i should buy it since it was my plane that really made my day onboard even though these aircraft are around 20 years old they did not feel too old and the 23 seating configuration is great for couples and families i definitely recommend choosing an a window seat when departing from honolulu to get a great view of waikiki beach the seats themselves actually dont recline and have a small drinks tray no way you could get any work on your laptop done considering the longest flights these planes do are 45 minutes i dont see any issue with the buslike seats the surprising thing is that during these up and down flights the flight attendants still come round and offer passengers water juice or coffee the latter only on morning flights even with the limited service due to the short flight time i still had great interactions with the flight attendants the return from kahuluimaui was a bit of an issue where all the flights that day got delayed due to a storm in honolulu i went to the check in counter to ask if they could rebook me onto an earlier flight and i was rebooked at no extra charge hawaiian airlines operation has a lot of quick turnarounds giving very little leeway for delays the knock on effects went on for hours however given how quickly the agent was able to rebook me onto an earlier flight and luckily i didnt end up in a middle seat it shows that they can handle a crisis very well indeed the flight they had rebooked me onto was still delayed but it meant i got into honolulu an hour earlier than if i was still on my original flight overall hawaiian certainly excels in terms of its product and beats other us regional carriers by miles they really carry the spirit of aloha onboard and i would definitely choose them over southwest when flying interisland except if i needed to check any luggage
1877,air india,2,nothing was working at all,rusty old broken aircraft ground staff at vancouver airport misguided me for not upgrading my flight to business so unable to upgrade my tickets and suffered a flight in economy class booked seats by paying extra money and seats were the worst broken arms broken entertainment system nothing was working at all for 15 hrs of the flight we just sitting looking at blanks screen very very poor aircraft rusty or cushions broken seats useless entertainment systemseven though business and economy seats were vacant the crew were not able to provide us alternatives which is a shame i will never ever travel again on air india flights and would never recommend anyone using it
22114,viva air,1,worst airline ever,cusco to lima worst airline ever before we even arrived in peru they changed our flights twice as much as a day so our whole tour was effected today our flight was cancelled and only option given was later tonight so we missed our connection to iquitos which affects our iquitos hotel booking and amazon tour they offered free lunch and hotel the hotel we couldnt arrange until lining up in lima airport al over again zero information we have had to book another airline for 6 people so we can make our amazon tour absolutely furious
11837,japan airlines,7,one of the truly best airlines in the world,found a great deal and flew with jal when i traveled from southeast texas to singapore jal staff in seattle werent particularly friendly but jal staff at narita were quite pleasant and helpful in my brief interactions with them the quality of the meal and drinks were quite satisfactory for economy class they had a decent selection of entertainment from around the world including some japanese movies that i ended up watching with english subtitles the plane and lavatories were clean the onflight personnel the utmost in being pleasant and professional one flight attendant in particular cindy from singapore chatted with me about singapore for a minute and wished me safe and enjoyable travels to that city something else i got up and went to the toilet and came back only to find my neck pillow missing im convinced that some passenger stole it who does that steal a nondescript black neck pillow at any rate i disembarked the plane after landing at narita right before walking out of the jetway i still wanted to try to at least make one more effort to find that neck pillow i explained to the flight staff that i was looking for a pillow and it had gone missing 56 flight attendants sprung into action with me to look for that pillow while it was never found i made sure to smile and say thank you i have a hard time imagining that that level of service would ever occur on a north american airline the only reason that ive reduced jals rating from 9 to 7 is because trying to call email or contact them otherwise through my online jal account about changing flights is absolutely like pulling teeth this has been a problem for a different trip than this one jal desperately needs to work on aspects of their offflight customer service at least for nonjapanese customers nonetheless theyre still one of the truly best airlines in the world
1322,air canada rouge,4,80 min before moving,toronto to kingston 115 pm departure time all people on board door close then they started loading luggage finished loading 155pm sat on the plane for longer than 80 min before moving why board if luggage not loaded or not scheduled to load
20607,tigerair,6,services are getting better,i could fly one way on tigerair singapore to and from different destination at low cost inflight beverages at reasonable price as desired online booking is easy after first time the total cost for each flight could be inflated by default charges untick those unwanted items like checkin bag insurance sms alert will show the difference my family and i flew more than 8 flights a year with tigerair singapore last 6 years never encountered technical delay newer plane could be the reasons cabin services are getting better each flight

8852,ethiopian airlines,4,there truly has been a major decline,ive flown ethiopian airlines as a business class passenger on multiple occasions there truly has been a major decline on the quality of service provided to cloud nine passengers furthermore there always seems to be some sort of delay with their flights on my most recent trip such delay caused me to miss my final connection from toronto to phoenix which resulted in me being stranded for over 14hrs there was no apologies or any attempt from ethiopian airlines to get me to my final destination sooner needless to say i wont be flying ethiopian airlines again

17046,royal brunei airlines,9,seats were spacious,this was a great flight the seats were spacious and fairly comfortable the food was very good with at least two choices the two short stops made the long route much easier to bear and broke it up exactly at the right times all flights on time professional and friendly staff inflight entertainment was just right would highly recommend royal brunei airlines and have flown with lots of different airlines in the past
7145,citilink,4,not fly with them again,denpasar to jakarta im giving a rating of 4 is because the flight was right on time the person at the check in counter let another passenger jump the queue even after i told her what happen she asked me if i want a window seat and i accept it but instead assigned me in a seat between two people airport security they stop me saying i couldnt bring a camera tripod inside the aircraft i had to return to check in and asked to have my main luggage back so i can put it inside they manage to get it back and i place my tripod inside all of this took some time so once back at the security they were already call for the last passenger for my flight so i had to jump the very long queue and try to find by myself the same security guy that stopped me earlier so i could ask him to pass in front of everyone maybe it was just a very unlucky day but i will not fly with them again
15282,norwegian,2,goodwill gesture was 270,new york to gatwick return norwegian has a promotion whereby one can bid to upgrade to a premium seat a few days prior to our return to jfk we bid and our 1275 bid was accepted and paid for as we were notified by email when we got to the airport we discovered that our bid not been honored there were no seats for us in premium but we had been put on standby it was only after some heated haggling at the gate that we got seat assignments but they were worse than our originals and not contiguous so a tremendous inconvenience resolved only after much discussion after many exchanges with norwegian air customer service they refunded the 1275 upgrade bid the goodwill gesture they were prepared to make for not honoring our bid putting us on standby and then giving us worse seats than we originally paid for was 270 pretty shocking
8828,ethiopian airlines,7,flight time is good,the flight time is good it leaves on time at 0020 hrs in the morning and reaches mumbai by 08 00 am thereby passengers can have a good sleep after the dinner the service is good except that the air hostess after dinner vanishes and arrives for cleaning up the leftovers just half an hour before landing and they do not have time to attend to passengers many passengers after waking up from sleep require a cup of water it will be nice if an hour before landing the passengers are served with water
10694,gulf air,3,i lost my flight,i booked a flight gulf air from dubai to hyderabad via bahrain flight was delay in dubai 30min when we reached in bahrain no one announce flight left to hyderabad after checking with customer care they said we already calling customer hence i lost my flight then i book a return back ticket to dubai i asked on counter for my luggage they said we will loaded in dubai flight when i reached dubai airport cant find my luggage

17013,royal brunei airlines,3,no rba ground staff to be seen,i flew rba from kota kinabalu to london via bandar seri begawan and dubai on 30 december 2016 we experienced a delay in dubai for almost 16 hours due to fog in the uae i understand that this is beyond the control of rba however the appalling situation was that there was no proper communication and no rba ground staff in dubai airport to assist stranded passengers either the rba staff have taken off their uniform not wanting to face the frustrated customers im not entirely sure but they cannot be identified at all we arrived into dubai at approximately 130 am from brunei and have been stranded until 520 pm on 31 december 2016 with such a long delay we should have been given a hotel we were also not given any meal voucher but was told to go to either mcdonalds or kfc for meals upon reaching the mcdonalds counter i was told i could only choose either a beef or chicken meal but i am a vegetarian and i was told they could not help me without rba authorisation but there was no rba ground staff to be seen i was supposed to reach london at about 640 am on new years eve to celebrate the countdown with my wife and children but we only arrived at 930 pm into heathrow as i live in somerset i only reached home at 1230 am on new years day to a disappointed family i thought rba has improved with the service after many years for not flying with the airline but i now feel i have made a terrible terrible mistake in choosing rba once again with this trip
10218,garuda indonesia,8,the crews and the meal saved the day,jakarta cgk to manado on board ga600 frankly if it was not for the service aspect of this flight i wouldve given this flight a 610 max the service itself was the boosting factor of this flight the checkin staff at jakarta was fast friendly and efficient so all of us were able to check in real fast despite the crowds flocking each checkin counter boarding was orderly despite stumbling a bit on the jet bridge and upon boarding the plane i spotted several product issues the cabin was clean but was kept at a high temperature during boarding the windows and the right wing of the airplane were undermaintained for so long that i was barely able to see the window clearly and the paintings to peel off and the headrest of my seat had shrunken to the point that i felt like i was leaning against a piece of metal adding insult to injury the inflight entertainment experienced a major downgrade no more live tv shows no more games and my headphone jack was nearing its breaking point the selections were excellent if this flight was taken in 2018 but they were severely outdated by 2022 standards its responsiveness was not any better the aircraft took off late and we queued for a very long time at the taxiway with a scorching hot temperature inside the cabin at this point i was already about to give this flight a 410 but then the crews and the meal saved the day both adding 2 points each the crews were extremely friendly polite and proactive it all started when they escorted me from the seat and even during disembarking they were still in a happy and energetic mood they apologized when they forgot my order on this 3hour flight they also proved that theyre still above anyone else by serving not one but two meals the first one was a grilled fish with rice and vegetables while the second one was a piece of strawberry bread we were also given two bottles of drinks a bottle of water and a bottle of tea with other options still available upon request overall this flight was salvaged by the service aspects of the flight had the services been as bad as the product i wouldnt have given this flight an 810 garuda really should consider balancing its service and its product i know that theyre experiencing a hard time nowadays but who knows that the act of balancing service and product can save garuda this flight was a true representation of the following statement a grade service with a b grade product
22671,wingo,2,customer service is completely non existent,do not fly this airline unless you absolutely have to on a positive note the plane was fairly comfortable if you have a problem with your flight you will not be able to resolve it and you will just lose money and be angry like i am there are a million problems with the website and customer service is completely non existent at this company try calling their us number before you decide if fly if youre an american citizen it just hangs up on me right away the wingo desk at bogota airport is also very poorly trained and unfamiliar with many rules as you know there are always small issue that arise when flying and its too risky to fly wingo
14855,monarch airlines,7,monarch airlines customer review,lgwinn return for ski holiday charter both directions had an a321 with older clean seats given exits without asking on the way out and standard seats on the return it would have been nice to be able to checkin online but on charters this isnt possible apparently queues at both airports no more than 15 minutes i noticed the cabin crew taking time with all customers and being friendly and professional in my opinion the onboard menu is rather dull and i cant figure out why airlines cant sell stuff of the quality of high street coffee shops either heated or fresh both flights were on time and the return flight was in fact early to leave and arrive monarch is distinct because of its high quality cabin staff and characterful identity no problems experienced but nothing amazing about it all either would use again with no problem
21281,turkmenistan airlines,6,turkmenistan airlines customer review,i took the flight from frankfurt to bangkok via ashgabad and i must say it was ok the flights left on time and there was a transfer time of aprox 1 hr at ashgabad in the middle of the flight which is quite convenient the food came in large portions and consisted out of a lot of meat the personnel was not over friendly the inflight entertainment doesnt exist bring your own
8956,etihad airways,2,a very disappointing experience,just had a very disappointing experience flying etihads new business class on their a350 first the good the planes interior design is very attractive now the bad 1 etihad uses air indias lounge at jfk seriously this was one of the dirtiest and least attractive airline lounges ive ever been in we left within minutes of arriving 2 many of etihads online systems both app and online just dont function correctly it was not possible to manage any part of my booking online or via the app not possible to choose seats or checkin 3 while the plane is beautiful scratch and youll discover that beauty is only skin deep many of the new planes innovations do no function properly outlets dont work the silly builtin phone charger didnt work the entertainment controller was extremely unresponsive and didnt work effectively seat was not comfortable compared to other business class seats 4 the bathrooms were not clean and did not function well 5 worst of all on this flight was the service while the flight attendants were nice enough they didnt provide some of the basic service id expect even if flying economy glasses and water bottles were never collected my empty coffee mug sat on my tray for almost an hour and no one ever thought to ask if i wanted a refill 6 the cabin was kept ridiculously warm making it impossible to sleep 12 hour flight without a minute of sleep in the future i will stick with emirates singapore and qatar when expecting a premium airline experience
5797,blue1,6,blue1 customer review,helcphhel helcph on avro rj85 ontime both ways clean aircraft crew and service are nothing special but seats comfortable and spacious in the 3x2 configuration cphhel on b71 food for purchase in both directions drinks free in general this is competitive to sas on the same sector but definitely a lowcost feel without a particularly lowcost price
11243,iberia express,8,overall a very nice flight,flew them before and despite low cost business class is a joy i booked economy but on check in i was able to purchase an upgrade for a really small fee which included lounge access and preboarding seats are a bit cramped for someone over 190 meters but with an empty middle seat not an issue service was great staff was very attentive though not fluent in english they cared for their passengers a really nice warm lunch was provided with beverages spanish products are served and i like this pride for their county wifi was available for a small fee overall a very nice flight 215 h and perfectly on time
11353,icelandair,8,the staff was wonderful,the staff was wonderful my luggage was lost on my return flight but arrived at my home in pennsylvania i received a call from copenhagen everyone was so nice the us staff was terrible in baltimore when i arrived such a disappointment but nothing to do with icelandair my only complaint is that there was not enough air on the plane the sun was on my side of the plane and heat was radiating thru the blind i could not lay my head against the window because it was so hot i am closer to harrisburg airport but chose to drive over an hour to baltimore just so i could fly icelandair i will do it again
19065,srilankan airlines,6,the cabin lights didnt dim,i was very tired and i was expecting to sleep during the flight unfortunately i cant sleep because the cabin lights didnt dim throughout the flight and the cabin crew selling the alcohol in the middle of the flight which is very noisy also passengers keep gathering and talking in very loud voice 1 hour before landing i was felt so thirsty and i contact the cabin crew from my seat more than 5 times but no one approached me till we landing
4172,american airlines,1,her diligent and quick efforts,mellisa from american airlines is the one who saved a summer vacation for her diligent and quick efforts to save our flight which was cancelled at the last minute shes the hero to 3 kids who will have a blast and will experience memories that will last a lifetime thats sometimes all it takes doing the part that were meant to do and doing it with heart she was on the check in counter 7202023 at 6am
1598,air europa,2,disorganized check in and chaotic boarding,chaotic disorganized boarding older male member of air europaswissport was yelling at business class passengers if you want to fly you need step back and listen to me very rude and unprofessional some older passengers got shaken by his attitude i have complained to local air europa female supervisor who did not supervise boarding instead she was hiding below the escalator with a male colleague that is a clear job failure they had no announcement about delayed boarding they do not have boarding group lines organized and clearly marked we had a similar experience in january in madrid disorganized check in and chaotic boarding seems to be a chronic disease of air europa it spoils passengers experience and the reputation of the airlines
9991,flysafair,9,the best experience,cape town to durban but from the get go upon checking in how awful of me with the pain i was already in the attendant that assisted me in ct international was the best like a godsend at that time of morning and his willingness to assist me and make my check in such a breeze also inflight the cabin crew were the best i also had the best tasting cappuccino extremely helpful and courteous staff our flight arrived 20mins ahead of schedule now that for me was the cherry on top to flysafair crew and ground team thank you so much for the best experience especially with having to have had to fly with my medical condition
19177,sriwijaya air,6,fairly new aircraft and good staff,denpasar to dili with sriwijaya air and mostly okay checkin in bali was a bit disorganised but once i got to the front of the line i was dealt with quickly inflight staff were generally good and professional speaking indonesian and english the only problem being their aggressive promotion of duty free goods including leaning across me for long periods while their scarfs fell all over the place also offsetting the service was the worst inflight meal ive ever had i think it was a battered fish fillet but it was so tough it could also have been chicken it came with cold fries and some tinned vegetables that were the best part of the meal doesnt matter it was a short flight with fairly new aircraft and good staff sriwijaya air probably one of the best indonesian regional airlines
17695,scoot,9,appreciate the help by the ground crew,thank you so much scoot ground service crew members in penang with the help what happens was that i have forgotten about a souvenir small knife in my hand carry before board the flight they rushing to help me keep my souvenir knife into my small bag and help me check in the bag hence my souvenir is back with me i truly appreciate the help by the ground crew
15472,oman air,3,not sure whether they will refund or drag on,i have booked my tickets in feb2020 to fly out in july and due to covid the flight got cancelled when asked for a refund the airline assured refund but only after one year of booking now a year has passed and they only keep issuing request number on mails without any official communication not sure whether they will refund or drag on
15124,nok air,5,i was disappointed,flew nok air from phuket to bangkok no priority at all this time i was disapointed i tried for the first time their premium seats as from the banner to their web site they offer priority check in boarding and baggage in phuket airport no special counter for premium no priority boarding at all seat was ok with enough leg room aircraft as usual dirty outside but clean inside nice and gentle staff inflight but its true that they do not smile anymore as once upon a time snack improved extra coffee or tea as premium no priority baggage at all i took my bag last after 40 mins nice surprise the wifi recommend yes for the leg room in premium seats if to the first row or next to emergency exit and wifi no for the rest
15095,nok air,7,in general it was comfortable,took nok air from dmk to urt champhon as it offered the earliest flight for the day first impression is that the airline is really cute the whole bird theme stuck throughout the planes are painted in different colors and the nose always has a beak this theme was also present in the cabin service the stewardesses wore yellow and all the materials were really well thought out to present the brand image as a pr person this is refreshing especially from a budget airline seat pitch was quite tight however in general it was comfortable the service was slightly better than other popular budget airlines brands in asia the stewardesses came only once after the seatbelt lights were turned off and dimmed the cabin lights for us to sleep i would recommend this brand since i think at least for a budget airline they made the extra effort to stay on theme
16078,phuket air,6,phuket air customer review,my wife is thai and her home town is near buriram in ne thailand we have to fly bangkokburiram when we go there phuket air recently took over the route from air andaman we were very impressed for a small airline much better than air andaman very smart cabin crew good service served a small snack which was quite tasty for only a 45 minute flight they have recently started flying bangkok to london gatwick so would be interested to find out what they are like long haul
12494,jetstar asia,9,jetstar asia customer review,osaka to manila with jetstar asia i have to admit that i was quite sceptical about flying jetstar for the first time self checkin at kansai airport went smoothly so did bag drop it was nothing out of the ordinary for what i would expect from a low cost carrier i was actually pleasantly surprised by how well everything was because of the bad rep that this airline supposedly has
13066,kulula,2,we are once again delayed,johannesburg to east london typical of this inefficient airline we are once again delayed how can this airline charge their customers full price when they continue to delay flight times and which in turn not only creates problems for the customer but costly too
19697,tam airlines,6,tam airlines customer review,flew from gru to scl on 4 january seat 2a quick efficient check in flight was on a seemingly older a320 cabin crew were polite and attentive kept filling up drinks meal was ok no individual ife screen only 2 screens for the three rows of business class seat only partially reclined made sleep difficult but only a 4 hour flight expect more for international business class
8157,dragonair,8,dragonair customer review,hghhkg return in march good flights and safety conscience crew with good updates from the flight deck aircraft had decent legroom and food was ok except they ran out of the western option when the flight was only around 60 full but with only a 2hr flying time its not really an issue
5808,blue1,4,blue1 customer review,arnhelarn in premium economy cold food but wine quite ok in rj85 try to get row 14 since pitch is 32 there otherwise as said quite ok being a commuter line ahead of schedule both legs
3872,alaska airlines,6,you get what you pay for,they put me on 2 different types of jets i cant recall the type or pull it up because i purchased my tickets through priceline i wound up with alaska airlines because the tickets were free cant beat free the experience wasnt terrible the first jet was small and i had to walk on the landing pad in order to board and get off for that particular jet everyone that had carryon with wheels they had to put it in cargo they did have have beverages and pretzels the seats for that particular jet were smaller than your average plane seat it was a little over an hour flight and it wasnt super uncomfortable mind you im 190lbs woman the second jet was much more comfortable they had beverages looking at their prices theyre not terrible for what you get you get what you pay for if priceline ever offered alaska airlines for free again i wouldnt hesitate at all
4064,allegiant air,1,will never fly allegiant again,we were ticketed for the early morning flight from provo to mesa rcvd and email saying time to check in so the night before we did our checkin silky smooth using the allegiant app all good flight says on time this is about midnight for an 815am departure we show up at the airport to do the bag drop but there is no bag drop line just one line for ticketing checkin and bags we wait in line and after about 20 mins an agent calls out anyone on the mesa flight has to see her turns out the flight the night before was 8 hours late so our flight was getting bumped 12 hours didnt we get the email no email no text no alert on the app none of the other passengers we talked with had any notice either agent offered to book us on their noon flight but that flight is full the event we were traveling for was for tonight so our plans were blown up totally we offered to drive to slc to get a flight on another airline but they were unwilling to book us told we should be getting a 100 voucher and our tickets would be refunded in a week or so and if we dont get refunded come on back in and they will work on it last minute pricing and flight available prevented us from rebooking ourselves so home we go love flying out of the smaller regional airports but will never fly allegiant again
7624,corsair,9,corsair customer review,our flight from montreal to paris was a great experience and an example of superior customer service when we checked in at trudeau i inquired about tgvair the person at the counter was quick to give us tickets for the shuttle between orly and massy tgv she also put priority tags on our bags so that we would get them as quickly as possible when we landed that was the case and we were in plenty of time for our train at massy all tolled it took us an hour and ten minutes from the time we touched down to sitting at the train station now that is efficient there was a little waiting before boarding that seemed unnecessary and the food is not that good but edible one thing that they do is serve children first which was fantastic for my 4 year old son the ticket price is unbeatable and i would challenge anyone to find a lower price for montrealparis in july i will definitely be using this airline in the future
4137,amaszonas,7,ground and onboard service was fine,first time flying with this airline all in all ive heard positive remarks about them so ive been wanting to take a flight with them not much i can say as they did their job properly ground and onboard service was fine as its a regional airline i think all of their planes are small sized ie embraer the only comment i have about their comapny site it wasnt easy to buy a ticket there so i ended up buying it from an agent
3305,airasia india,8,were all so warm and helpful,guwahati to bangalore i was travelling with my 2 year old son who was down with fever the crew was very kind and empathetic and took personal care of us on board one staff in particular made the journey very comfortable ground staff was very helpful in bangalore airport thank you very much to all the staff despite the flight delay they were all so warm and helpful i look forward to flying with airasia again
5877,bmi regional,1,bmi regional customer review,edizrh impressed and would recommend checkin was quick and efficient by servisair at edi aircraft was an embraer 145 and has a 12 seating arrangement the fight was lightlyloaded at around 20 pax out of a possible 49 boarding was so so servisair edi appear to have a bad habit of gathering passengers and have them wait outside in the cold until the flight crew are ready to receive them i have encountered this situation before at edi on other carriers flights the flight departed early and a light snack was serviced on board by the cheerful cabin crew member the captain provided plenty of inflight information and arrival at zrh was around 20 minutes early i would travel with bmir again i have travelled with them before when they were a star alliance member this is the only negative for me the present lack of an airline alliance under the new ownersmanagement i hope they are working on this issue
1401,air china,7,air china customer review,london to beijing return boarding was smooth and on time i was welcomed and shown to my window seat these are the old style 2x2x2 with the window seat having no direct aisle access the small fixed partition between the seats offered a little privacy but only when full flat the seat itself was very comfortable and the adjustments were easy to operate following a welcome champagne drink and hot towel the menus were handed out the announcements included a clear warningadvise for passenger behaviour on board the cabin was half full while taxing a crew member came to take my dinner order although there was a choice of three main courses i was told they had only one choice for dinner and breakfast left for dinner small appetisers were served followed by a seafood starter salad and hot breads the main fish course was ok but a little bland however a desert trolley came along and i was able to choose what i liked and settled for cheesecrackers and ice cream plenty to eat but not that great the wine served was good and topped up several times before coffee and cognac one of the crew came to apologise for the lack of choice in the food but it was not a major issue what impressed me was the smiling and attentive attitude of the crew i have read negative reviews about air china complaining about the lack of english spoken but for me that is the charm of communicating with others who may not be so perfect in other languages i really enjoyed my flight especially the friendly cabin crew a large pillow and thick blanket was provided for sleeping the ife was not fantastic with a very limited number of english movies the loccitane amenity kit was also basic on the 10 hour flight i managed about 4 hours sleep on my return flight the sound quality of the announcements was poor and i could hardly understand a word spoken yet it didnt deter me from enjoying a relaxing time considering air chinas low pricing in business class i would fly them again lovely cabin crew and comfortable seat overcame the minor shortcomings
9149,eva air,3,experience was pretty mediocre,my experience on the london bangkok route was pretty mediocre but lets start with the good the staff are fantastic welltrained polite efficient and gracious the eva web site is so full go glitches that it is practically unusable if you have a problem needing solving i wanted to retrieve my membership number and password which proved impossible over three months of trying when asked to enter my name it would reply please enter an english name when i called customer service in bangkok there was no reply ever cabin is nice but small and cramped feeling the herringbone arrangement is good but there is little privacy and the seats are narrow and not particularly comfortable i am tall and have a disability so im not their ideal customer there is no turn down service or mattress so you have a blanket and have to put that down and sleep on top of it the food was worse though as i recall eva always had great food and maybe covid has impacted this bangkoklondon offerings presentation is fine we got a beef dish with a potato gratin that had a strange scent my bead was microwaved plastic the hostesses quietly apologized arriving at 6pm in london as it grew dark we were served breakfast congee cereal and yoghurt and another weird omelette there was a thing called chicken with red cheese this shows total lack of management london to bangkok was marginally better food wise eva doesnt have a lounge a heathrow so they use the lufthansa one i need a wheelchair to get to gates they didnt send one boarding was an hour late chaotic and disorganized on board the chinese offering was good fresh and real and the oolong tea is a lifesaver but i didnt arrive feeling that i had enjoyed the flight tthe internet didnt work even though i paid for it
5099,azerbaijan airlines,8,food quality is very good,baku to london heathrow with azerbaijan airlines good vip checkin service in baku lounge is okay for a short stop the decor is nice but it has little to offer over a longer period departure ontime it was disappointing to have the older b767 on this flight rather than the better b787 which has flatbeds however the angled seat is more than adequate for an early evening flight and in any case i did not need to sleep good boarding service and service begins promptly after takeoff food quality is very good and there is plenty of it they even offer a plate of snacks before landing which i declined believe me you will not go hungry over the 6hours staff seemed a bit inexperienced and some of the service is a little clumsy but they are friendly and enthusiastic avod available and content is okay certainly not the best i have seen but enough to keep most entertained for this shortish flight a few minutes late into heathrow and a long taxi to terminal 4 but overall a fine experience and would use again
6040,british airways,1,inline with competitors,flight fine inline with competitors pleasant crew only niggle is bussed to and from aircraft at heathrow it seems like this is standard for the berlin flights would use again
18560,smartwings,5,wifi streaming available,prague to hurghada the checkin did not open until exactly 2 hours before departure then only 2 counters for our flight with over 200 pax this caused the departure hall overcrowded with about 1000 people as i boarded among the last passengers upon entering the aircraft it was clearly visible how packed it was got an exit seat 17f which had a very good pitch probably more than us domestic first classic at regular seats the legroom seemed nonexistent though seat itself narrow as on 737 can be very short and lacking an armrest on the exit side ontime departure shortly after takeoff one and only cart service began with drinks and limited snacks for sale only ordered vodka orange which was of a very good quality absolute miniature and 033l of a 100 oj staff stared at me upon requsting ice and it took them about 10 minutes to finally deliver it flight attendants seemed disinterested without a single smile there are no personal nor any other screens to my surprise an announcement that there is a wifi streaming available was made approx 30 minutes into the flight even without prelouded app there was a good selection of films and documentaries no flight map though my friend at back exit row seat was freezingly cold throughout the flight while temperature over the wing was fine a limited number of blankets and pillows was available which i did not use flight otherwise uneventful landed ahead of schedule with bags waiting for us there was a generous 23kg allowance 8kg carryon which was never checked
11124,horizon air,4,horizon air customer review,seamfr then mfrlax mfrlax is an important lifeline that i hope this airline never cancels as lately they have been pulling out of quite a few cities in oregon all flights on time and staff very friendly and professional no complaints really except the small seats interesting and fun choice of beverages this must be the only airline serving free wine and beer
7963,delta air lines,6,for first class i expect better,my boyfriend and i paid to sit in first class with the hopes of having a nice quiet experience although the food was good and the aircraft itself was clean and comfortable the flight attendants were horrible amari and another guy were very inconsiderate of the customers in first class they were both loud constantly talking and laughing slamming doors behaving like they were at home hanging out in their living room it was hard to sleep on the flight or just close my eyes for a little to rest very disappointing because all of the customers in first class were quiet and well behaved when were paying this kind of money for first class i expect better
2054,air koryo,7,air koryo customer review,shefnjshe in economy class on the way to pyongyang it was an old aircraft check in at shenyang airport was smooth and check in at korean air counter boarding was fine staff on board helpful and friendly due to the air conditioning the cabin was full of fog there was a lot of condensation no food for 15 hours flight to pyong yang check in at pyong yang was easy because there were not many flights at all departure and arrival are sharing same hall one room for everything but very efficient on the way back to shenyang was new tu204 very modern aircraft food was served a hamburger would recommend for the experience of the old aircraft one off experience i would fly again with the new aircraft in the future
12649,jin air,6,extra fees crazy,seoul to angeles manila this airline is cheap at first but the extra fees to book is crazy pay for any seat pay extra for food pay extra if the bag is over 15kg and as always delayed
8636,el al israel airlines,9,seats are nice and comfortable,tel aviv to barcelona this is the new flagship of el al replacing aircraft like the 767 and 747 the configuration is 3x3x3 and the seats are nice and comfortable entertainment systems is very good with a wide screen and the basic wifi is free service was very good

2853,air seychelles,8,air seychelles customer review,lhrsez outbound in pearl via milan return in economy via rome very unique feel to this airline its a small airline serving a small population plus tourists impressed by food service in both classes one of the best breakfasts i have had in business class and on the return offering 2 hot meals on a day flight was impressive staff were very friendly the whole thing did seem a little dated but in a good way the ife is still overhead tv screens with very lame films the stops in italy make the flights long but not too bad
9694,fly540com,3,fly540com customer review,nbomba atr42 not exactly new but well kept courteous inflight staff genuine smiles some refreshment option of coffee or soda and poorly packed 4 biscuits overall experience okay and suitable for the no frills traveller especially for short haul always compare prices though because they are at times higher than those for the national carrier which operate bigger and much faster shuttles on the same route
6822,china airlines,5,not impressed with the service,i travelled with china airlines a few times with no issues however on 070423 ci51 taipei to sydney i was not impressed with the service provided on board particularly by the male flight attendants not paying attention to customers needs on board or ignoring customers when getting off the flight is disappointing
8002,delta air lines,2,worst check in and boarding process,worst check in and boarding process ever i have flown multiple airlines multiple times have never seen anything as ridiculous as this checkin at lax many rude attendants and supervisors good for nothing they are not at all helpful and in fact make the process more cumbersome and time consuming i was going in the right line but they asked me to use the self checkin kiosk which i didnt want to but they still just wouldnt oblige the kiosk wouldnt scan my passport for whatever reason asked an agent to help he made a face like i asked him to move a mountain without even trying he asked me to go back to agent assist which was the original line i wanted to join now that line was huge and it took over 30 minutes for my turn the asian guy at the checkin counter was the only positive thing about this process he was smiling and doing his job with the right attitude i was not assigned a seat because it was a last minute emergency booking i stood in the line at the boarding area to get one assigned only to be asked to come back later 20 minutes later back in the huge line half way through boarding starts and guess what the same employee is responsible to help with that too no one knew which line to join what group what not nothing against the employee at the boarding area but the process in general was the issue after almost everyone boarded i was finally assigned a seat and allowed to board
6217,brussels airlines,6,the price was very low,venice to brussels with an old a319100 we checked in at their counter which was served from the save group of the airport of venice which treats you very sporty no matter which airline their serving at that moment as we had two pieces of luggage to check in and two carryons he offered to check for free in the carry on which was not that bad so going through security and all was smooth boarding was kind of awful as we had to board by bus and they got us stuck in the ramp which was under the sun and we had to wait like 20 minutes for the bus very surprising i saw that they had one row of business class without any type of separation actually we sat in our seats 8ab and we had a good legroom actually and the staff was very attentive as they were speaking fluently more languages englishgerman and french surprising was the inflight service as it was buyonboard but at least the hostess gave me some water for free the price was very low we had a good flight and staff was very polite
12938,klm royal dutch airlines,4,not received my promised compensation,i travelled with klm to attend a family wedding in dubrovnik in july and while the inflight experience was pleasant i experienced two issues afterword first there was some serious damage done to my luggage and second was a missed connection on my way home in both cases the airline advised to make a claim via their online portal for it to be handled for the damaged luggage i filed a claim on 13jul2022 and was finally resolved on 20oct2022 with a fair offer for compensation unfortunately it has now been over a month and a half and i have not received my promised compensation there has also been no further information provided or response to my inquiries for the second issue this was filed on 25jul2022 as a result of a flight disruption at schiphol airport this was due to ridiculously long security lines which caused me to miss my connecting flight despite having arrived several hours in advance after much back and forth i was advised on 22nov2022 that my claim was denied despite following all the correct procedures and providing all the required evidence there has been no response to my objection to date it has been a terrible experience trying to followup on these issues or get someone in authority on the phone but i tried again today by calling 8006180101 and was advised that my cases will be reinvestigated and a response provided in nine days i hope this gets resolved soon but i am not holding my breath

15384,olympic air,9,olympic air customer review,smiathsmi route once or twice a month oa uses small bombardier airplanes whose seats do not recline there is enough leg space i am 185cm and the seat width is fine there is no inflight entertainment the personnel has always been very polite and helpful the only problem with oa are the outrageously high prices for its domestic flights especially for destinations like smi where there is no competition
8065,dragonair,4,unexpectedly unpleasant flight,kolkata to hong kong with dragonair an unexpectedly unpleasant flight although the aircraft was newish and an ipad laden with a limited selection of entertainment provided the service was not up to par the flight attendant instead of providing me the menu card read out the options from the copy she held in her hand there was a couple with an infant who wailed through much of the night flight in a cabin with just 2 rows and 8 seats there is no escaping this misery very little sleep possible furthermore before landing i was unable to use the lavatory 2 flight attendants were on their knees cleaning the floor both inside and outside the lavatory it was splashed with water and covered with absorbent towels what a mess was glad to rush out of the plane when it landed
8830,ethiopian airlines,9,boarding very efficient,flew addis ababa to heathrow 5523 on ethiopians newest a350 only been in operation 6 days boarding very efficient bole airport very busy in the evening rush hour over 40 international departures in 3 hours the enlarged t2 copes well with this number of passengers several restaurants and cafes all busy prices reasonable two double macciatos 8 dollars have small dollar bills if in transit

11870,japan airlines,8,food was terrific,los angeles to jakarta via tokyo the cabin crew was so friendly and polite they smile from the heart the food was terrific it was amazing i will use this airline again
10630,goair,2,so much chaos at the airport,mumbai to lucknow i guess this is the only flight in the world which does not allow web checkin until you pay a minimum rs 49 for seat selection can they not even offer random selection and confirmation of seat 2 hrs before it causes so much chaos at the airport we do not expect a fancy seat for free but at least middle seat is one which no one is interested to pay for looking at city like mumbai which has the most foreign passengers and travel via connecting flights this flight is the worst option if you are stuck in traffic and then a huge queue at checkin and baggage drop its like hell i got to know about this policy just 15hrs before and did not expect this kind of service
12808,kenya airways,5,flight was suddenly canceled twice,its hard for me to write a review because i am not sure if the airline always cancels flights or if it is just problematic to leave from sudan my flight was suddenly canceled twice one of the times it was canceled was right before departure after i already took and paid for my covid test it was incredibly stressful i wrote to an assistant on whatsapp who told me it was a computer error and that my flight will still go and that i should just go to the airport but i felt it was not this way i called thankfully someone helped me and put me on a flight with ethiopian airlines and i flew with them via ethiopia so in the end i never flew with kenya airways it was an incredibly stressful experience and dealing with people over the phone was impossible in the end the woman i spoke to was the only helpful person and putting me on a new flight with another airline helped a lot from what i read they cancel often if it wasnt for this woman at the end i would give them a very low rating
9387,fiji airways,5,food was awful,the crew on the flight from los angeles to nadi 122215 were very friendly however on our return flight i dont think i saw one smile perhaps this late evening flight is a bit tiring on the attendants the food was awful and by the time the meals arrived to our area there never seemed to be any vegetarian meals available the entertainment options were okay
3709,airlink,9,i would like to compliment airlink,i would like to compliment airlink on their service and professional reservations assistance for our flights to skukuza from ct and back from hoedspruit they assisted with a cancellation in a professional and efficient manner as well as my daughter had to cancel a flight last minute due to durban looting and riots their covid protocols as well as service reliability no delays etc were great especially in a time when airlines have become unreliable due to the economic climate
17943,shenzhen airlines,4,impolite to their passengers,shubuling to shenzhen however did star alliance admit this low quality airline into their more prestigious alliance the website is absolutely awful in english and in chinese after failing to purchase a ticket through their website i managed to buy one on ctrip but then the online checkin did would not work however the verification function on the chinese language website reassured me that my ticket did exist airport checkin was ok as i was first in line however then the flight was delayed by an hour then after boarding an announcement of another half hour then half an hour later yet another delay i wondered if it was a ploy to avoid paying compensation and why they just did not let us deplane and wait in the lounge being vegetarian i would have needed to preorder my special meal but as web check in was not available i was not able to order the only positive was one very polite and helpful stewardess whom my translator guessed wanted to please the foreign guest as the flight crew was otherwise quite impolite to their passengers in flight entertainment heidi a german language film on a screen too distant to read the subtitles

9181,eva air,1,pay the difference or cancel the flight,the airlines cancelled my flight due to limited flight my original flight is may 20 due to this changes i have to make changes also on my connecting flight i asked to move it to june 11 i was told that i can only picked a date between may 24 to june 2 and for monday wednesday friday i asked to speak to manager if i can change it to june 11 since they are the one who decide to cancel the flight coming out of manila on tuesday and thursday the representative said that the manager will tell me the same thing because its a company policy and told me i will have to pay the difference or cancel the flight and book it somewhere else i understand theyre trying to consolidate their trip but if you are the one whos causing the inconvenience of customer you should be able to be flexible
19681,tam airlines,7,onboard tam were very charming and efficient,tam administration is a disaster took 3 weeks to establish what a schedule change was because the phone number provided is for lan who must raise a file number to any tam query and revert at their leisure i am a oneworld emerald card holder tam do not despite what their website says and what one world rules say acknowledge fast track departures at madrid people were being processed at fast track i had walk all the way back to join a very crowded general line they do not extend extra baggage allowance beyond 2 pieces 23kg each these gifts are only for tam privileges on their own card system onboard the flights tam were very charming and efficient some of the nicest flight attendants around boeing 767 has flat seats not overly comfortable in bed position thin blanket and pillow too but a nice roomy and accommodating cabin pretty good selection of movies on demand on a decent size bright screen food looked good but it was midnight so i didnt eat breakfast orders taken to order and served as per too bad their ground work is heading the way of lan who seem to work for the convenience of their employees more than anyone else
11127,horizon air,5,horizon air customer review,yvrpdxyvr both sectors operated by new q400 which is as quiet as a jet crew very friendly and service very informal but nice to be offered beer or wine and snacks on a short flight i have always found qx staff to very personable efficient and like their laidback friendly service will fly with them again

8946,etihad airways,5,etihad cant match the other carriers overall services,booked a return flight to thailand with etihad the first leg to abu dhabi was with an a350 brand new plane i must admit that etihad livery is the best one ive seen along with on timeish departure unfortunately they are the only positive things i can think of although the plane was new the seats are cramped a thing that i noticed to many other airlines with new planes and i am definitely not a tall person theyre just pouring as many seats as possible which is very inconvenient for longer flights surprisingly on the 777 plane from auh to bkk although was an older plane the seats were much more comfortable thus confirming what i mentioned above the food onboard was just average it lacks presentation and quality like you get on qatar emirates or turkish ife was just ok not too many options to choose from the crew was not as proactive as the other middle eastern carriers mentioned above together with auh airport experience an old and tired airport i must admit that my first experience was not so great with etihad and i really wanted to love them as they look so stylish apparently only from outside i usually fly to asia only with qatar and unfortunately etihad cant match the other carriers overall services and they are on the same price range
9953,flysafair,4,shouted at me in front of other people,i had a problem when i was doing the last check in before i board i was only holding my phone which had my boarding pass on the lady who was checking me in shouted at me in front of other people checking in asking me if it was my first time to fly as i didnt know that i have to present my id it was so embarrassing and she went on and on i did email flysafair with the complaint and noone got back to me the way she shouted at me was like im a small kid

10631,goair,8,seats are comfortable,mumbai to delhi seats are comfortable boarding and checkin staff helpful the boarding started on time there is no delay cabin crew is polite overall good
4424,ana all nippon airways,4,poor ticketing system,tokyo to kuala lumpur decent airline but poor ticketing and checkin system checkin at ana counter always takes me more than 30mins because their system indicates that the name on the checkin system and name on passport is the other way around first name last name this happens even though we strictly follow anas online reservation system guideline on how to input names for people from various countries i explained this to the ground staff at narita and haneda multiple times but their response is usually that the reservation system is handled by another department discrepancy between reservation system and check in system is definitely a possibility i cant add my miles because ana mile systems has a totally different rule for passengers without dedicated first name and last name so i have given up using ana mileage but now using united mileageplus my family and i are relatively frequent flyers yet we never experience this with other airlines with ana same problem has been going on for at least 2 yrs but we have not seen any improvement since
13380,lan colombia,9,lan colombia customer review,bogmzlbog i took them from bogota to manizales when i was visiting colombia in december the crew was fantastic airport staff was polite the planes were new comfortable and service was great tickets were very reasonable but book them early through the website to take advantage of the promotional fares which could equal 50 us round trip depending on where you are going and how early you book

18244,singapore airlines,5,cabin staff didnt seem very happy,hndsin was pretty poor cabin staff didnt seem very happy virtually had a bread roll thrown at me meal only one on a 7hour flight was not hot enough cold in places and tasteless bag drop at hnd was a disgrace the online check in queue moved faster than the other one with only two desks open it took 40 minutes there seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online the singapore airlines app is not very good either sinlhrsin were better good cabin staff and service and the food was hotter and better bag drop at lhr was smooth boarding well organized and smooth the pilot explained a touch and go landing at lhr well and there was no panic but it did mean we were 20 minutes late and we were already a little behind schedule singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check which took quite a long time on the outward trip i prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers sinhnd was better and the meals were quite good as was the service plane was old though booked the tickets eight months in advance and they were never cheaper yet they were only reasonable wifi is only available if you register your kris flyer number before you board which i couldnt because id already registered by ana mileage number why have this restriction
6409,caribbean airlines,9,my trip exceeded expectations,was originally due to travel in march 2022 but tested positive for covid19 caribbean airlines differed my ticket to a later date at no cost when i was ready to fly in may 2022 the call centre was able to rebook quite simply i used the opportunity to upgrade my ticket to business class which the agent did over the phone simple transaction i use the app for all my flight management with regard to seats meal requests etc bw60026jun posyyz operated ontime it was my first time using the new b737 max8 and was really impressed with the comfort of the cabin the ergonomics of the seat made for a super comfortable 6hr flight the ife is a big improvement on this aircraft and the aesthetic of the cabin is also very mod looking once of the highlights of this flight was the ability to preorder a meal in this case it was the stewed chicken with macaroni pie callaloo fried plantain a full on sunday lunch on a thursday night lol food was a generous amount and very tasty upon arrival in yyz i was expecting delays exiting the aircraft and getting thru immigration and customs news of lengthy delays preceded my trip but it was actually very easy bw60709jun yyzpos via geo another ontime departure early in fact i opted for this flight via geo because i preferred a daytime flight vs the redeye which operates nonstop yyzpos no regrets had a nice late breakfast in the lounge at pearson and then a another delicious preordered meal as we took off towards guyana this time i ordered the curry chicken or chicken curry with dhal and rice it was also a very generous amount and very tasty great flight down into the southern caribbean the crew on both flights my cabin crew were amazing they really do stand out from crews on other airlines in my opinion they are warm and compassionate and their service is graceful extremely professional overall my trip with caribbean airlines exceeded expectations and look forward to flying with them again soon i always feel that i have already arrived home when i step aboard a caribbean airlines flight no matter which gateway destination im at
17581,sata air azores,4,inconsistent service with this airline,i made a round trip with sata air azores from lisbon to ponta delgada the blue lounge in lisbon is nothing to write home about first of all its located on the other side of the airport from where the sata flights depart second the lounge was dirty not a good first impression when you fly business class the flight to ponta delgada continues onward to boston and boarding was quite chaotic boarding was announced and we had to make 2 queues which everybody did there is no priority boarding with this airline after the announcement nothing happened for 30 minutes and all out of sudden the announcement was made that passengers for ponta delgada should be standing in the right row and passengers for boston should be standing in the left row so everybody had to switch positions again after scanning the boarding passes it was down on the stairs were everybody had to wait for another 20 minutes before the busses arrived after the ride to the remote stand we had to wait again for 15 minutes on the bus because the aircraft was not ready yet during boarding there was no welcome from the crew it seems they were too busy chit chatting with each other the flight departed an hour late from scheduled departure time the aircraft was clean but looked a bit outdated from the inside strange since this aircraft is very new to their fleet food was very good however the entertainment system is not working after lunch i wanted to relax a little and decided to recline my seat 2k which did not work after notifying the crew that my seat was broken i was told its just a short flight and that was it not a great attitude towards a business class passenger on the way back to lisbon it was a better experience the lounge at ponta delgada airport is small but its just a tiny airport so no problem there were some fresh fruits cookies crackers nuts and sufficient drinks in the lounge the flight to lisbon on the a320 departed on time this time a friendly welcome from the crew and i settled into my seat no real business class seats on the a320 but a standard economy seat with the middle seat blocked service on this flight was good the crew was interested if i liked my stay on the azores food on this flight was not so great we got a very dry samosa with some vegetables and potatoes which were cold and very salty the flight did arrive on time in lisbon and after a bus ride from the remote stand again i arrived at the terminal building for my next flight to amsterdam to sum it up on my outbound flight to the azores the food was good but the crew was rude and the lounge was a mess on the inbound flight the lounge and the crew was great but the food was not
12859,klm royal dutch airlines,3,customer service is horrible,the klm europe agent changed my return date flight per my request but he forgot to issue the actual ticket so the klm auto system automatically canceled my ticket 24 hours before the flight a day before the flight i saw on klmcom that i was eligible for checkingin for the flight but then their system canceled my ticket and i was not able to fly that morning the klm has no agent or office in prague airport the klm europe office has limited hours they are closed on weekends and holidays exactly when many people are flying their customer service is horrible you cant get them resolve any issue with your ticket

2830,air seychelles,1,pay more and go by a reliable airline,i wanted to bring to your attention the pathetic experience i have recently had flying air seychelles and its partner etihad on the mumbaidar es salaammumbai route i booked a confirmed air seychelles mumbai to dar es salaam via mahe return flights on january 2016 for july 2016 a month later we were informed that air seychelles has stopped flying that route and has shifted us to etihad flight via abu dhabi i confirmed with the mumbai office of air seychelles and the flight was confirmed a week before flying i checked with etihad online and they informed me that my abu dhabi to dar es salaam sector was not confirmed neither air seychelles nor etihad had taken the effort to inform me of this situation in spite of purchasing a confirmed ticket in january if i had not followed up i would have been stranded in abu dhabi the air seychelles ground office in mumbai was equally clueless repeated emails from them to air seychelles and etihad on highest priority i was told went unanswered only after i threatened to take action did they swing into action and book us on kenya airways as a gesture we were informed that a special request for upgrade to business class has been put but of course as expected there was no record on the system during check in also the complimentary chauffeur service from etihad was not available as the pnr was not registered in the system the only explanation that i was offered was a system glitch this is irresponsible of both air seychelles and etihad i will definitely not be flying either airline i would rather pay more and go by a more reliable airline like emirates or qatar airways both etihad and air seychelles promise a lot but once the money is exchanged forget their responsibility
3788,akasa air,2,never recommend any to fly akasa,booked a flight from akasa air for only one reason time of travel was matching as per my work schedule writing this review while im boarded and wondering why isnt this flight not taking off delayed by 60 minutes remind you this 60 mins of delay is just to get you inside aircraft then another 20minutes and going on as im writing this review no announcements from captain or cabin crew stating the reason for delay even after being boarded and boarding is completed would never recommend any to fly akasa been a great fan of indigo since many years dont remember single flight being delayed while on journey almost every month since last 4 years

21515,us airways,2,us airways customer review,flew from washington to boston on economy arrived at the airport at 5pm for check in for 630pm flight after several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time after an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available finally boarding was announced at around 830pm after which it started to rain we were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain we sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather it was now after 10pm on disembarking i was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for rebooking but i later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night i was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day i was told rudely to take the 10pm flight or leave it and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation the plane had already been late i had to push and push to be offered alternative options eg flights to a different airport or with layover etc eventually they found a flight via philadelphia the next morning i asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told i had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full i overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so i have no idea what was going on after much persuasion a seat miraculously became available at 11am the next day bizarre i understand that delays and cancellations are not the fault of the customer service desk but they should at least be courteous understanding and helpful to passengers at a stressful time not dismissive
17445,sa express,5,sa express customer review,after 4 flights between bfn and jnb i must confess that there is no standard in the service one flight was excellent orange juice before the snack which was served with water and a drink the snacks are tiny the last flight from bfn we were told that due to the short flight time only water and juice would be served it was the same flying time as the other flights and two cabin crew onboard why no consistency
21443,us airways,1,no positives with us airways,there were no positives with us airways if i wanted delayed flights missed connection dirty planes and horrible customer service id fly spirit for half the price the customer service was horrible and flight was late on the trip to and from portland the staff were brusque as if their passengers were annoyances rather than customers return flight was so delayed we missed our flight us airways was extremely unhelpful it took an inordinate amount of time to get them to find us another flight 6 hrs later they were unwilling to even try booking us through to pdx via a different connection 0 stars

1448,air china,7,highly recommended,ca937 from beijing to london shameful ground service and excellent onboard services the ground service is an absolutely shame failing to do any customer service and even sound checking me in as a favor travelling with a toddler the ground service is simply say she does not care to put us together and it is our responsibility to check in early we arrived the airport 35 hours before the flight when checked the luggage we are allowed to check in 3 23kg bags but we only have 2 20kg and 24kg respectively the check in agent insists 24 kg is way too much without realizing we have extra bag weight not used and the weight per bag is not beyond 32kg absolutely shame asking us to repack in front of the long queue and force us to queue it again after rebalancing the stuff in the checked luggage in contrast the onboard service is fantastic seat ok with better than average leg room entertainment improving food is edible however the crew are exceptional frequent water runs over the night personal greeting in economy and also keep entertaining and interacting with our 22 months toddler even the flight is completely full could not ask for more and absolute fantastic air china could be a 5 star airline if the ground staff has half of the professionalism as the crews overall highly recommended
22981,xiamen airlines,3,transferring in xiamen was ridiculous,my family and i travelled from beijing to taipei songshan tsa and taipei tpe to beijing both times with xiamen airlines in economy class the good compared to other chinese airlines we found the food and drinks service to be much better the legroom on the boeing 787 from pek to xmn and viceversa was very good and the staff were friendly an ok selection of ife was provided on the 787 including a range of english speaking movies and many games on 3 of the 4 flights the kids were handed an activity pack which they enjoyed playing for about 10 minutes the bad legroom on the 737 between xiamen and taiwan was poor transferring in xiamen in both directions was ridiculous when we checked in at beijing our bags were tagged through to taipei however we were advised that we had to go to a separate counter at xiamen to get our boarding passes for the flight from xiamen to tiapei it was not easy to find where this was once we got to xiamen there were no instructions nor staff to assist once we found the counter we were told that it didnt open until 2 hours before the flight we had a 3 hour layover and there was nowhere available to sit and wait taking this in our stride it was like a red rag to a bull when as soon as we boarded the flight to taipei they showed us a video promoting how good skyteam was with their seamless transfer service it was worse when returning from taipei the bags could only be tagged to xiamen and boarding passes could only be provided to xiamen there was no specific transfer facility for connecting passengers that we could use to recheck bags onwards to beijing and no instructions whatsoever provided to assist in the transfer fortunately we live in mainland china so could find our way around the system however it would have been utterly confusing for passengers who had never been to china before with no assistance provided if xiamen airlines has aspirations of being a true regional and international player it needs to revisit its transfer services through xiamen and replicate those of other successful airlines in performing transfers its partparent airline china southern does a dramatically better job handling passengers through guangzhou
1220,air canada,2,treated so badly as a customer,i have never been treated so badly as a customer although some of the attendants were friendly and kind there was a very rude unhelpful entitled attendant who just seems to treat everyone is such a foul way our flight time also had changed and never received an email with the update we had issues checking into our flight 24 hours before they seem to split up people travelling together and were spread throughout the plane with no sense of organization all in all during our trip we flew 5 different airlines and air canada was the worst experience i will never fly air canada again
20673,tigerair australia,4,delayed from 1200pm to 625pm,our flight from sydney to gold coast got delayed from 1200pm to 625pm and would only give us a refund if we fly with another airline which was impossible to find a flight that wouldnt get us there late afternoon all they gave us was a 5 voucher per person for lunch and dinner we have had flights with them before and never had problem
20450,thomson airways,6,staff were very pleasant,gatwick to pula with thomson airways flight was on time and all staff were very pleasant travelling as a family of 4 2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 12 did not pay to reserve seats dont agree with it nobody should have to except if your paying for extra leg room etc this business of not being able to sit groups together was never a problem in the past planes have not changed so why has it suddenly become a problem over recent years outward flight we were sat 3 in one row and other person across the aisle return flight we were all sat separately row 20 25 29 and 39 other people were also sat apart and once all on board the flight attendants did a bit of juggling and without having to ask they approached me and had made 3 seats together so at least i could sit with the children
17773,scoot,6,the crew is very friendly,this short flight was great there is no ife and you have to pre order or buy your food food is in small portion and high prized the crew is very friendly and very professional of course boeing 787 is great but you have to pay for plugging in your electronic equipment unless you are in biz they provide paid wifi unless you are in biz but is slow that is worthless
20599,tigerair,2,lost loyal travellers,denpasar to singapore i am a regular customer of tigerair and in general quite satisfied with their value for money proposition now for our upcoming holiday i forgot to turn off the 20 kg addon luggage option that is the standard option for all of my 5 family members both ways at 27 per person the maximum added costs is 270 when i called their service hotline for some leniency it was made clear that once confirmed nothing could be refunded actually the lady said that no refund is possible for all services you added i calmly made clear to her that i didnt add anything but that her airline added it for me still nothing could be done tigerair just lost a whole family of loyal travellers
18116,silkair,9,silkair customer review,our flight from singapore to kuala lumpar was great the flight is only 45mins but had a drink service and wifi i didnt expect them to have this option you can also listen to music read about the airline and watch a small variety of movies this seats were comfortable the only disappointment was there was no snack with the drinks
6272,bulgaria air,7,a little bit slow,i flew bulgaria air e190 from sofia to varna two weeks ago the seat was ok the only food chocolate also the service a little bit slow but overall was good the flight was 30 minutes late and they made us get out of the plane and sit in the bus because they had to do a check
16694,regional express,7,friendly customer service,friendly customer service complementary snack and hot drinks were offered on board very reasonably priced my fare included checked in luggage up to 23kg plane was on time highly recommend this company
11606,iran air,9,crew were jovial,frankfurt to tehran and having been in various european and north american flights i was expecting iran air to be poor and possibly bad service however the crew were jovial and very helpful food was delicious and fresh great take off and landings of the pilots it was smooth
5649,blue air,2,charged me 70 euro for a bag,bucharest to larnaca they charged me 70 euro for a bag because it was bigger than their size by 2 cm also the personnel in gate control were very very rude
6315,bulgaria air,7,bulgaria air customer review,heathrow to sofia a very crowded flight but good staff if not overly friendly more or less on time good drink service and food okay i think air bulgaria need more flights at heathrow though as this was rammed newspapers circulated but no english ones on a flight out of london another dislike is the setbacks had very narrow rigid space for storing stuff meaning you were limited to one or two magazines but no space for water books etc
1362,air caraibes,7,air caraibes customer review,flew july from cayenne french guiana to paris in premium economy during an overnight 8 hours flight food ok seat premium economy standard seat very friendly service my wifes ife was not working crew were nice and asked another passenger if he would move as he was not using the ife
20798,transaero airlines,4,transaero airlines customer review,flew from tashkent to moscow then to new york the breakfast omelette was like a piece of rubber and tasted awful the other meals were no better the crew on the other hand was great with one exception the tv screen did not function at all but i slept most of the way anyway
20739,titan airways,3,seat belt buckles full of grime,nice cabin crew poor food offering arms on seats broken no entertainment screens or radio available spent nearly 3000 on holiday and felt like we were given the cheapest flight going also window was in a stupid position couldnt look out of it unless you leaned forward seat belt buckles full of grime terrible considering the covid situation
11126,horizon air,4,horizon air customer review,gegseafsn flew on the regional jet both to and from fresno but can tell that they have crammed more seats in the jet than the last time i flew it about five years ago seats were really tight service was fine flight late taking off from fresno but still made connections with alaska horizon has always offered good service normally i fly from puw to sea and find the service out of pullman to be excellent
3991,alitalia,8,i found them to be fine,flew rome to barcelona and i found them to be fine they were on time the flight attendants were courteous and efficient and they got my luggage on board the flight properly thus i would not hesitate to fly them again nor recommend them
20545,tigerair,4,flight got delayed for 2 hours,melbourne to canberra with tigerair got to the airport early because you dont want to stress the flight got delayed for 2 hours two hours passed the flight gets delayed another hour conclusion if you like chilling at an airport for half the day and spend money you dont have on food because youre starving then look no further and fly with tigerair they wont dissapoint
21560,uzbekistan airways,7,exceeded my expectations,moscow to tashkent i did not expect much from this airline however i was pleasantly surprised the aircraft seemed to be new and the interior was very clean the boarding started on time well organized both flights departed and arrived on time i paid a little extra for the exit seat and got a huge space for legs etc the personnel on board was average but meals were excellent and abundant the inflight entertainment system worked well funny english dubbing by a russian speaker one voice for all actors in movies the overall experience is naturally not comparable to companies like qatar or emirates but nobody expected that quality either all in all this airline exceeded my expectations and can recommend it to other passengers
13258,la compagnie,9,helpful and friendly staff,luton to newark return with la compagnie the deal of business class flight with five nights at a central nyc hotel was right up our street it turned out to be a very successful and enjoyable the flights were very good and punctual helpful and friendly staff very comfortable seats good entertainment but the food was the star delicious and well presented we used the business class lounges and at newark our boarding card got us 20 duty free discount highly recommended
21914,virgin australia,5,staff seemed unhappy and unhelpful,3 days prior i flew to sydney from brisbane with my 2 and 4yr old daughters and elderly parents via rex airline the staff were so friendly and plentiful complimentary food and drinks on board then at sydney airport when returning via virgin australia i asked for assistance with my elderly parents i got directed to check in bags counter then ticket counter and then back to check in counter for a wheelchair i was told they can help push 1 wheelchair for 1 parent but no buggy available for long journey to gate and then declined as i said we had to get food on way to gate on plane first flight delayed 10mins due to late crew member then no complimentary food and then only tea and coffee no juice or milk for my 2 and 4y old who i paid full seat price for when at end of flight my 2y old was busting to wee they said i can use toilet but needed to hurry up which was unnecessary to say and rude all staff seemed unhappy and unhelpful in general maybe due to financial pinch sadly i dont see a future for this airline
19437,swoop,8,staff was very nice,it all went smooth the price was 13 of the major airlines we added nothing extra our personal item just a little smaller than a regular carry on was free and we were seated together easy boarding they do tag carry on bags to ensure you paid the extra for them we took two flights a return journey both left on time and arrived early staff was very nice they did what they were supposed to take you on time to your destination as an economy air carrier
2258,air mauritius,9,this is highly recommended,paris cdg to mauritius my first flight with air mauritius and generally speaking i was impressed the aircraft was an a350 so the aircraft is relatively new which is always nice the business cabin was roomy and comfortable food and beverage service was good as was the quality of the food unfortunately wifi which is complimentary for business class passengers was out of service which was disappointing seats are lieflat bed type and are comfortable with enough space inflight entertainment was ok there was a good selection of films etc the boarding process at cdg was chaotic and very badly organised at mru ground services were excellent and speedy generally speaking very impressed with the air mauritius business class experience and this is highly recommended
10785,hainan airlines,6,mean with top ups for me,changsha to london a mixed bag of an airline the direct flights from london to changsha and return were on time smooth and trouble free cabin crew are pleasant and the seat space not too bad if a little cramped and lacking storage space the food drinks entertainment lounges that let the airline down my food was very poor for business class and the airline is clearly catering for its chinese customer base the films on board were limited and poor they offer you wine with your first meal but were very mean with top ups for me
3178,airasia,1,customer service is nonexistent,i like air asia for been a good low cost airlines but when you have an issue the problem are starting and you will find nobody at the end for a solution or at least an answer air asia changed the flight schedule by 5 hours and this was not compatible with my holidays so i asked for a refund on dec 2 on dec 16 i went through the long and inefficient talk with robot ava until i get in the queue for a human agent with n90 after an hour i got an answer your refund will be done in 2 days on dec 20 after playing again with ava for half an hour i was granted to the queue with number 144 and after 2 questions the chat was terminated by the agent or and i still not get and answer but every time the claim case was solved i guess this is a great satisfaction for air asia to close claims without answering their customer in fact ava was better than the agent but both are inefficient so i gave up with ava and called the phone voicemail service for air asia thailand i explained my case and after 24 hours still waiting for a call back when it should have been done in 24 hours but for urgent case i can contact ava joke form this experience i notice that the customer service at air asia is nonexistent but also when you consider the price of the ticket must check everything seat luggage food air asia is no more advantageous compare to a normal airlines like malaysia airlines or thai and for a small difference of the fare you can talk to a real agent instead of a stupid robot and incompetent agents for the future i will be careful before booking at airasia since this company reschedule and cancel flights many times since the start of covid and the new normal
5127,azerbaijan airlines,4,azerbaijan airlines customer review,baku to tehran and return the first flight was a pretty old atr72 which looked quite scary from outside inside was not bad and relatively comfortable the flight was pleasant and on time service on board was correct the return leg was very unpleasant the flight was supposed to leave at 220 am but due to the late arrival of the aircraft from baku it was delayed of 1hr then when the moment to board came we didnt have any news and the azerbaijan airlines ground staff disappeared just after 1 more hour a staff member was found by the other passenger and was obliged to give a public statement just in farsi announcing that due to heavy fog in baku the plane was delayed without indicating the exact departure time as im italian i could just get this information from another fellow passenger who translated to me at 7am the mob almost attacked an azerbaijan airlines staff member and obliged him to give some news he made a phone call and after 10 minutes the we suddenly started to board finally we left at 8pm and the flight with an a319 went fairly well bad weather is a standard inconvenience and flying with fog is not safe but the behaviour of azerbaijan airlines was simply not acceptable we were all left for hours without any information any drink and any apologize
17338,ryanair,3,im sad that ryanair didnt even try to understand situation,bought tickets from supersaver helsinki to rga and i am an old customer with ryanair always been happy with fast service until now day before flight checked email ryanair app no invite for online check in so i thought going to do like normal people check in at airport but now need to payand an adult and 2 kids check in for flight of 40 euros was 160 euros and i asked any another way as i wasnt informed in which i got told somewhere with small letter you can find info i also explained i have travelled many times with ryanair and always have got online check in but not this time and no info that you cant check in at airport computerso i send same sad disappointment about service like that to customer service and just copy paste text also the guy at desk wow i must say im surprised he works at an airport dead as dead personat the end of the day im sad that ryanair didnt even try to understand situation and pretty much copy pasted texting so i m gonna skin this company for my travel trips just because you are a cheap airline company doesnt give them the right to behave that way you should consider reducing the fee a little less especially if its a 50 min flight and price 15 euros
6894,china airlines,1,book another airline,brisbane to auckland our flight was supposed to depart at 1pm we sat on the plane until 230pm with absolutely no information or notification that the flight was delayed once they finally decided to announce the delay we were told it would be another 2 hours minimum as the plane needed to be inspected we were not allowed to get off the plane and no reimbursement was offered so we are sitting in the plane 3 hours after scheduled departure time with 0 notice reimbursement or options because the flight was delayed so long by the time we arrived in auckland it was too late to check into our accommodation which was 198 wasted when we brought this up to the staff they act like they have no idea how such a thing could happen do yourself a favor pay the little extra and book another airline to avoid the holiday nightmare that 150 of us all experiences on this joke of an airline
7906,cubana airlines,2,cubana airlines customer review,lgwhog economy class awful journey inflight entertainment nonexistent crackly dvd showing spanish cartoons and headphones system did not work seats broken and uncomfortable service very poor and could not hear any of the announcements when i signalled for a stewardess to come and speak to me i was shrugged at temperature was high in the cabin throughout flight havlgw upgraded to business class this was really worth it staff attentive and the food great the entertainment although audio still not working was better quality upgrading to business class was like upgrading to get the quality of most other airlines ive flown with in economy class
663,aigle azur,8,they could smile a bit more,berlin to paris flight on time clean and modern plane it was impossible to buy any drinks due to an issue with their visa machine the crew was ok but they could smile a bit more at orly airport we had to disembark by bus which took 10 minutes to finally be at the south terminal
10269,garuda indonesia,7,staff planes etc are very reliable,we have flown with garuda from melbourne to bali for the past 12 years twice a year over the past 5 years the staff planes etc are very reliable but the videos shown on board did not seem updated since july 2018
8089,dragonair,7,crew friendly and courteous,hong kong to hiroshima return with dragonair both flights on an a320200 the first flight had no inflight entertainment system on board not even a shared screen in the cabin the cabin was old and tired and some seats were not wellmaintained food was fairly acceptable but was nothing compared to cathay pacific fortunately the cabin crew were friendly and courteous making this flight a fairly enjoyable one the return flight was an older a320200 but with renovated cabin the cabin was smarter and more comfortable flight meal was better than the first flight interestingly we could use the aircraft wifi on our tablets to access the inflight entertainment system unfortunately there was no guidance on how to download the studio ka app when connected to the aircraft wifi and it turned out to be a 45hour flight with no inflight entertainment again cabin crew again mostly friendly and helpful i was happy with my experience with dragonair but i do not look forward to flying small aircraft eg a320 i would prefer the a330300 in the future
8293,easyjet,2,luggage rulesmeasures are very confusing,the checkin and security check was perfectly fine both processing and staff the hand luggage rulesmeasures are very confusing and are obviously created to make people pay for an extra fee also the construction of seats with a frame beneath doesnt allow regular hand luggage although this frame that might be necessary could most probably have been constructed in a different way discussing this matter with the personnel at the gate at rome fco got very emotional and wasnt professional at all
4977,avianca,1,really a disaster,no food drinks offered unless you buy it they did not have everything offered in the menu in particular no sandwichs the airport staff in miami was unfriendly no ear sets offered and you have to use your phone to use the multimedia that was not working 100 really a disaster
22696,wings air,6,cheap and the plane is new,jakarta hlp to bandung is a new route from wings air this flight only take about 22 minutes since wings air is a lcc inflight food are only available by purchasing it i dont know what are they selling maybe some snacks and there wasnt any menu card or something like that i like to fly with wings air since it is cheap and the plane is new but what i dont like is the stewardess are just little bit smile less
9931,flysafair,6,priority booking absolutely non sensical,we are extremely disappointed in the way and manner we were treated in boarding flight fa305 to cape town first the priority line and normal queues were allowed to embark at the same time which makes the priority booking absolutely non sensical when i raised what i believe was a valid complaint the ground staff merely stated my complaint will be noted i believe this treatment meted out by you to your priority clients call for a reimbursement as this conduct is incongruous to say the least i am on my way to cape town for an urgent medical procedure and my wife also had cancer which makes standing in the sun a most unpleasant experience we were allowed to leave the terminal building but then had to stand in the sun for an extended period before being allowed to embark the excuse was the number of wheelchair passengers delaying embarkation but why are we not retained in the terminal building till those passengers have been seated we have started to support safair but i will have to rethink after this incident as it never happened with any airline and i have been flying since the early 70s we book on your business class package and are then treated as second class citizens
20614,tigerair,9,i had a very pleasant experience,i had a very pleasant experience with tigerair it was only a short flight from singapore to hanoi but i was looked after and would be very happy to travel with them again what i was most impressed with was their incredibly fast reply to my recent request for them to resend my eticket from almost 2 months ago it was literally 15 minutes if that i am extremely impressed with their post flight customer service
15861,pegasus airlines,4,no one has contacted me,i bought a ticket from krasnodar to istanbul arrived at the airport and the flight was not canceled it simply does not exist the airline did not warn that the flight would not be tickets continue to be bought i also bought tickets from istanbul to dalaman which i also cannot use because i didnt fly out of krasnodar wrote a complaint to the airline at the moment no one has contacted me spent about 600 on a trip that i could not complete
21220,turkish airlines,5,this airline can be quite good,our flight out of bangkok demonstrates that this airline can be quite good the food was very good plentiful and tasty the staff on board was very friendly and efficient unfortunately the plane was so old outdated and the business class experience was very disappointing the flight istanbul to marrakech was much worse normally this route is serviced by 737800 that are quite new and nice we were very unlucky to fly on a 12 year old a321 business class was more than mediocre to make things worse the staff on board was really awful if im sure to fly on their newer planes i might give them another chance if the price of the ticket is reasonable
17887,shanghai airlines,8,shanghai airlines customer review,peksha rebooked at china eastern check in on earlier flight with shanghai airlines b757200 quite old but much legroom excellent service staff with good knowledge in english no inflight entertainment chinese newspaper in english arrival on time excellent value for money no complaints
10493,go first,2,the airline is not worth it,the airline is not worth it most of their flights are delayed they had delayed three flights continuously on 18th of march by more than 2 hours and they did not provide any sort of compensation no meal or apology they had the audacity to say sir we can refund your full amount who is gonna pay for the expense one made to come to airport and go back and book another hotel because you guys delayed someones flight by 2 hours fly with indigo instead of them
19450,swoop,1,we will never ever fly swoop,when i thought that i had a bad experience with sunwings there comes swoop we started our vacation on 13 mar 2023 flight wo0638 to cancun we waited after we boarded more than one hour on board without knowing why we dont take off it is true that the captain made an announcement but in so low voice that was hard to understand asking the flight attendant why we dont proceed to take off she was annoyed i guess and said that the captain already mentioned that i did not understand neither did my wife finally we got to cancun late more than one hour but they ran out of mexican immigration forms and we had to figure it out at our time expense adding more time to be late in the resort no complimentary anything was handed to us to compensate a bit all of this inconvenience now comes the part when we return from cancun 18 mar 2023 getting to the airport we noticed that our flight 641 has been delayed for more than 5 hours let alone the line up time for checking in please note that no email has been sent to us to let us know the flight is delayed then when weve got to the check in counter and we started to ask questions one of clerks took us on a side and issued us vouchers for the 3 of us worth 60 and we were told to check in around 2100 since the flight was delayed till after midnight but no plausible explanation has been given to us checked out the hotel at noon got to the airport around 1600 the flight was at 20 minutes past midnight so more than 12 hours wasted because some clerk in canada did not do its due diligence to send out an email when we landed in toronto we spent more than 20 minutes for the ground crew to attach the ramp because they did not have personnel to conclude we will never ever fly swoop and there is no word of lie here
11389,icelandair,6,transatlantic avoid them,this was our second icelandair go and back flight since their fleet of boeing 767 and 757 is getting old and worn out they had to find a replacement and obviously not being willing to change to airbus the only option they had was the illfated 737max which still needs to regain its reputation the last grounding was in april but now icelandair claims everything is under control this plane is just new but not more advanced inside or more comfortable than their old planes seats are leather and about the same comfort as we had many years ago on old 737s with not much recline the galleys are tiny and so is the room for the toilet cubicles the first row in economy is with more legroom but you pay extra noise level is not better than in old planes the tv screens in that first row are lowered into a pocket between the seats and the crew has to help everybody to retrieve them and pull them up the food service is typical icelandair just minimal we flew saga class last time and it was the same advice do not fly saga class the price difference is too much bring your own food cabin attendants were friendly but not extremely keen on making you feel comfortable if you need something you have to tell them pilots only announced the bare minimum they are required to ground service provided by agent at zurich was excellent as always but at keflavik it was low quality ontime performance was good but easy to achieve in low corona passenger numbers fly icelandair if you go to iceland but transatlantic avoid them the change of planes in kef is an ordeal
14434,malaysia airlines,2,not so supportive,in both inbound and outbound flight malaysia airlines was delayed i missed my connection flight to my final destination they dont have customer service in doha just a small transit office near a1 gate staff are not nice not so supportive
20959,tui airways,4,6 hour flight without ife,nicely presented recently purchased boeing 737 relatively comfortable seats decent staff and a buy on board service however a 6 hour flight without ife is hard work in addition there was only a single drinks service on the return flight and there was no effort made to allow passengers to ask for drinks
18293,singapore airlines,7,a good flight was spoiled by an awful start,check in at brisbane was the worst we have ever experienced there is only one business class counter which resulted in a 30 minute queue on taking this up with the duty manager i was told this is to push passengers to use the check in machine and deal with their own luggage fine for passengers familiar with the system but not acceptable for passengers who predate the automated era and certainly not acceptable having paid for business class having finally checked in it was another disappointment to discover that brisbane airport has abolished fast track security obviously an airport decision but it begs the question as a major user of brisbane have singapore airlines put any pressure on the airport to reintroduce this facility the lounge had a good selection of food once the flight boarded it was back to the excellent service we expect so unfortunate that a good flight was spoiled by an awful start the business class experience should begin on first arrival at the airport
22962,xiamen airlines,4,communication is not maintained,tianjin to fuzhou with xiamen airlines the airline lured us into boarding and we were kept on the aircraft for over an hour without any announcements which is shameful this airline prides itself on proving the best service in china however this has not been the case for me the basis communication between them and passengers is not maintained raising many questions of how any news being delivered in a transparent way
23045,xl airways france,8,xl airways france customer review,i booked xl airways well in advance as we were looking for a great price to fly our family of 5 from san francisco to paris in june i read all the negative reviews and decided to take a chance with this low cost operator we had an excellent experience we were prepared for delays and extra charges what we experienced was excellent cheerful service from check in to arrival the flights were efficient and on time in both directions we paid extra to check bags and get better seats but we still saved hundreds of dollars per flight if i needed water when service wasnt offered i simply went to the back and asked it was good to stretch my legs on a long flight they even fed us two meals that were included in the price the seats were uncomfortable but i was prepared for some discomfort if youre looking to save some money on a flight to europe this is a great choice
2294,air mauritius,2,do not recommend this airline,london heathrow to mauritius with air mauritius staff was helpful and friendly food was very average entertainment was very tragic this route uses the old style entertainment system which plays a set number of films on loop inflight entertainment system was old and not flexible and the screens were unclear bad quality monitors and headphones nothing was to actually see and hear the seat were uncomfortable very little legroom they lost my luggage no one knew why or where it was we waited 5 days for luggege without any information from the air mauritius what happened when we could expect it we got 2000mur ca 40 gbp as atonement but it was enough only for a swimsuit and shampoo we do not recommend this airline at all
1149,air canada,3,delays are unacceptable,on 71323 we had a flight that was supposed to depart at 535pm but was delayed 3 whole hours for some aircraft malfunction the staff did provide vouchers for food but it did not apply to all airport restaurants regardless we arrived at our destination of vancouver extremely late today on 72423 we came back to dulles dc at 420pm on time as scheduled but there was another plane at our gate and we were stuck on the airstrip for over an hour multiple people missed their flights due to this and we were frustrated to say the least although the staff and service were nice the delays are unacceptable and there needs to be more alternative planesgates

8810,estonian air,4,estonian air customer review,since the flight from london to tallinn is 2 to 3 hours not being served a full meal is not such a big problem and you can buy on board snacks at reasonable prices for what you pay you get pretty good value for money
10858,hainan airlines,9,i was pleasantly surprised,sydney to beijing via changsha i was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality i flew sydney to beijing the ground staff and flight attendants were very helpful and accomodating the person at the checkin counter offered to sit me towards the front of the plane instead of the back so i can get off quicker as i had a connection flight attendants spoke good english and their uniforms were quite lovely they gave a blanket pillow and a kit featuring a toothbrush eye shade toothpaste socks and ear plugs the movie selection was great and included recent oscar nominated films such as the shape of water the flight crew was quick to respond to my requests of water as well would definitely recommend this airline one of the best i have flown with
21098,tunisair,6,the flight was good,nice flight on tunisair from bologna to tunis cant do online checkin so got to the airport early and got a window seat checkin lady was funny so that is always nice plane boarded ontime via bus and took off early flight attendants were friendly and served a nice lunch on the 1 hour 25 minute flight plane was boeing 737600 and it was old tray table was broken in 12 and the overhead lining was coming down the back of the plane so i wasnt sure about tunisair maintenance practices but the flight was good and we landed ontime and bags were off quickly

21132,tunisair,9,tunisair customer review,lhrtun return to lhr aircraft was a320 on both legs a little old but well maintained cabin was tidy and the crew were smiling and responding to all demands pitch is ok and you are allowed to carry 20 kilos of luggage we had a choice of 3 meals on a 2 hr 45 mins flight beer is on demand and you could take whatever you want a good experience
5639,blue air,1,great customer service,clujnapoca airport to dublin airport i mention that valentina and her colleagues had great customer service we were very well treated making our experience wonderful also a good flight time im impressed and happy to schedule my next flight with blue air airline
73,adria airways,3,adria airways customer review,lgwlju in y class adria airways now offer check in on line so it was straight to security which was great boarding quick and efficient plane downgraded from crj9 to crj2 but emergency exit seat reservation honoured waited on the stand for 30 minutes with no communication from the flight deck service was nice with sandwiches hot and cold drinks cabin crew were quite robotic seems that pursers are trained not to smile under any circumstances if crew would have been bit more cheerful and communication from the flight deck bit better it would have been 4
14265,lynx air,2,unorganized and poorly run,i flew from toronto to orlando for a business trip i july when i first checked in the lady could not find the information in her system for my paid checked luggage receipt i showed her my printed copy of the paid receipt to confirm and she wouldnt initially accept it saying that it wasnt in the system and tried to make me pay again i had to basically call over a manager and argue and fight to get my bag checked the cost to check 1 bag was an extra 187 dollars when i landed in orlando my bag was lost and never arrived there was a girl at the orlando airport who was nice but wasnt really able to help me a she was a subcontracted employee that didnt work directly for lynx she took my baggage claim report and said someone would call i spent 12 days in orlando and my luggage never arrived i had to rebuy everything for my trip on the way back the flight was delayed by 3 hours which was annoying but unfortunately more common these days and we sat on the runway for about half hour waiting to get off the plane because there was a miscommunication with the agents that were suppose to meet us on the runway with the stairs to deplane it was pretty frustrating overall the airline seemed pretty unorganized and poorly run im hoping my luggage gets back to me at some point when i get home i wont be using this airline again
20954,tui airways,7,the flight was okay,the flight was okay i think it was worth the money the seats were quite comfortable the toilets were clean and the prices were quite fair the only downside was that this was a night flight and the lights were on the whole flight except takeoff and landing we did have a 3 hour delay but i believe this isnt tuis fault great airline
9441,finnair,2,i will never fly finnair again,i will never fly finnair again after a three hour delay made me miss my connecting flight they rebooked me on a flight without giving me a boarding pass and which i could not print from a kiosk forcing me to wait in a long line which caused me to miss the final flight of the day while many others on my flight got hotel vouchers i slept or didnt sleep rather overnight in the airport as there was no desk or representative to offer me any options and no support lines open now they are refusing to offer me any compensation because the combination of factors that led to the three hour delay frees them of responsibility so infuriating how heartless they are

2254,air mauritius,4,were the cheapest airline,perth to nairobi via mauritius in junejuly 2019 their checkin baggage allowance of 23kgs is a hit below the belt to say the least inflight entertainment needs a serious upgrade as movies and tv shows were outdated cabin crew were friendly but most of them mainly spoke in french they were the cheapest airline at that time of the year and they offered 2 free nights at hennessy park hotel during transit because they have limited flights to nairobi
17945,shenzhen airlines,5,standing during turbulence,ive been taking shenzhen airlines frequently and the experience today in zh9149 was not as good as usual during the flight a woman from economy class went to the first class area and sit by me chatting with a guy and a kid who sat in the same row with me most of the time she was standing in the aisle even during turbulence even worse she used mobile phone to take pics for the kid this behavior is dangerous and it happened at least three times during the flight but there was no cabin crew stopping her all the time
14817,monarch airlines,4,not impressed at all,gatwick to sharm el sheikh with monarch airlines cabin crew worked hard but dirty plane dirty all round the seat and chewing gum in the seat pockets when i told the cabin crew member she offered me baby wipes what about moving me to a clean seat or wasnt there a clean seat available not impressed at all i paid more for this ticket than i did in may to travel to dubai with emirates who were outstanding even in economy

5580,berjaya air,8,berjaya air customer review,small airline but a good one despite heavy turbulence on the flight from kuala lumpurs old airport to tioman island i felt safe and that the fas knew what to do in the event of an emergency cant be sure of course but it felt that way good information from the crew about the turbulence small planes but comfortable for the relatively short flight good service during the flight

8427,edelweiss air,7,edelweiss air customer review,not sure if it is a charter or schedule airline travelled genevaheraklion return excellent both ways friendly staff a nice lunch on way out questionable on return as a matter of personal conscious i do not eat veal however a bite of the sausage on return leg made me question its ingredients to find it was veal they should have informed pax prior to service so we had a choice to refuse other than that pretty faultless flights
13015,korean air,4,hardware was very dated,seoul to kuala lumpur new aircraft but hardware was very dated seat is trueflat but not comfortable in partially reclined position it provides no armrests tray table is unsupported and slants when the when the food tray is placed on it a laptop will gradually slide off unless constantly repositioned window seats in the upper deck are more spacious than aisles which are constricted by walls and offer zero storage space accessible from the seat the partition between seats is just plain awkward barely enough space to balance a drink precariously without deploying the slanted table pillow and blanket are economy standard and not appropriate for overnight flights ife is substandard with few choices service is mediocre hampered by poor english attendants have their rote routine but cannot cope with anything spontaneous like a change of wine with main course water refills out of the designated timeframe or drinks outside of regular service timesthey are very polite but this does not translate into effective service ground staff at the prestige checkin desk lack even this basic politeness again possibly because of a lack of linguistic skills in english wine selection is excellent but food is quite simply the worst ive had in a premium cabin of a full service carrier

20412,thomas cook airlines scandinavia,2,thomas cook airlines scandinavia customer review,heltfshel with a321 efficient checkin very simple and small prepaid hot meal for a 7 hrs flight meal should be more filling two very different flights outbound flight had a professional and attentive service inbound flight had a rude and unhelpful crew we were sitting on exit row 11 no smiles at all and they intend to sell everything too many disturbing announcements when you are trying to read and relax seats were dirty and showing their age what is also annoying return flights from canary islands to finland are almost always late with this airline not worth for the money as we paid expensive flight tickets only

9058,eurowings,1,worst airline ever,worst airline ever the flight from frankfurt to cancun which was eurowings a subgroup of lufthansa was horrible firstly the flight was delayed more than an hour secondly they gave us 1 meal over the whole 12 hours 1 meal then a cookie just before the end i was not even given a choice of meal i was just given pasta with a pathetic amount of tomato sauce they also made the cabin freezing me and the girl sat next to me were shivering they dont give you blankets in economy they charge you 8 euros for a blanket and obviously you have to buy it the staff were so unhelpful and so rude i asked to sit near to the exit during landing so that i could run off quickly and hopefully make the connection and no staff would help me no one cared they just said whatever i cant help the whole vibe of the staff was uncaring rude and abrupt the movie selection was also abysmal

12985,korean air,4,this airline was disappointing,i flew out from brisbane stopover at seoul before continuing to my destination japan tokyo during this 13 hour trip i found this airline to the most disappointing so far in my travels i have previously flown with cathay thai and malaysia and theyve been pretty good cathay being the best in my opinion this airline was disappointing because they always skimp on the water levels in their cups given out every time im on a plane that is the last thing that i need to be even more dehydrated to those people thinking of flying you are better off buying your own bottle of water before you go seats were uncomfortable and at a weird angle for that reason i highly recommend choosing a different airline for long distance travel seats were also quite compact and not spacious inflight entertainment was average and on one of the planes its remote control was stuck to the screen with a wire what i mean by that is that everytime your window seat buddy needed to go to the toilet and needed to pass me in the aisle seat the wire was in the way making it a clumsy design food was very average never going to fly korean air again
18475,skywest airlines,3,skywest airlines customer review,i am a regular flyer but only had my first experience with skywest last week on a flight from milwaukee to laguardia unfortunately i have to say it was the worst experience i have had with an airline i booked the flight via delta who did not include baggage in the ticket price and would not allow me to pay for this immediately i had to wait until it was time to check in very inconvenient they then proceeded to rescheduled the time of the flight about four times as a result i had to call them to reschedule to a later flight which resulted in my missing several hours of my nyc vacation the later flight took off as scheduled but was very old and had the smallest seats i have ever seen and i am a small person safety is clearly not a priority for this airline as the flight attendants did not explain what to do in case of an emergency and by checking the safety card i discovered there were no life vests or life rafts on board in the event of us landing on water we were to use the seat cushions to stay afloat considering this flight crossed lake michigan and lake erie and flew over the atlantic before landing at laguardia i find it baffling that they would even consider not having life vests on board
18678,south african airways,4,not willing to help,sao paulo to hong kong via johannesburg i had a okay flight from so paulo to johannesburg even tho the food experience was not good at all my flight from johannesburg to hong kong was canceled after we waited 3 hours inside of the plane for technical problems fixing apparently the aircraft had less then 50 air pressure and it was insufficient to a flight over 12 hours we had to wait inside of the airplane for 3 hours without airconditioning just so they end up telling us that the flight is cancelled and we would flight the next day they provided hotel but my flight was over 24 hours after they could have changed aircraft or being nicer to costumers that were in the delayed flight instead i had to keep calling them for information about when i would flight and got very rude attitude from the staff i wanted to upgrade my flight from economy to business due to being 6 months pregnant they were not willing to help and were very inefficient even tho i was paying for the upgrade the last problem was that i had a connecting flight in hk and they said they were unable to check my luggage straight to the final destination so i would have to check out in hk get my luggage and check in again with the spare time of 1 hours between flights

6992,china eastern airlines,7,i would fly china eastern again,colombo to toronto via beijing i was more than happy with the level of service quality of flight and meals etc boarding was done efficiently for a full flight i think it was done in record time the b777 j class has full lieflat seats with ample space and amenities the pvgcmb leg was on an a330 with podtype seats in j class which were not lieflat and i had the constant feeling that i was going to slide off the front of the seat the ife and software is a little stunted for someone with no knowledge of chinese there are some issues with dual language naturally the base language is chinese but the software has not been translated fully into english and is a little difficult to navigate there is also an online food ordering system which was not in service at the time there was no problem with the meals i chose the chinese cuisine the timings of the meal service was unusual though i thought it was later than most carriers would do it i thought the cabin crew worked well and communicated fine despite the language barrier i would have liked to see another couple of rounds of beverage offered one complaint which others have mentioned before on the outbound yyzpvg leg there were five occasions where the smell of cigarette smoke wafted around the cabin during the flight i would fly china eastern again

8640,el al israel airlines,8,experience on the 787 was great,newark to tel aviv in june 2018 and return in august 2018 on the boeing 787 checkin at ewr was smooth after the compulsory security interrogation i strongly recommended one arrives 3 hours if flying el al in order to complete the checkin process my interrogation lasted 10 minutes and it helped i was traveling with a group to israel everything on the plane both ways looked brand new and the ife was fantastic and stateoftheart flight attendants were friendly and attentive and responded quickly to call button requests food two meals on both flights were edible and alright chose the chicken dish on both legs and it was alright dairybreakfast meal was a choice of blintzes or an omelet on both flights as well chose the blintzes both times they were nothing special but i was full from the previous meal checkin at tel aviv once past the initial security interrogation was fairly quick my seat was assigned at the gate although they termed it as standby which makes me wonder if they didnt expect me to be on the plane due to extra security searches of my bags i can only guess that at the tlv gate approached the desk to get a seat assignment as the flight was boarding the first lady i approached hardly looked at the computer and my ticket and said it wasnt ready i waited 15 minutes and without any announcement coming about standby passengers i approached a different gate agent who promptly assigned me a seat they could not fulfill my request for an aisle seat but the gate agent was gracious with his apology on the return flight i was seated next to an unaccompanied minor and the flight attendant was very attentive toward him asking how he was and if he needed anything during the flight el al does have online checkin but its useless if you are checking bags or have to go through extra security procedures overall however the experience on the 787 was great and i did not mind the extra security situations that come with flying el al that said im not sure if id want to fly on them on some of the older aircraft

5553,belavia,2,onboard service is nonexistent,flew from minsk to kiev borispol as a frequent traveler on belavia i do around 510 flights monthly with them my overall opinion is that they are the most primitive legacy airline ive ever used even downhill from low cost all the aircrafts are ancient and have no standard seat layout legroom is tight another negative point the onboard service is nonexistent and is limited to 1 glass of water still or carbonated thats the choice if you opt to buy food or drink dont bother they do not exist on sale it is also a bad idea to buy socalled business class ticket you will be seated into economy and given same glass of water the only reasons i use them are that the schedule exactly fits my needs there is almost no choice on routes i fly all my flights are up to 75 minutes and they are always on time

2260,air mauritius,2,we tried to be compensated,london to mauritius in march 2019 flight was cancelled last minute and we took off only the next day we lost a full day and when we tried to be compensated no answer it took 4 months before they came back to me saying im sorry we can do anything but next time you can have access to the salon i was business class so i always have access to the salon and priority check in and i wont go back there food was average comfort below average the only positive was the service on board
20916,transavia,6,crew was pleasant,heraklion to eindhoven flight landed on time seats are very cramped on the newer airplanes of transavia no ife on board crew was pleasant and correct prices for food and drinks weer average
10811,hainan airlines,1,cabin crew were very friendly,brisbane to shenzhen my first time on hainan check in staff were helpful the flight was smooth with little turbulence cabin crew were very friendly and greeted everyone as they entered the plane service throughout the flight was excellent especially the female lead cabin manager who assisted me when my first meal choice was unavailable she later came back to check on me to make sure i was happy and satisfied and took my order for the second meal service in advance what a star my seat was comfortable and inflight entertainment was good i had a high expectation before departure and was very happy that i chose hainan airlines
22011,vistara,5,crew members are amazingly well mannered,i had a flight today at 650pm from bangalore to delhi and reached the boarding pass counter after long queue outside the airport and managed to be there by 551 pm i had boarding pass in my hand just wanted to submit my luggage i asked 3 staff member of vistara team if i am too late and every one said mam you will catch the flight but one staff was rude he just didnt want to even listen clearly telling me you cant means cant and i literally begged them and made them understood if i leave my luggage and rush to the gate i will be able to catch the flight but it was clear that even if your staff was trying he simply wanted to be rude i begged every staff member who were kind enough and have a logical reply to rush to the gate and leave my luggage and by 625 i was in the aircraft and even after me 3 more people boarded your crew members are amazingly well mannered but that guy wasnt rest of the staff was super kind thanks
6604,cathay pacific airways,2,male staff refused my request,as a marco polo member for many years i have never experienced such service from cathay before as frequent flyer this is the worst ever situation that happened frankly its just a minor request i just wanted a cup of hot water after many hours of flying the male staff refused my request replying that he was too busy inside i was fuming but didnt want to make a scene on flight so returned to my seat without anything
2426,air namibia,3,not a care in the world,lusaka to cape town via windhoek i booked this ticket on line about 4 weeks before the departure date i had to phone the air namibia call center after booking as i received a confirmation email but not the eticket the night before the departure around 2000 i received a call from air namibia informing me the flight had been cancelled due to an operational issue most likely not enough booked passengers i was given the option of being rebooked on any of the daily flights on south african airways to johannesburg and then air namibia to windhoek i chose the 1325 flight and was told to pop into their office at the airport to collect my new ticket as it would be waiting for me unfortunately it wasnt and it took three hours of sitting around and a final mad rush to board ever walked onto a plane where everyone has been sitting waiting to see what idiot has held up the flight anyway to cut it short a journey that should have been 4 hours check in and flight time ended up being 11 hours air namibia not a care in the world
19674,tam airlines,3,service is absolutely poor,the service offered by tam is absolutely poor the booking process is difficult particularly if you are a foreigner and hasnt got the tam fidelidade and on top of it if you select a different language you pay a higher or lower price and also its pricing policy is confusing changing almost on a daily basis despite the fact that you are flying from and to the same airport it does not give you the possibility to select a proper meal if you hold their frequent flyer card and you fly in economy class eventually you risk not have food for you as generally they run out to the choices offering you the left over that happened to me twice this year because i tend to seat back at the end their inflight entertainment is not far from the other airlines although their touch screen hardly works forget about duty free they apply rates in usd despite the fact the brazilian currency is real much cheaper therefore the exchange rate applied is exorbitant the crew is okay but some of them give out the impression to be afraid to speak out
1073,air berlin,4,worst flight experiences,miami to dusseldorf on air berlin one of the worst flight experiences the seat is the most squeezed i have flown similar to easyjet but long haul service is ordinary befitting a cheap airline air berlin fails to recognize oneworld partner elite membership for extra seating which is offered only to their members while aa offers to partners check in staff knows nothing about lounge but the aa miami lounge turned out to be the only good thing on this trip the fare is cheap but false economy aa is much better
878,air astana,9,air astana customer review,delhi to almaty return our group was more than 20 passengers travelling to almaty from delhi on 10th sept we were very impressed with the inflight service and the personal touch one of the air hostesses also welcomed us both in hindi and english our groups return journey was on 17th september from almaty to delhi which was again very comfortable and the service was extremely good
4877,avelo airlines,3,ridiculously not customer friendly,its cheap the employees must be bound by strict policies because they seem like nice people its ridiculously not customer friendly im on a mostly empty flight but to switch seats costs 54 they strictly enforce the checked bag which cost more than the ticket at 50 pounds one way they didnt say anything about my backpack the same backpack on the way back they want to charge me for a carry on the advertised price is not the price your enjoyment of the flight is not their priority but i gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because its cheap if the prices ever increase id avoid them like the plague
16508,qantaslink,7,qantaslink customer review,first time on the early service hbamel since the change from a jet to a dash8 q400 it was about half an hour slower but otherwise was fine staff friendly and the food pack edible dont agree with what used to be the busiest qantas flight out of hobart being downgraded to a turboprop
22161,vivaaerobs,7,i am generally pleased with their service,never had any issues with viva aerobus the new website and app are miles better than the old ones they do still seem to have a problem sending sms push notifications when your flight is delayed however as does their competitor volaris unsure what gives with that the checkin staff and cabin crew were very nice i think if you pay for the flexi package you certainly get your moneys worth especially being able to skip the checkin queues which can take an hour sometimes for a low cost carrier i am generally pleased with their service
15549,onur air,3,seat comfort is good,check in process on line was straighforward flight delayed leaving istanbul by over 1 hour ground crew at the airport were quite unhelpful after takeoff a trolley seemed to roll out of its position in the galley and made a very loud crash as did a smaller metal box this is the first time i have ever seen a cabin attendant get out of her seat whilst the aircraft was at such a steep angle for most of the flight a trolley was placed in front of the entry to the galley so the front toilet was not accessible other than this it was an acceptable flight food is for purchase only quality was as to be expected for paid food on a short flight the seat comfort is good as they are quite padded compared to other airlines
22995,xiamen airlines,5,xiamen airlines customer review,sinxmn return basically a domestic airlines food quality very basic poor inflight entertainment worst of all no smiles on the faces of the cabin crew not up to standard for international flight
9606,flair airlines,5,fly with minimal luggage,i recently flew with flair from edmonton to toronto i have flown with flair 4 or 5 times now on similar routes across the country if you can fly with minimal luggage ie smaller than a full size carryon bag and you value saving money over pretty much everything else in the air travel experience than flair can be great they offer budget flight costs and deliver reliable budget flight experiences if you need to carry luggage andor you want any amenities at all you are going to end up paying more or being disappointed i would recommend shopping around as i have had flights with west jet and air canada that were as cheap or close to a flair flight youll get a much better travel experience with those airlines that said i will fly flair again when their fares are significantly lower than the major airline options staff has been friendly and professional planes are clean flights have been mostly on schedule cheap fares cabins are cramped and older styles serviceamenities are limited or absent youll pay for anything extra you want including a carry on bag
16472,qantaslink,7,the flight was decent,it was a short a flight from brisbane to gladstone with qantaslink the flight was decent and acceptable both the ground staff and the cabin crew were polite passengers were served with coffee and a roast beef sandwich the later was good but the coffee wasnt the seats didnt look very good in my opinion finally these aircraft dash 8 are so noisy and they give you a headache regardless of the short time on board
10060,french bee,1,very bad flight experience,terrible crew terrible food and very bad flight experience avoid at all cost cheap ticket is one thing being taken for a fool as a customer is not acceptable
21106,tunisair,1,no interest in serving,london to tunis return at the moment the only way to get to tunisia is with tunisair we found most flight attendants to be very rude and showed no interest in serving us i asked for a cup of tea 5 times and was completely ignored i tried to book a vegetarian meal without success and when i asked if they had a vegetarian meal was told curtly no we have flown with them 4 times in six months and each time have found the service to be shocking staff should have customer care training as their attitude to work is dreadful
1454,air china,4,catered for chinese passengers,copenhagen to beijing via stockholm premium economy ticket purchased through agent which means that you cannot use air china website to check in manage booking etc beforehand so we were assigned seats at check in air china website has very limited info on what you get for premium economy more legroom but nothing else the first leg was with sas plus which provided all the details so we were able to take advantage of priority queues and lounge access at copenhagen which was excellent when we transferred at stockholm we were not permitted access to air china lounge or any extra services food on plane was standard and not very appetizing we had an additional air china flight beijing hong kong which was delayed due to weather with no information from ac on reasons why return flight hgkpekcph was ok but nothing to get excited about cabin crew did a professional job in flight media was hopeless it is controlled from remote fixed into arm rest and is very small in size and buttons are difficult to access it was very difficult to select items and i often hit call attendant by mistake most programmes catered for chinese passengers with limited up to date western movies or music overall despite cheaper prices than competitors i dont think premium economy is worth the extra by contrast i wish we had flown sas premium economy the whole way
13842,lion air,4,usual nonexisting service,being rebooked on this flight i was not really thrilled by the option given as definitely lion air isnt my favourite airline one of the reasons is the poor seatpitch one gets must admit i was pleased to get an emergency exit seat with lots of place to stretch out moreover i was excited to fly on a boeing 737900er which is not common though lion air has many of them with the usual nonexisting service nor offer to sell onboard i noticed an elevated number of flight attendants though flight was quite turbulent we landed safely
20028,thai airways,2,the service is second rate,we paid for premium economy as thai call this full flex expecting something a bit better than basic economy nothing was any different except baggage allowance change ticket fees seats food etc were the very same this was very disappointing anyway for our return flight my wife suggested that we change our seats to a bulk head in front because of more leg room although we paid through the nose they still wanted another gbp 7880 each i contacted thai airways about this on january 25th as i write february 26th no reply i would advise anyone do not fly thai because the service is second rate and prices are high
7943,cyprus airways,3,no online check in available,thessaloniki to larnaca there was no online check in available for me and if you come earlier to airport you have to wait first in order for the check in to open and then second for check in queue
14441,malaysia airlines,2,i had to pay for excess baggage,food was average with flight service being par as well the most disappointing part was the check in service counter where i had to pay for excess baggage the representative was charging me 15usd extra per kg compared to the price shown on the official website of the airline upon asking why the representative said he does not know and i should take it up with the airline which was highly unprofessional i ended up paying 75usd extra for my excess baggage compared to the price i should have paid as per the airlines website
11964,jeju air,4,not good value for money,flew jeju air from seoul to saipan queuing for hours in incheon seoul airport i almost missed my flight although i was at the airport 4 hours prior the departure time the matter is that as a holder of foreign passport i cant use check in kiosk an airlines staff should verify that im in possession of all necessary documents to go to us territory the flight itself was quite smooth but all window blinds should be closed maybe because of north korea i dont know theres no meal but you could buy some beverages and snacks a very limited assortment considering that my one way ticket costs almost 300 us its not good value for money
2150,air malta,2,priority boarding and seat were lost,changed my return flight with air malta this can only be done by phone but the guy on the phone must have made a mistake because my booking code was faulty i could not log in and i was not on the passenger list also my priority boarding and seat were lost this could not be corrected by phone had to be done on the airport so both on going out and the return flight i had a problem air maltas check in desks and supervisor treated me like it was somehow my fault no apologies or anything just 45 minutes of hassle upon check in and no priority available even though i could prove i paid for it they did put me in the passenger list again reluctantly so finally i did go to malta and back again
17717,scoot,1,no commercial gesture from them,they changed our flight which was scheduled for 400 pm to an 815 am flight we had no commercial gesture from them because of this schedule we couldnt buy any food at the airport because everything opened at 8am on a 635 flight no free drink or food offered they forced us to pay for a place to be next to the children 30 when in my opinion it should be automatic
11383,icelandair,6,we had two negative experiences,our flight from boston was ok but we had two negative experiences with icelandair the airport in reykjavk was overcrowded and there was zero effort to keep people socially distanced although there was room to do so our second issues was their association with global rental car which we booked on their website the company as it turns out has terrible reviews and justifiably so global rental car requires a deposit to rent a vehicle and buried in the fine print you do not get back the deposit no matter how soon you cancel in our case three months in advance and only days after booking the rental we canceled due to the awfully negative reviews there was no phone number to call and when you click on the cancellation button you have no choice but to agree to an additional fee no other iceland rental car company that we found wanted a deposit icelandair should vet the vendors that they choose to place on their website
4805,austrian airlines,4,horrible check in experience,great flying but a horrible check in experience very rude woman at the desk in innsbruck who seemed bothered to help me and barely said hello there was no line of people in front of me and i was the only one checking in at the moment
8237,eastern airways,4,eastern airways customer review,first time on eastern stansted to manchester return excellent aircraft and service however only four passengers on board going up and twelve coming back in a 29 seater reason i suspect is cost could have flown to dubai and back cheaper i hope they survive as they are something different but eastern must look at their pricing structure
17158,rwandair,2,poor efforts to retrieve luggage,delayed luggage and poor efforts to retrieve luggage i boarded a rwandair flight from dubai to lagos on 14th may and on arrival my luggage was delayed today is 20th may and i am not connected with my luggage despite several calls and emails i had to purchase most of the items in my box because i was arriving for my marriage this was after a combined 5 hours delay at dubai 3 hours after technical issues with plane and 2 hours in kigali during the connecting flight
10923,hawaiian airlines,1,leaving all competition in the dust,leaving all competition in the dust despite being a single aisle aircraft hawaiian delivers on this route great seats and legroom are accompanied by warm efficient service warm greetings and consistent attention really make the difference they served a very good substantial warm lunch with a separate dessert course fas were constantly making rounds offering top offs etc only negative is no wi fi compared to the competitionwell there is none tired of the tight spaces and dour faces on the other carriers
1408,air china,6,no premium economy on this flight,beijing to san francisco i buy a premium economy ticket on the return flight from beijing to sfo they print my boarding pass and arriving on board i realize this is coach i inquire and they say no premium economy on this flight i presume they changed the equipment i call air china to obtain a refund of the price difference now they say you have to call beijing they have my flight coupons and itinerary what else do they need this is an example in how to make it difficult for a customer to obtain a legitimate refund its a shame as the flight itself was not disastrous the la based call center agent finally sorted my case and i received a refund she called me back several times to keep me informed i felt this was a good recovery from a rather negatively engaged case
18098,silkair,6,functional but lacked much polish,silkair from singapore to yangon was noticeably inferior to my outbound singapore airlines flight the seats are tightly packed resulting in minimal legroom and were not particularly comfortable no avod but entertainment screened on the communal video screens food was okay and a choice of wine or beer was served cabin crew were professional and polite but lacked enthusiasm overall everything was functional but lacked much polish
13829,libyan airlines,3,libyan airlines customer review,tripoli to manchester the plane took off an hour late so not a great start but once onboard there were no problems staff friendly food was ok a bit too many sweets and the seats were comfortable enough all in all an ok experience its by far the cheapest option to get to manchester so ill probably be using it again in the future
19744,tam airlines,2,tam airlines customer review,jj3558 igugru 16 oct 2013 fly this route usually every month tam is dropping the quality of service and it shows should be considered a low cost airline and not a standard airline at check in we were almost forced to do self check in seats with more space are sold separately and until last month they served a mini sandwich with 3 choices of cold drinks no coffee or hot tea now a small bag of peanuts
14445,malaysia airlines,1,mh has improved drastically,i found overall mh has improved drastically with their ground handling checkin was super smooth the inflight demonstration video is refreshing and modern quality of food has improved flights were punctual the aircraft were cleaned and the cabin crew were great in personality i was happy with their service

9255,fastjet,2,terrible experience,i recently flew on fastjet from johannesburg to harare the flight was delayed by almost an hour due to technical issues on the aircraft they made us wait for almost one hour in the bus while they fixed the aircraft i did not feel safe at all while flying and i was extremely disappointed while up in the air the aircraft was making a really strange squeaky noise which was very unsettling considering that the aircraft had some sort of technical issues terrible experience overall would not recommend at all
8985,etihad airways,3,disappointed with the schedule changes,very disappointed with the schedule changes my flights were changed 5 to 6 times after i had booked finally i rebooked a flight with them and the flight got delayed after i took the first leg i am not sure if they are attracting day tourists by doing this
8673,emirates,7,a hit or miss airline,i decided to fly emirates again after having a very unfortunate first experience with them a few years ago well what i can tell now from 4 flights with them is that they are a hit or miss airline some crew members will be friendly and professional others on the same flight will be rude and careless what others have mentioned on these reviews is true they will run out of meals option easily and you will have to settle with leftovers if you are seated at the rear i have noticed the aircrafts are becoming very overused some had broken features and a funny smell the food is very basic if compared to other premium airlines i would say emirates is still a viable option if the price is right and they offer a lot of connections but they are not my first choice airlines if other middle eastern carriers are in the game
4404,ana all nippon airways,1,best airline i have been on,ana is the best airline i have been on the staff are amazing the food is good for airplane food the reason they are amazing is because the seats were nice the cabin and bathroom clean and there were no delays at all the safety video was in japanese and english with subtitles in both languages we were in economy on departure and in premium economy coming back the seats in economy and premium economy had a foot paddle and the seat was comfortable and recline was good the entertainment was pretty good with lots of new movies like endgame spiderman far from home and godzilla the lounge in tokyo haneda welcomes business and premium economy passengers which lots of airlines dont do and only welcome business class passengers the food was good and the lounge staff were so polite every time you walked past them they would say kon ban wa so i highly recommend ana its a great airline
10271,garuda indonesia,8,it was a pleasant journey,singapore to kupang via jakarta onboard ga829 and ga448 the checkin as well as the boarding process was smooth and the staff was efficient and helpful the cabin crew for both flight were nice and kind for the in flight entertainment the touch screen was responsive but quite slow and the movie content was not so uptodate the food was okay both flights arrived on time and there was no delay in the luggage as well overall it was a pleasant journey
14616,mann yadanarpon airlines,7,very friendly cabin,nyaung u to mandalay booked this flight a few months in advance and due to a change in their schedule i was changed to another flight of them without any notice as i checked about two weeks in advance however this flight was never going to reach mandalay made contact with them in order to change me on a different flight and they just send me a mail to reconfirm my change mailed again and was finally placed on the correct flight this took about three days to adjust early flight from bagan to mandalay which is just 78 miles far chaotic boarding by old bus but welcomed to a very friendly cabin while the cabin was about 14 full from a previous flight with passengers that were going to continue with us to mandalay choose a free seat no seats assigned to you after the safety briefing we quickly departed to mandalay which was barely 25 minutes long barely any service provided by any cabin too short of a flight but were served some candy landed ahead of time and bus to terminal which took about 10 minutes for our luggage to arrive
7486,copa airlines,4,my seat had been changed,this flight happened almost 3 months ago and they switched my seat last minute i paid for premium seats in the 5th row in a window seat upon boarding i was notified that my seat had been changed i had to wait for a new boarding pass while almost everyone else boarded the plane as the attendant was busy scanning everyone else in and having issues printing my pass so she had to just write the new seat on my existing pass they switched me to the emergency exit row in the aisle seat i watched to see who got my seat and it was a lady with a small child and children arent allowed in the exit row so i figured thats why also their stupid site can have programs in place to notify of seat issues when choosing seats for kids this ruined my experience by 80 i had really looked forward to the views from the window leaving my country behind and the views upon entering a new one things wouldve been even worse if i had to join a customs line after that specific flight but luckily i didnt have to just a disappointment because i paid extra
263,aer lingus,5,dont get how much the quality of service differs,i just dont get how much the quality of service differs i flew out to lisbon on tuesday and back today i booked the aer space seat and was really impressed with the quality of the lovely cabin crew on my flight to lisbon they offered me drinks and a snack today however was a different story and on my return leg in the same aer space seat was good except a crew person who was not shall we say as lovely as the former crew said person didnt even offer me the snack and only when i asked if i could have it they said it wasnt much so not impressed
18356,sky airline,9,crew was attentive,i flew from santiago de chile to punta arenas sky airline offers only economy class seating the fight from santiago to punta arenas makes a regular but short stop in puerto montt for a lowcost airline compared to south american standards sky airline was quite good the crew was attentive throughout the flight the pilot even mentioned when we flew over the famous torres del pain national park in patagonia we were served drinks on both legs of the flight seat comfort is okay for short to medium distances also they dont have any ife or wifi connection available on their airbus fleet however i would definitely fly again with sky airline since its great value for money
2729,air serbia,7,my bid was not successful,i made an offer to upgrade to business but received no email to inform me if my bid was successful or not when i checked in it was confirmed my bid was not successful but i was given an emergency exit seat which is good the flight was 2 hours and 20 minutes late and when i boarded i realised the plane was a type that has no business class at all in my opinion there were too few bids for upgrade to business class so the airline decided to switch the plane to one without a business class despite it arriving two hours or so later the plane itself was clean and onboard service was good
743,air arabia,3,a horrendous experience,i recently flew from ahemdabad gujarat india to tbilisi georgia by air arabia and the experience was so horrible the ground staff was so rude i had 30 kg allowance and 10 kg cabin bag i had 9 kg in my cabin bag and laptop in hand bag i was trying to add extra baggage from 3 days prior to my flight there was no option where i could add extra baggage i called up the call centre and even the lady was so rude she told me the flight is booked i asked her if what if im told at the check in to lay for my extra baggage to which she replied i dont know so this clearly means the flight was not booked and the customer service so nicely lied this is not the first time it happened i was travelling from tbilisi to ahemdabad in june2022 and i was faced with the same issue i wanted to add extra baggage and there was no option to add and when i called up the call centre they said the flight is booked this is not the way to treat the customers this is such a bad service i was holding my medical book in my hand i told them i have to study in the flight they did not let me carry the book they made me weigh my laptop bag and my cabin bag they asked me to pay for my laptop bag the airport price for per kg is 1300 inr which is comparatively eay too expensive than online prices they clearly only wanted to loot us customers when i told the checkin authorities about it they clearly blamed me that im lying i showed them my student residency card telling them that im a student and i need my book they didnt listen to anything no airline checks the laptop bag yet they do this to us everytime i tried explaining them so much no one was ready to listen it was a horrendous experience i would not suggest anyone to travel from this airline and especially if you are travelling from ahemdabad gujarat id suggest you not to take this airline the staff is obnoxious and illmannered

22884,wow air,2,luggage however did not arrive,we flew from amsterdam schiphol to keflavik and we stayed in iceland one week our luggage however did not arrive with the same flight to our destination and in fact never made it to iceland it was sent to us 8 days later and only when we contacted airport staff the staff of wow apparently could not do what we did 1 day after our arrival in the netherlands in order to find our luggage so we ended up with no personal items for a week instead they did whatever was possible in order not to find our luggage they filed it as yellow while we told them it was red they put the wrong contact information in their online system and they customer service people were asking for the same information regarding the luggage every time we called for the status apart from that the plane seats were quite uncomfortable and everything served during the flight was overpriced

22860,wow air,4,good if you travel with a backpack,london to toronto via reykjavik i have flown wow many times more than a dozen and have no problem with flying with them however this is the first time i have checked my bags what a hassle firstly what i paid for the bag when added to the flight would have gotten me on a better airline which included checked bags secondly i checked in 24 hours before the flight but couldnt check my bag until 3 hours before the flight which meant i had to stay in the airport lobby for 8 hours i couldnt go to the departures area until the bag was checked in i have checked in bags in turkey hong kong and london sooner than 3 hours before a flight surely wow is as advanced as air asia and turkish airlines and i didnt have to pay for the bag if you are going to charge almost as much for a bag as the flight you have to offer convenience and service only good if you travel with a backpack

22956,xiamen airlines,9,boeing 7878 was new,seattle to shenzhen checkin was quick boarding commenced slightly late but was controlled and orderly the boeing 7878 was new and a bit squeaky the seat had a 17 inch width and 3233 inches of pitch the seat had a cup holder remote usb and ac power ports and a fairly large personal screen the selection of content was decent but a lack of western movies and appealing eastern movies could be improved the food served was good and a decent portion was served the crew were quite sincere and attentive to all calls their english was okay for interactions but not too great over the pa
4614,asiana airlines,5,several kgs overweight,chitose to jakarta via incheon the airline refuse to take 1 luggage for 2 people because it is several kgs overweight instead they charge passenger im disappointed at this airline the food is so so flight cabin is so so
17435,sa express,5,sa express customer review,second time on sa express again impressed by speed at boarding and getting away really like the feature of putting your excess hand luggage on a trolley as you board skycheck and receiving it as you get off the plane delayed one hour due to technical issues from jburg to east london delays constantly communicated and mentioned onboard too the flight was a tale of 2 hostesses one rude obnoxious and obviously hated her job could i sit on this seat no the other friendly engaging delightful apologizing for only having one choice of white wine available i remain impressed of the free beverage they serve on short domestic flights luggage out within 5 minutes off the plane good journey let down by one attendant

1484,air djibouti,5,okay was our general impression,hargeisa to djibouti air djibouti operates one single boeing 737500 leased with crew from a company in tajikistan as well as reportedly a few smaller aircraft we flew from hargeisa to djibouti in november the plane had arrived from mogadishu with a delay but landed in jib almost on time it was definitely at least 25 years old but appeared to be in a very good state of repair seats were tight but comfortable catering consisted of a single bottle of water which was ok on this 40min hop okay was also our general impression
8233,eastern airways,5,eastern airways customer review,have flown eastern quite a few occasions now and always found them informative efficient and friendly prices are a bit high although i travel on business and do not pay myself
19565,tway air,5,with uncomfortable seat,i flew with their domestic flight from jeju island south korea to gimpo domestic airport tway has been keep on changing their departure gate three times due to flight delayed about 1 12 hour cabin crews were quite attentive and good throughout the flight but their cabin was quite disappointing small leg room with uncomfortable seat cabin looked old and aged no food or drink serve due to budget airlines and short flight 1 hour nothing else special about this airline may consider other budget domestic flight eg jeju air east starjet air busan
19207,sun country airlines,2,never fly this airline again,if you have a physical disability do not expect any help from these people i am a wheelchair user and this was my first time flying since becoming disabled so i was already nervous we received 210 assistance getting to my seat when we landed a flight attendant clapped her hands and said chop chop time to get to work to my mother to assemble my chair and received no assistance obtaining parts from the overhead compartment coming back to florida we relied on other very nice passengers to hold the flow of people moving so we could get off my mother had to carry 2 large carryon bags a purse and wheelchair seats and handles all the way to the gate entrance with no help the attendants coming home were very nice but should have at the very least held the flow of passengers getting off we will never fly this airline again
6241,bulgaria air,1,reputation and customers is not what you value,booked a flight for 12102020 and today a day before i receive the cancellation of the flight this year it has happened to me multiple times and i had to spend a fortune on buying new tickets to finally fly away none of the airlines i used ever refunded money so far and today i am in the same situation again when none of the airline reps can clearly explain what is going on how long this is going to continue covid is the reason are we going to use it as an excuse everytime and everywhere how come that overnight everything so of a sudden changes today is safe tomorrow is dangerous presumably according to the logic of the airlines why if its so you simply don t sell tickets and dont fool people into spending their hard earned money into something that is not guaranteed if you cannot refund straight away and its a shame that 6 months wasnt enough for you to come up with some kind of solution for this then i believe your reputation and customers is not what you value of course i can make it my last flight this year or even next i think its time for some changes from the customers side this is ridiculous
21556,uzbekistan airways,6,disorganised boarding,tashkent to istanbul disorganised boarding passengers were not called by rows it was a free for all with a long queue good cabin service limited options for entertainment only 3 or 4 films available no music etc
7536,copa airlines,9,economy extra seats are worth the extra cost,airport counter staff and cabin crew were polite and helpful the sfo to pty flight was delayed by less than 1 hour and upon arrival at pty passengers with connections received a us10 meal voucher which was nice the pty to mvd flight was on time the economy extra seats are worth the extra cost they have a comfortable recline and provide seatback screens with recent movies tv shows and the alwaysentertaining flight map feature for a 7 hour flight the meal service is rather minimal for dinner at departure a small hamandcheese sandwich yogurt granola bar and a soda drink for arrival 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of water so i suggest having a good meal at the airport before boarding and bringing some snacks with you as this is encouraged by copas website i intend to keep using copa as the star alliance partner for trips to south america
18767,southwest airlines,3,lack of concern from southwest,i am quite disappointed with southwest i and several members of my company have been flying southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing i have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards i was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on may 16th 2023 after filing a lost report soon after deplaning i received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical for this reason a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from southwest baggage supervisor at midway airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 4050 things including ipads phones and other items this statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time with the concern that she displayed i must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone regardless of cost should be undertaken i would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the alabama location where all the lost items from all the southwest flights go now many thousands of items per day instead of 4050 i will remember the lack of concern from southwest me and my company employees fly in the future
14131,lufthansa,5,lack of service from their staff,i was not able to do this online myself as their online booking system kept telling me to contact customer service for any add ons i missed a step when i was originally booking online and i ended up booking my seat from barcelona to munich and not from munich to vancouver i was willing to pay for my seat i didnt have roaming on my phone so i used my friends phone i googled how to reach lufthansa from spain i couldnt call their 1800 customer service number because it didnt work from spain i googled everything from what area codes to use from spain to call lufthansa using a canadian phone well let me tell you with all this technology these companies have they dont make it easy on the customer its not enough we have us do all the work ourselves when booking tickets and checking in but its hard reaching customer service when you need them their online system is not user friendly and when it tells you to contact lufthansa directly but they dont offer you a phone number let alone a number for calling from spain or other foreign countries even though they have offices in these countries after i managed to find their number on google and it said it was lufthansas number i ended up calling the barcelona airport finally i did reach lufthansas offices in madrid this woman picked it up and she was speaking in spanish i asked her if anybody there speaks english because i know no spanish as soon as i said that her attitude changed she kept telling me that she didnt speak english i asked if some else there did she said nobody i told her all i wanted to do was book my seat but she kept telling me to call this old number that didnt exist because i had tried it the irony was this woman kept speaking to me in full english sentences but then she would say i dont speak english she would say sir you have to call this number for help sir nobody speaks english here not even my colleagues sir we have no manager here to help you i told her that her english was fine that she was speaking to me in full english sentences i was pleading with her to help me i got my friend to call her talk to her in spanish and she told my friend that she couldnt book our seats to wait till we got to the airport she told my friend that all the seats were booked the next morning when we arrived at barcelona airport we checked in at the lufthansa counter we told this agent what the woman on the phone told us about there being no seats available and he couldnt understand why she would say that because he said there were many seats available lufthansa needs to take responsibility for the lack of service from their staff behind the scenes
18446,skybus,3,company were unmoved by the inconvenience,the flights to the scilly isles are notorious due to the weather skybus has reduced the number of destinations it flies beyond its own hub at lands end we chose to fly from exeter as the drive down to lands end in the summer is a nightmare and we were travelling from london we drove 4 hours to exeter airport for the outward leg the flight was great and delayed only an hour we arrived back at st marys for the return flight 5 days later and discovered one of their twin otters had gone tech it was hard to find out this information as no announcements were made but check in wasnt progressing and finally the news broke we eventually found out they were going to split our flight into 2 islander flights 8 seater flights in 2 sequential flights to lands end the remaining otter was used to fly the scheduled lands end flight after reaching lands end we were going to be driven to exeter a 212 hour drive apologies from skybus staff were few and far between one child burst into tears we were told it was the best solution to preserve their schedule it was obvious this solution was best for the company but not for the passengers the remaining otter with sufficient range should have gone to exeter and the islanders used to shuttle to lands end to minimise the overall delay to all passengers we arrived in exeter 4 12 hours late a very unsatisfactory end to the holiday with a further 4 hour drive in our own car exhausting it appears the company were unmoved by the inconvenience and not prepared to extend operating hours to find a satisfactory solution be warned
15752,peach aviation,1,the aircraft was clean and new,flew peach aviation from bangkok to okinawa check in on both outward and return legs was very efficient and the aircraft was clean and new seat pitch as expected for an lcc was rather tight service from both aircrew and cabin crew was excellent safety was emphasised throughout this flight has no inflight entertainment food sold for purchase on board was very tasty the return flight was on time the outbound flight had a two hour delay but this was not caused by peach as the aircraft was in bangkok ready for departure on time air traffic control in china closed their airspace due to overload on the last day of return from lunar new year the pilot came personally to the boarding area to explain the issue and inform that he had obtained a new route via philippines air space saving a greater delay a free meal on board was provided
14710,meridiana,9,meridiana customer review,i went from florence to gatwick just a few days ago boarding went well the staff even helped with checking a tripod as extra luggage without paying a fee for it onboard one of the male steward looked somewhat irritated but that is to be expected we arrived on time and i found no serious issues would recommended to others
9968,flysafair,4,suitcases were damaged,my complaint is not necessarily with the airline but more so with the ground staff at either or tambo or george airports or both in the past year i have noticed a lot of scratches and dents on our luggage this even on the cape town flights we have even gone as far as wrapping them at a hefty price to try and protect them wrapping price has jumped rapidly over a short time currently r9000 and expecting it to be r10000 soon on our trip yesterday fa 228 16h05 or tambo to georg i was horrified at the condition of my and my wifes suitcases we specifically purchased more expensive and robust luggage cases to prevent damage well to no avail as they were damaged one can clearly see that the suit cases were carelessly and violently thrown from a distance many people are complaining of the same thing then there was also the situation of the airbridge at gate c 13 at or tambo that is out of order many old people and ladies with babies had to walk down the stairs onto ground level and back up into the plane this is very unprofessional for a major airport
4267,american eagle,3,the seat in front of mine was obviously filthy,american promises that they keep their planes clean especially during covid the seat in front of mine was obviously filthy and had been for some time the headrest had a layer of built up dead skin there was popcorn on the floor and there was a dirty water mark above my head none of these obvious things had been cleaned in quite some time i actually touched the seat in front of me and felt the greasy build up on the headrest its unbelievable that american airlines would lie about their cleanliness i have pictures to prove all my claims
20485,thomson airways,4,simply not good enough,just got back from dominican republic flew there and back thomson airways boeing 787 the flight out was okay the flight back not so the food was poor and none of the tvs worked on our side of the plane so we spent eight hours staring at the back of seat the cabin staff assured us that we would recieve gbp29 each within the next two weeks for the inconvenience twenty pounds or not this is simply not good enough for such a modern plane
10003,french bee,9,in flight service was attentive,family of 5 2 small children parents and grand mum los angeles to paris return check in was easy boarding was easy great service even though we were late to the gate in flight service was attentive courteous and helpful reasonably priced and food was tasty the aisles are slightly narrower but good leg room plenty of overhead storage on both flights plane had new entertainment equipment and felt new great value for money pro tip make booking with hot meal its worth being included or bring ample snacks drinks and meal cup of noodles from airporthome
4811,austrian airlines,3,forced me to check in my luggage,terrible service th lady at the check out wasnt even looking at me when i check in she was busy talking to her colleague then she forced me to check in my luggage cabin which was 99 kilos authorized weight is 10 kg she said even business class people i dont allow this so you can imagine for economy class as yourself that was very downgrading

14901,myanmar airways,5,myanmar airways customer review,flight rgntvymgz on an old atr plane very worn from the inside and outside cabin crew very friendly and efficient small snacks and drinks offered on each sector recommended
1872,air india,5,air india are idling,air india still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating overall the aircraft vtang was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors only certain screens were operational on the ife and even these were prone to locking up the flight map was not available at all aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement checkin and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule food served was average to poor looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area we had a connecting flight from delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags walk through to a domestic checkin to deposit bags and then go airside again nothing to do with the airline but indian bureaucracy at its best overall the flight was ok but air india are idling until the tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard
8062,dragonair,3,unfortunately really disappointing,hong kong to da nang first day as cathay dragon but unfortunately really disappointing no inflight entertainment no drinks run of any kind chose the chicken with noodles but the chicken must have been on holiday staff were ok and cabin clean but it all looked rather tired have had much better experiences on nofrills airlines for less money

6401,caribbean airlines,7,they are reasonable,i went to jamaica for a week on vacation and i have no complaints regarding caribbean airlines not the best airline on the planet but theyre definitely by far not the worst they are reasonable and if youre willing to spend a bit more than business class definitely is substantially more comfortable the only drawback that i can think of but that isnt their fault is the fact that on the return trip i had to make four stops in four different countries
16936,royal air maroc,8,a lot of effort in recent years,casablanca to barcelona ram has made a lot of effort in recent years it is the fault of other operators at airports such as the delivery of luggage delays etc so let us be indulgent at times and lets not say that bad things you also have to share the positive which will push the teams in place to do much more work fr ram a fait beaucoup defforts ces dernires annes avec peu de moyens et une concurrence de plus en plus froce et ce quil faut savoir cest quon responsabilise souvent la compagnie alors que cest aussi la faute des autres oprateurs dans les aroports tels que la livraison de bagages les retards etc soyons donc indulgents par moments et ne disons pas que les mauvaises choses il faut savoir partager aussi le positif ce qui poussera les quipes en place faire beaucoup plus dfforts
9129,eurowings,8,in general a good airline,in general a good airline and i often use them what upset me is the fact that if i reserve a seat during booking and pay for it the fee for the seat reservation may be higher during checkin and i have to pay an uplift fee for it and an additional input to increase the corporate identity could be to provide the cabin crew unique masks today everybody wears their individual mask
14873,montenegro airlines,7,a decent airline,stansted to tivat overall this is a decent airline the cabin staff speak english the plane although old is fine for a short 2 hour flight and the journey was comfortable a few pointers only one of the toilets in the plane were working which was annoying there was a basic selection of drinks and a simple cheese sandwich we took off over 2 hours late but it was unclear if this was the fault of the airline or the ground staff on this flight we arrived too late to land in tivat it has no night facilities so we had to land in podgorica they did in the end put a bus for all of us to reach tivat although the delay was significant

7815,csa czech airlines,9,best thing was the legroom,prague to brussels the best thing was the legroom you had enough space im 187cm it was a good flight and the cabin crew was friendly and will try to help you if you have a question it was an a319 without entertainment maybe the company can give one free beverage because they are a traditional airline
20425,thomson airways,2,this crew made me feel less than safe,we booked a 7 day package with thomas cook flying from manchesterdubrovnik return our designated airline was thomson we had a pleasant and uneventful flight outbound on time and crew very good after a lovely week in croatia we had an early morning start to the airport for our return flight to manchester on 21st may the flight was on time and no dramas boarding then it took a downward turn we were seated in row 31 near the back of the aircraft from the moment that the doors closed we were subjected to an absolute cacophony of noise from two female crew in the galley behind us this went on over the security video most of which i couldnt hear and down the runway to take off we were hopeful that this would come to an end once in the air but no such luck due to turbulence and the pilot asking that passengers remained seated we were treated to a continued running commentary with added shrieks regarding the social media postings of these ladies their friends and their nights out i was trying to read my book feeling very tired and in need of relaxation 20 minutes after take off i gave up and pressed the crew call button no response after another 1015 minutes my call was clearly noticed amongst the girls catch up and one of the flight attendants came to my seat i politely explained that we were quite tired and that their constant noise was disrupting my flight i was then told 3 times that this particular attendant and her colleague were only human and like a chat silly me there i was thinking that they were in their workplace and responsible for passenger comfort and safety when i pressed on and asked if perhaps they could just keep it down i was told to please dont say keep it down there seemed to be absolutely no awareness that several rows of seats in front of the galley could hear every word and no recognition that their conversation topics might be inappropriate in a supposedly professional setting whatever training this crew received regarding their conduct whilst airborne clearly needs refreshing and soon the high frequency chat went on throughout the flight my particular favourite was the comment to a passenger in a seat a couple of rows in front of us which was were out of jack daniels although who would want to be drinking jd at this time of day lol i suspect that anyone particularly a nervous flier who might have fancied a tot of whisky had their card well and truly marked right there most worrying was the 1015 minute delay in pressing the call button and the arrival of crew two rows from the galley this was put down to the captains request for seatbelts to be fastened so what happens if someone has a heart attack during turbulence which was to be fair mild doesnt bear thinking about it was crystal clear that for the initial part of this flight over 40 minutes the ladies in charge of the rear of this aircraft were paying absolutely no attention to what might be happening in the cabin i looked back frequently and they were always facing the back of the aircraft frightening in this day and age i have complained about this to thomson as this crew made me feel less than safe needless to say no reply has been received to date hence this post my next flight in august is with thomas cook they used to be the poor relation to thomson i book them ahead of thomson now if there is a choice

8802,estonian air,4,estonian air customer review,excellent lowcost airline to a popular destination the staff at gatwick moved heaven and earth to get us out despite a long delay due to snow at tallinn and a storm over stockholm although we flew out in the middle of the night we got there in the end on the way back everything went smoothly would have given them 5 stars except the food and drink on board is pricey and this was not obvious at the time otherwise on the way out i would have taken some s out of the atm rather than spending them all at gatwick coming back i managed to buy a cake and some coffee having already eaten in tallinn before the flight for 45 krooni not bad as the cake was huge would fly with them again when visiting estonia rather than take a slightly more expensive connecting flight via amsterdam
18893,spicejet,3,below average flight,below average flight recently i travelled in spicejet on 06july2022 i have travelled twice with this spicejet but i made a mistake giving this airline a second chance every time spicejet flight is 4050 min late so as to avoid the 60 min mark so as to evade any penalty after deboarding the luggage took forever to come and due to it delayed flight delayed luggage i missed my connecting train for which i had paid a hefty amount in tatkaal tickets its mandatary to pay and choose a seat before webcheck in
14748,mihin lanka,6,not impressed at all,short flight from male to colombo of 70 minutes very poor legroom seat width was ok no ife so quite boring its a sister airline of srilankan but a very poor sister i must say only one packaged drink was served like a lcc the staff were mostly male and were not so interested to serve it was a full flight so restrooms were crowded since only the rear restrooms were permitted for the economy class not impressed at all the announcements were also not clear at all
10350,germania airline,9,good service throughout,flew out to corfu in september using germania never flown with them before nice airline very prompt both going out and returning good service throughout helpful cabin crew film for the flight and complimentary meal and drinks which was unexpected very good flight prices will definitely look to flying with them again only downside no online check in service which at present hope they will have that soon
15934,peruvian airlines,4,peruvian airlines customer review,we flew from lima to arequipa on one of peruvians aged 737300s the planes are in an alleconomy layout with very tight seats still in their southwest airlines decor the airline offers nofrills barebones service by a very attractive group of male and female flight attendants a free drink and snack box with an inedible sandwich is offered this is the most basic way to travel around peru i cant suggest flying this carrier it is cheap and gets you where you need to go dont expect them to run on time either
1427,air china,9,very inexpensive,first time to fly with air china our round trip from munich to pyongyang and saigon was perfect all flights on time very good service spacious seats foremost in premium economy i can recommend air china the round trip was only 1100 very inexpensive
19668,tam airlines,7,cabin clean crew attentive,sao paulo to buenos aires with tam airlines on time depature and arrival cabin clean crew attentive simple breakfast served in a bag plenty of juices coffee etc cockpit announcements on take off and landing had to deplane by bus but probably the fault of the chaotic airport too much carry on bagagge allowed and not enough space why cant the airline staff at the boarding gate do something about it
17431,sa express,1,sa express customer review,flew sa express cptdur and previously durcptdur crew have always been excellent they are warm and friendly right from boarding where we are always greeted by a great smile food is good sandwiches for dinner with chocolate for dessert a good selection of drinks were offered leather seats are very comfortable but are now showing some signs of age love flying sa express because their planes always seem private and warm baggage was on the carousel quickly from deplaning overall three great experiences with sax
7677,croatia airlines,7,basic standard service with no frills,croatia airlines is a small regional european airline based in zagreb i flew from zagreb to zurich to connect with my swiss airlines flight back to singapore the aircraft was a turboprop dash8 for the 1 hour flight to zurich flight attendants came around to serve crackers and beverages overall the flight was more or less similar to other european airlines flying intraeuropean routes basic standard service with no frills
16630,qatar airways,3,food and beverage good,first leg was great great crew food and beverage good travelling with 4 kids all happy second leg dohcpt dreadful no kids meals ife rubbish plane old and dirty even though it was only 45 years old extremely turbulent flight but no reassurance from crew or pilot for nervous passengers

1131,air busan,8,air busan customer review,air busan was what i would expect from a lcc seat pitch a little tight but enough for me flight attendants a little abrasive but you cant judge an airline by one flight attendant overall good airline and it serves its purpose well affordable no frills flying so that is what you should expect south korea is small so flights with air busan are only in the 1 hour range
7037,china southern airlines,8,cabin service should be enhanced,i was almost late for checking in like 7 mins left the staff of china southern were very friendly and enthusiastic and assisted me to handle the luggage checkin matters and helped me to get through all the procedure that needed for covid19 application however the cabin service should be enhanced especially there are no socket and usbplot on the aircraft a380 and no pillows and earphones are provided which are necessities for international flight meanwhile the crew members should smile more when they work hopefully they can attach more importance on these aspects
5812,blue1,3,blue1 customer review,early morning blue1 flight heloul with md90 aircraft they charge for everything on board breakfast 5 euros which would have been too much for me but sandwich with coffee would have cost the same so bought the unhealthy bun coffee for 250 on finnair you get a sandwich and coffee for free even on this 1 hour route crew nice with one exception but they did not check that luggage was stowed away before landing does not give a nice impression especially after the problems that sas and blue1 have had with their planes lately
1741,air france,9,would fly air france again,very smooth flight seat space is very comfortable for economy 81 cm much more than others offer good entertaining and nice crew free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack only the snack was bad and only dry bread delay one hour but arrived on time would fly air france again
14775,monarch airlines,7,they get the basics right,gatwick to lanzarote short queue at gatwick checkin staff were polite boarding process fine plenty of overhead locker space as flight not full departed about 2030 mins late as 1 passenger failed to board and bags had to be found and removed from aircraft announcements from front of cabin and cockpit were clear announcements from rear of cabin totally unintelligible announcements in english only smooth flight cabin crew professional no attempt at interaction with customers unless you wanted to buy something typical uncomfortable hard nonadjustable seats leg room was ok for a 1m 75cm adult clean aircraft clean well stocked toilet when i used it no bells and whistles but they get the basics right for the price paid would use again

15374,olympic air,4,olympic air customer review,athsof on q400 noisy plane during the 1 hour 5 min flight they offered sandwich refreshments or wine and coffee tea with a croissant food was very bad and tasteless staff was professionals and friendly flight was on time appearance of plane was clean
9919,flysafair,9,crew were friendly and efficient,excellent flights between johannesburg and mauritius we paid for extra legroom which was worth the money as normal seats are quite cramped both flights left on time and arrived slightly ahead of schedule crew were friendly and efficient and we were even provided with a box of food which was unexpected
14123,lufthansa,5,frequent flyer programme atrocious,i flew lufthansa three times last year twice to india and once to japan the india flights were rather surprisingly alright and the japan one less so but my problem is not with the flights themselves but rather with lufthansas frequent flyer programme miles more which is simply atrocious first of all there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being for some reason the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary whereas my daughter and i flew together she got no mileage for two of her four flights and i got nothing for one a different sector how do you fix this well you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request you get a cryptic by that i mean idiotic reply but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification all you can do is to redo the same thing you just did secondly i just tried looking to see how much credit i could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids how do you do this well you login to the miles more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested but perhaps changing the dates might help alongside a helpful link back to the previous page instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after so you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data of course not they clearly do not want you to use your mileage its truly pathetic and unworthy of a major airline
3238,airasia india,7,staff was good,the seats were comfortable leather covers on the seats provided premium look and comfort leg room was low as per my height 5 10 staff was good and services were also good ground staff was helpful due to some reason i wasnt able to check in and book my seat i requested on the counter he allotted me the seat although he requested for a positive feedback to be written
219,aer lingus,2,over 12 hours of delay,our flight from chicago to dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to zrich did not wait in dublin no big deal we thought usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss not the case with aer lingus aer lingus doesnt have relationship with most major airlines so you are presented with very limited choices our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time we even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didnt have flights to zrich on sunday so the next flight was two days away we took the alternate route they provided we were not provided any compensation or voucher we had to take the checked bags out at ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again they provided boarding passes only until amsterdam and not to the final destination zrich the baggage tag was also to amsterdam i raised concern over that the agent said we should collect our bags again at amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at amsterdam at klm counter the flight to amsterdam was delayed by two hours when we reached amsterdam we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again we did that and when we went to check in the bags we were told that their system doesnt show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again we paid for 30 kg check in bags due to aer linguss fault we now have to pay again for the baggage 55 euro and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro not only that we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved we spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus when we contacted aer lingus via them whatsapp business account they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link after filling out all the details meticulously the form crashes with a server error wow please dont ruin your trip vacation flying aer lingus
18725,south african airways,9,thanks to the outstanding crew,early morning flight from dakar to johannesburg the aircraft came from washington and a new crew took over the seats are beginning to show their age but are still very comfortable they provide you with a mattress a duvet and an oversized pillow the configuration was 222 but i heard that in the new aircrafts it is 121 the crew did a fantastic job especially during the emergency landing in accra to evacuate a passenger who had a stroke they were very professional and friendly however as usual the meals are nothing special and saa should really look at the quality of their catering overall a great flight thanks to the outstanding crew
6597,cathay pacific airways,7,attentive but not friendly,cabin crew attentive but not friendly excellent entertainment in term of quality and choice the cabin and toilets were kept clean food and beverage were very good in term of quantity and service my complaint is the leg room which was tight especially on the return flight between hong kong and dubai
9222,eva air,7,seats not very comfortable,seoul to los angeles via taipei the food is decent but not perfect boeing 777 was very old on both los angeles flights the seats are not very comfortable all my flights were delayed for from 30 minutes up to more than 1 hour hello kitty boeing 777 on tpelax was horrible old and the interior colors are annoying plastic forks and knives are not for 5 star airlines service on board was good no slippers or toothbrush were provided on longhaul flights
10931,hawaiian airlines,4,poor quality offerings,phoenix to honolulu in order to enjoy a trip from paradise home one must pass through the gates of purgatory which is another word for hawaiian airlines within the daniel inouye airport in honolulu for two seniors traveling with luggage this was an excruciating experience the three separate and long lines needing to endure just in order to check baggage was senseless the walk from the main terminal to the gate to the departure area might as well have been from downtown waikiki which might have been more pleasant and then theres the food onboard or more precisely the absence of anything worthwhile to consume fortunately we learned our lesson on the outbound flight after going hungry for about eight hours we packed a good lunch and snacks and were then able to bypass the airlines poor quality offerings
9670,fly540com,4,delay without any announcement,nairobi to mombasa flight delayed without proper notification was at the airport as early as 530 to wait till 9pm with a child no compensation of even a soft drink kept saying flight departs at 8pm yet it took another 50 mins additional delay without any announcement

9942,flysafair,1,i would not recommend using their services,due to the flight being cancelled as a result of covid my party of 3 were unable to fly in march 2020 i have been trying to get a refund but have only been offered vouchers these are of no use to us as we live in the uk and are not going to south africa again i have had to accept only 55 of the value of the tickets in a cash refund as the airline has taken 45 the airline said they did not cancel the flight the government did i was able to get a full refund from emirates who were to fly us to south africa and back keeping 45 of the money is dishonest in my view were i ever to visit sa again i would not fly with them in these uncertain times of covid i would not recommend using their services
3443,airasia x,6,leg room was so small,denpasar to auckland via kuala lumpur the seat was not confortable and the leg room was so small definitely it is not recommended to travel with airasia x for a journey more than 2 hours entertainment system was not available on board the flight attendants are getting better

15966,philippine airlines,8,cabin service was excellent,checkin at ninoy aquino international airport was remarkably easy and organized for naia our flight was delayed by an hour due to the aircraft being towed to the gate approximately 15min before scheduled departure time boarding was organized i liked that they boarded senior citizens like myself and my wife earlier the cabin service was excellent the flight was very smooth and comfortable some minor knitpicking the interactive map was not functioning for the entire flight which disappointed me and my wifes entertainment screen did not function at all no other problems were noted we did receive all of our luggage at honolulu international when we arrived pal must work on its ontime performance and fix some of the glitches on their aircraft in order to remain competitive unfortunately for pal naia is probably pals biggest achilles heel being too outdated and overcrowded also terminals are very far apart with not transit linking any of the terminals a new airport is being constructed in nearby bulacan province which will improve access to the philippines and pal can add newer aircraft to its fleet
3143,airasia,5,no apology or explanation,the one hour delay of the flight was only communicated when i arrived at the airport so i got stuck there no apology or explanation in regards to the delay given neither by gate staff nor by the pilot its the 2nd time this happened to me within a month so it seems this has become the norm now otherwise uneventful flight

7900,cubana airlines,5,cubana airlines customer review,lgwhol and havlgw at the airport we stocked up on magazines drinks and newspapers the inflight entertainment is shocking make sure you buy drinks etc at the airport because half way through the flight to holguin they ran out of everything but beer and rum dinner was either a choice of chicken or beef on both flights and wasnt that bad the seats were extremely uncomfortable and staff can barely speak english outbound to holguin the plane was half full so we managed to move towards the back of the plane into a seat of two in the middle which meant more legroom couldnt hear the announcements whatsoever on both flights and couldnt hear the safety video to be honest cubana wasnt as bad as we were expecting just make sure youre prepared with entertainment and drinks etc
11315,icelandair,3,nontransferable and nonrefundable,i booked my reservation on april 17 2023 for travel 7 months down the road in november this will be my 1st and probably last booking on icelandair i booked the flight myself on the icelandair website my goal was to pay for 1 additional bag on the outbound flight from boston to iceland but i made a mistake immediately after confirming the booking on the website i received an email detailing the booking at that time i noticed the additional bag fee of 55 was for the return flight from iceland to boston i immediately called icelandair customer service and explained to them that i made a my mistake they said there is no way to book an extra bag on the outbound flight until checking in at the counter on the day of travel since i am departing on a partner airline of icelandair and no refund will be granted i explained that i had made a mistake and am calling customer service hours after confirmation of the booking the rep told me that i could write to their customer support about my issue which i did their response thank you for contacting us and choosing to fly icelandair unfortunately we are unable to fulfill your request as extra baggage purchases are nontransferable and nonrefundable the terms and conditions of baggage purchases can be reviewed below its not the 55 but the principle of the matter i made a mistake and immediately contacted icelandair about it and nonrefundable is unacceptable i even asked for a credit to be used on future travel or food stuff but there was no acceptance by icelandair
22998,xiamen airlines,7,xiamen airlines customer review,from shanghai to xiamen the flight was delayed one hour due to air traffic control served pork with rice 2 hours flying time not bad
4520,arik air,7,arik air customer review,we have flown martinair 3 times to orlando we have chosen martinair because they are cheap and are the only one flying nonstop to orlando however its a pity that you have to pay for personal entertainment in economy whereas in the comfort class its free further more the cabin crew on these flights were very helpful
15843,pegasus airlines,8,accept the fact that you get what you pay for,takeoff and landing was right ontime which usually is an issue for european low budget airlines service is good prices are cheap for inflight catering seats might surely be more comfortable but you shall accept the fact that you get what you pay for pegasus eventually became my goto airline for short haul domestic turkish flights with its high pricequality ratio
3635,aircalin,4,beware buying a fully refundable ticket,nadi to noumea aircalin is the only airline i have ever flown that does not allow for baby strollers car seats or cots to be checked in without paying for additional luggage also beware when buying a fully refundable ticket it is nearly impossible to cancel a flight on aircalin you cant do it on line and you cant do it over the phone you can only do it in writing and then if you are lucky you may receive the refund 30 days later
15651,openskies,4,openskies customer review,what a disappointment when we first flew openskies in 2010 from newark to paris it was wonderful the lounge was beautiful and exclusive the seating on the flight was spacious and comfortable they offered us champagne etc all this in the cheapest seats on the plane this time the cheapest seats on the plane felt like the cheapest seats on any plane this flight was from jfk to orly first we were unceremoniously dismissed at the entry to the lounge the employee told us we were allowed to wait at the gate with everybody else in a very snarky tone fine then the seats on the plane were the same as seats on any flight 3 across uncomfortable recline position one of our seats kept flopping backwards food was standard airline fare the plane didnt even have the overhead air circulation controls it was stifling for the entire flight no individual seatback entertainment available but they hand you an ipad what nonsense i have never seen a skimpier selection of inflight entertainment literally just a few tv shows a few movies very little audio a couple of games with the return flight we didnt even bother accepting the ipad neither did many other passengers i noticed i know this may come across as whiny but when you look at the website and what the airline promises believe me they fall far short of their promises the good news the flight was empty both ways no surprise there and we arrived on time flight staff was no better or worse than any flight staff totally a disappointing experience given what they promise adjust your expectations downward
2638,air north yukons airline,6,air north yukons airline customer review,air north describes its class of service as yukoner economy which i thought probably referred to a concept of warmhearted hospitality and generosity this held true for my first flight in their 737400 but after flying in the hs748 im wondering if the term is actually more about resilience in the face of harsh conditions cramped conditions in the hs748 aside the service overall was pretty good staff were almost all friendly and efficient flights ran on schedule and reasonable food was provided no inflight entertainment system but at the time i flew the stunning everchanging landscape below was all the entertainment i could want
23092,yemenia,5,yemenia customer review,sanah to mumbai on a330 a full flight but the crew were efficient polite and with passable english i had window seat 30a and the legroom was just fine food was good but a little dry inflight entertainment not very exciting some arabic drama without subtitles announcements from cockpit were clear and kept passengers updated the negative is the awkward timings of the flight which arrives in mumbai at 4 in the morning
19698,tam airlines,3,tam airlines customer review,flight puerto seguro sao paulo the flight was planned for 2 hours in time for the connection from gru to lhr however half way through the plane circled for a long time while a heavy thunderstorm raced around after one hour we landed in rio de janeiro which was only announced in portuguese nothing in english which was surprising as english is regarded the main language in the airline world eventually we were on the ground for 3 hours lost our connection flight and during 3 hours only offered a glass of water from a crew which found more fun in entertaining themselves and a few passengers than explaining what was going on for safety reasons it is ok to delay but information should be announced in main languages when in gru we were offered hotel and food and oneway taxi and was booked on next day flight to europe rather slow but with good service from the staff in gru
15458,oman air,9,cabin crew were friendly and professional,the in flight services i experienced on this flight was excellent the cabin crew were friendly and professional i was connecting after a long and a tiring journey flying in from canada with two prior long lay overs the friendly manner of the cabin crew made me forget my fatigue the airline did not serve my choice of food and drink but the crew members were extremely diplomatic in negotiating the substitutes they offered please keep up your good work
8843,ethiopian airlines,2,service has been utterly shocking,from the minute i crossed the boarding gate to now i have had a terrible experience with ethiopian airlines firstly my flight in oman was delayed by 40 minutes this meant when i arrived in ethiopia i had to run to catch my connecting flight the addis ababa airport is an absolute nightmare a bottle neck of thousands and thousands of people squeezing and pushing trying to all get through security i nearly missed my flight to johannesburg when i get onto the plane i realise i did not have the same seat i booked when i went through the gate where they scan your ticket i was given a different ticket by the person at the counter but i didnt think anything of it this person did not even bother to tell me he was moving me from a front row aisle seat to a third row middle seat when i asked the air hostess why my seat had been moved she said they had a vip they had to give my seat to i felt absolutely disrespected like i did not matter how could they just move me to a middle back seat without even speaking to me about it the food on the flight was terrible i could not even eat it i had two bites because i was so hungry but left the rest the food was so dry and tasteless and really just not good at all both of the planes also had really weird smells on them when i landed in south africa after being awake for 37 hours i stood at the carousal for over an hour waiting for my bag but it did not come out thanks to my airtag i could see that my bag was still in ethiopia i was so exhausted dirty and so angry that i just burst into tears the man at the ea counter did not know what to do with me he assured me that i could go buy clothes and toiletries for 80 and i could just claim it back from ethiopia airlines although this was a huge inconvenience because i was leaving for cape town 2 days later i felt better knowing they would fit the bill for the extra things i had to go buy my bag only arrived 29 hours later and the lock on my bag was also broken i submitted my claim two and a half months ago and have still not received my reimbursement or any feedback from them i have sent so many emails following up on my reimbursement and i have had no response i have also filled out an online form on their website and have sent a message to their facebook page i have sent hundreds of emails but they just ignore me their service has been utterly shocking every step of the way this is definitely not africas best airline i will never fly with them again

1217,air canada,5,most unpleasant transatlantic flight,i fly internationally five or six times a year and recently completed a flight from frankfurt to vancouver on air canada 839 this was a fully booked flight and because we did not check in soon enough my wife and were stuck sitting in seats 30 b and c this row of seats had no window and where there should have been two seats the airline shoved in three and the door to a toilet was directly beside us in an already narrowed corridor to somehow squeeze in beside our fellow passenger seated in 30 a seat with no window we were crammed into the equivalent of a 34 seat with limited ability to even rest our arms during the flight it all added up to the most unpleasant transatlantic flight i have ever been on the bottom line air canada on row 30 on this plane you need to remove a seat this plane is designed for two seats instead of three in this row especially with the washroom right there
7734,croatia airlines,4,croatia airlines customer review,fra to dbv a320 looked like it had seen better days inflight service was full service though i wished they had saved on food wastage a very cardboard chicken salad and a dry swiss roll it was like flying was in the 70s a british airways tea and biscuit would have been much more welcome captain informative but cabin crew slightly aloof
7024,china southern airlines,9,staff were friendly professional,i was pleasantly surprised by the service i received during my recent flight the staff were friendly professional and went out of their way to ensure my comfort the inflight meals were delicious and served promptly when we encountered some turbulence the pilots kept us informed and made every effort to minimize any discomfort i would not hesitate to recommend them
6987,china eastern airlines,2,terrible service,shanghai to chicago i was in need of a wheel chair and when i arrive in shanghai there was no wheel chair they told us we would get off on the tarmac and a bus would come pick us up the food was cold i gave it back to the flight stewardess they were very rude wouldnt smile terrible service definitely not accommodating they seem like they really dont care about you as a passenger
8548,egyptair,8,improved by leaps and bounds,athens to johannesburg via cairo when flying with egyptair one has to be aware that no alcohol is served on board this can be a damper for some it wasnt a major inconvenience for me its fleet is dated and their entertainment system is not up to date with the latest movies however they have improved by leaps and bounds the manager at the athens airport was very helpful and accommodating on board flight attendants were polite friendly and helpful on all my sectors in flight meals have improved tremendously and my starter entre from cairo onwards definitely could compete with the likes of emirates a very pleasant relaxing trip price wise cheaper than their competitors yes i will most definitely fly them again
12126,jet2com,6,warn regarding resort transfers,while i cant fault the plane cabin crew or flight i can however seriously warn travellers regarding the resort transfers myself and my partner were left stranded at the resort hotel by a driver that did not stop at our hotel despite us being at the designated place at the designated time i stood on the hotel steps and watched him sail straight past without even slowing down one expensive phone call to the 24 hour uk helpline resulted in a 140 taxi fare to the airport upon emailing jet2 on return i have been told that they asked the transfer company and the driver has said he did stop looked but was unable to find us so drove off and as reimbursement they have said they wont refund the taxi fare but we can have 2 free inflight meals next trip as if there will be a next trip with this airline i would think long and hard before you trust this company even to the point of arranging your own transfers as that way you will be guaranteed to get to the airport at no extra expense
4158,american airlines,2,7 hour flight and no meals or snacks,7 hour flight and no meals or snacks other than biscoff cookies website indicates snack boxes for purchase not the case for most on the flight i didnt think i needed to pack my own food for the kids because i usually fly delta also i almost missed my flight because they moved it up 2 hours and sent no notifications of the change luckily i double checked my flight the night before
20394,thomas cook airlines,1,the staff were incredible,orlando to gatwick i was told 5 minutes before boarding my flight that my precious 4 year old grandson had died unexpectedly i was devastated with inconsolable grief the staff of thomas cook airlines and particularly the cabin manager were incredible they upgraded me to a private corner so i could grieve privately and looked after me like angels the whole flight and right off the plane to the arms of my waiting relative thank you thomas cook you are stars

14744,meridiana,3,meridiana customer review,i really hate this airline sometimes no major beef with the aircraft i have only ever flown long haul on decent a330 aircraft but the organization of the airline is terrible it is basically impossible to speak to anyone who knows what they are doing or that has access to necessary information three times now i have attempted to book either during reservation or after bassinet row seats or biz upgrade only to be told that it is all full up and not possible you get to the flight and find empty seats furthermore they want to sell the bulkhead seats for 45 euros but will not prioritise for people with young children so first come first served basically on the upside in biz i ate the best food i have had on a plane for a long time good antipasti great pasta and decent second course meat as well
20713,tigerair australia,1,denied to board our flight,melbourne to cairns today myself and my partner were basically denied to board our flight we had arrived well in advance and we were very diligent in checking which gate needed to board the actual gate did not appear until extremely late which admittedly put us off guard when we finally realised the gate had rappeared we immediately ran towards we received a call letting us know that the gate was about to close literally one minute before arriving to the gate the very apathetic staff told us that our bag had been removed which we had paid for therefore we were off the flight we will never travel again with you

21586,uzbekistan airways,4,uzbekistan airways customer review,lhrtaslhr september 2014 step back in time with uzbekistan airways plus points ontime in both directions reasonable ground experience felt safe some staff efficient and multilingual and completes londontashkent in half the time of the alternatives eg aeroflot negative points old 757 in both directions with fairly uncomfortable seats and limited legroom highly limited entertainment on small dropdown screens egdated film dubbed into russian and juddering audio channels food in generous quantities but mediocre tepid and tasteless tea some cabin crew rude and sighed heavily at minor requests from passengers or barked one word instructions randomunfair means of allocating front row seats once on board one highlight is the bizarre video played three times to cover uzbek russian and english illustrating that passengers are prohibited from drinking duty free spirits fighting smoking playing with safety equipment or stealing airline property in summary the airline does ok given their ageing fleet and the countrys limited exposure to noncis countries i would not actively choose this airline especially for any connecting route on to indiakorea but it was an acceptable means of getting to and from tashkent
7691,croatia airlines,5,croatia airlines customer review,i had the flight pariszagrebparis in december i have mixed emotions about croatia airlines positive sides both flights arrived on time nice clean aircrafts and very friendly cabin crew negative the boarding was disorganized food service is unacceptable consisting of olives cheesecrackers for one way and disgusting sandwich for back flight and the checkin staff in paris was not friendly at all in terms of the food i think that the air company should go to the low cost model allowing passengers to buy the normal high quality food and drinks on board i do not understand serving food which is inedible this ruins the image of the company
18311,singapore airlines,7,i was not offered a drink,no staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass i was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service after one hour of waiting in a queue several people including me were finally get their passes while we were lining up many travellers probably first and business class cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first from what i feel they need a bigger crew to service the a380 staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service food was not ready for the first meal i had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else i was not offered a drink and when i asked they signalled me to wait i waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately second meal was a total disaster it took an hour for our cabin to be served to the point that many people who were already served they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew drinks were offered and served very minimally i can confidently say it because my second flight later with an a350 it was a joy again everything ran on time polite and civilized boarding no late service i still can feel a drop in service as compared to prepandemic time

14426,malaysia airlines,7,happily use malaysia airlines again,check in at bali airport was quick and efficient malaysia airlines business passengers may use the premier lounge at bali airport this lounge is shared by many airlines it is ok but nothing special flight boarded on time but departure was slightly delayed due to some cleanup work that had to take place on the runway suspending all flights for a short while the b737 was the older style aircraft that has not yet been refurbished the seats however were comfortable for a 3 hour flight cabin crew were attentive and meal was served soon after take off i chose the red snapper with rice and ginger soya sauce very tasty malaysia do not seem to promote alcoholic drinks on their short haul flights however seeing another passenger with a glass of red wine we also asked for the same however it never arrived weather was a bit stormy coming into klia and the flight landed about 30 minutes late an ok flight and will happily use malaysia airlines again

12315,jetstar airways,5,staff kept on cutting corners,our flight was cancelled which we did not know about until we got to the airport early hours of the morning we had been contacted via email the previous night while we were sleeping although it was heart breaking to miss a whole day of being in australia since we were only going for the weekend for a wedding we were grateful that we were able to be scheduled on a night flight via jetstar the same day however this review is to provide feedback on the staff that was on duty to provide other options for us customers whose flight were delayed that morning it was a long que and everyone were waiting patiently despite the lack of sleep and change of plans it was disappointing to view that the staff kept on cutting corners in serving his own people in which we witnessed a total of three not travelling together before we got served none of these customers stood in the que and walked straight to the desk and chatted with the staff in their own language fed up another had walked to the counter just when we got there and one of us told him to go to the back of the line in which the staff stated that we needed to calm down and threatened us with calling security we left it as it is because we were desperate to get on a flight that day as we did not want to miss the wedding altogether hopefully staff gets taught about fairness and it is not about cutting corners with your own people
6532,cathay dragon,6,planes are really old,kuala lumpur to hong kong these planes are really old not the first time taking cathay dragon flight from kl to cathay but discovered that most of the a330 are more than 20 years old most probably these planes are passing on from cathay pacific food was just so so no wine or blanket was offered the cabin service is fine no complain i just wish cathay dragon should consider getting new planes to operate

155,aegean airlines,2,hand luggage to be checked in,just flew in from istanbul to athens on the way to london the first leg was fine however this review is about flight a3608 on july 8th 2022 from athens to london it seems to have become a habit by airlines to force hand luggage to be checked in which is an annoyance for anyone who is familiar with the wait this results in at heathrow the crew are nice and friendly and apart from a minor delay the flight was on time i specifically asked for a window seat and was placed in position 28a its only when i got on that i realized this seat is on the emergency door and this aircraft type does not support a window on this position

14802,monarch airlines,3,awkward and unfriendly,very awkward and unfriendly checkin staff at gatwick for flight to london gatwick i had no large bag to check in only one piece of cabin baggage which they weighed and then rudely told me it was overweight which was strange because it hadnt been considered overweight on the previous flight with monarch from tenerife meanwhile they were happily checking in people who had several pieces of hand baggage well over the allowance people who were obese and weighed at least 3 times my slender 9 stone

6919,china eastern airlines,6,on board service was very simple,kunming to shenzhen in july 2019 the weather that day at shenzhen was terrible for flights to land so we were running into a delay and the departure time was not ensured even till 2200 the china eastern lounge in kunming was not bad with food options including yunnan noodle but the environment was not excellent the light was very dim and the decoration was very old i really that they prepared sandwich and bread for us because the typhoon was affecting southern china so many passengers were waiting at the lounge we got on board at 2210 and the plane pushed back at 2300 not a bad delay at all this flight uses a newer boeing 737800 featuring a ptv for business class and the legroom was 97cm comparing to 91cm in the old planes the on board service was very simple because its a night time flight and the snack on board only included biscuits fruit and drinks finally we landed at shenzhen at 0030 just 10 mins later than the schedule not bad overall i paid 184 for this flight i should say nothing did bad but also not eventful
10362,germanwings,6,very cramped,flew germanwings from london stansted to cologne bonn flight delayed by over an hour at london stansted inconvenience made worse by fact that this was not announced or posted on display boards i know this is airport responsibility so i left vip lounge as the departure is in different area of airport to lounge accessible only by a monorail and no return allowed this meant a long wait in a crowded gate area flight was full to capacity and very cramped normal offer of high priced beverages etc offered during flight low cost option with more service and professionalism than other lccs i would use again

977,air bagan,9,air bagan customer review,ground service is terrible compared to in the air manual checkin process with no computers this airline seems to be the only one to have a lounge in the domestic terminal in yangon airconditioned and friendly associates offering a cheese croissant no bathroom inside so that was a drag people in lotus class got a private van to the plane which was nice compared to cramming onto a bus onboard the flight was pretty good the front of the plane is much quieter compared to the back their inflight magazine was pretty decent and the english grammatically correct even on short flights they gave you food on my ygnmdy flight which was about 50 minutes they served a full breakfast seats were pretty comfortable on par with united a320 first class seats i dont really see the need for inflight entertainment on such short flights

21984,vistara,4,return flight was considerably better,mumbai to singapore a mediocre experience vistara doesnt have early bag drop in mumbai when i landed in singapore i found that two wheels of my suitcase were damaged vistaras rep said that wear and tear would not be compensated which i accepted the repair man i took it to noticed a large gash on body and said i should replace the bag on both sectors my food quality and quantity were lacking outbound sector was an overnight flight at 0145hrs breakfast comprised of an omelette chicken sausage and something else return lunch was a bowl of curry with chicken vegetable and rice a salad started the meal and a small rasmalai for dessert lie flat seats in a 2x2 layout in the narrow body aircraft with little privacy theres not much time to sleep so its not a major issue i wasnt impressed by the crew on the outgoing flight perhaps because of the time of day i felt that they were trying to rush things but the return flight was considerably better internet on board voucher given did not work
4323,american eagle,4,experience was mediocre,this is a short 30 min flight from ord to ind last leg of our long trip the interior of the plane was horrible there was no service they said at the beginning if we want something call the attendants but they will not go through the aircraft all in all we got to the destination but the overall experience was mediocre at best with indifferent staff
283,aer lingus,6,no flight attendant is going to dictate to me,i had paid 50 in advance on top of my airfare to reserve a window seat in row 14 i was reassigned to a center aisle seat near the rear of the aircraft with no explanation given i have contacted the airline but they have refused to refund my money and now i have to go through the authorities ife systems did not work properly on the dubord leg of my flight no free alcohol was served on either leg im not sure if this is a new policy specific to this airline or if it is industrywide the cabin looked reasonably clean and the food was fairly good but they ran out of my preferred meal choice chicken by the time they got to my seat near the rear of the aircraft the beverage portion sizes were very small 6 oz 160 ml cans of soda flight time wheels up to wheels down was 7 hours and 51 minutes once we reached cruise altitude flight attendants marched up and down the aisles demanding passengers close their window shades and then the lights were dimmed to a lavender color i walked up to the galley and confronted the purser to demand an explanation and his response was that they did this to allow passengers to sleep most people do not ant to sleep on a flight in the early afternoon whats the point in paying 50 for a window that you dont get to look out of by the time i landed back home in chicago at 200 in the afternoon i felt terribly drowsy when i shouldve been wide awake and readjusting to central daylight time i can tell you this much next time i fly if im seated at a window no flight attendant is going to dictate to me whether the shade is up or down
12612,jetstar pacific,1,jetstar pacific customer review,when booking a one way flight from ho chi minh to hanoi i went with jetstar pacific because ive flown with jetstar asia multiple times and had a satisfactory experience and it was slightly cheaper than vietjet lets get this straight jetstar pacific is not jetstar airlines its a partner airline that was given the jetstar name so that they could have domestic flights in vietnam in this case jetstar should seriously consider severing ties as this is a determent to their brand if you check online they have flights from hcm and han up to 7 times a day i thought wow they must be doing brisk business i was wrong one week before i received an email saying that my flight was cancelled and they put us a flight 2 hours before i wanted to depart i was fine with that even thought wed have to get up earlier for our 2 hour trek to the airport from the village but on the way to the airport i get another email saying that our flight was delayed 6 hours when we arrived they told us it was a technical issue we were told that there were no earlier flights while waiting at the boarding area they only have 1 dedicated gate we found that they were boarding a flight for han my mom asked why we werent put on that flight and they said those customers had been waiting since 6am that morning 5 hours for their flight we werent offered any food or drink my mom had to ask for food vouchers which provided us with a sandwich as the time got closer to our supposed time of departure there were no agents at the gate no announcement made of further delays and no further emails when flight attendants for jetstar showed up for different flight they were immediately accosted by several riled passengers they were perfectly nice and one attendant looked up on his phone and found that we were delayed another 1 hour this is not published on their website so it was an internal source so by the time we boarded the plane it was past 7pm lets check the math by 7pm they managed to get off the ground 2 of the 7 flights they published passengers that day had more than a 70 chance of their flight being delayedcancelled i have a real suspicion that this was really them trying to get more people on a plane to save costs if this is their business model its not a good one since theyve lost any future business from me and anyone who flew that day

1772,air greenland,4,air greenland customer review,i flew to kangerlussuaq a330 a couple days later to nuuk dash7 then ilulissat kangerlussuaqcopenhagen dash7 a330 the flights were pleasant on time and meals onboard were delicious greenlandic products fish shrimp considering air greenland has more or less a monopoly on travel toin greenland the service was excellent on the kangerlussuaqnuuk leg we turned back 3 minutes before landing in nuuk due to sudden fog upon landing in kangerlussuaq we were given lunch vouchers worth 100 dkk and clear information on when we could attempt to fly again visitors must keep in mind that weather is very erratic and unpredicatable in greenland so you need to factor possible delays not under the control of the airline the safety card in the seat pocket had interesting information on how to use the seat upholstery to keep your feet warm in case of an emergency landing in arctic weather most unusual
17094,royal jordanian airlines,6,what used to be excellent soft product has really worsened,i have flown royal jordanian and its earlier version alia for close to 40 years it has always been reliable safe and good value for money recently the business class has taken a bit of downgrade first the good points good connection in amman good airport good aircraft gracious cabin crew and great value for money the minus points no more champagne service and very odd meals mostly inedible of four legs i took some had headphones some not some amenity kits some not what used to be excellent soft product has really worsened and the small tapas like food is awful
19644,tag airlines,8,overall a nice little airline,day trip from guatemala city to see the mayan temples at tikal closest airport is flores which actually is not where the airport is located it is in santa elena a couple miles from flores and then an hour drive to tikal check in at the small domestic terminal at gua at 515am for a 630am departure tag flies from gua to a few cities in guatemala then to honduras nicaragua costa rica and belize and all flights are on smaller prop planes from this little terminal check in quick and agents very friendly you get a plastic boarding pass that is colored based on your destination like the old southwest airlines used to do in the 70s and 80s and then they call blue or orange and you board when your color is called flight was on a saab 340a in decent condition and totally full nice flight attendant and friendly greetings from the cockpit delayed take off with inbound traffic and a bumpy cloudly 1015 minutes after takeoff but then smoothed out a drink and snack were served on the 45minute flight quick landing over beautiful flores which itself is just a tiny island in lake peten itza and taxi to the terminal only carryon so thru to the exit and off to tikal the return was the same 630pm departure except to pay the departure fee of qz20 about 3 us dollars and then go through international screening security to the gate it was a domestic flight so was kinda funny to be told go thru international screening snack bar and air conditioning so that was good full flight back with the same crew as we had flying in that morning again friendly smiles take off and landing on time overall a nice little airline but expensive 250 roundtrip for a 45 minute flight but beats a 9hour one way bus ride
18906,spicejet,2,delayed both ways by many hours,flight was delayed both ways by many hours poor service for the same price as other airlines like indigo no wifi or other amenities to compensate for terrible service
2144,air malta,1,demand one straight answer,after our flight on the 7th of june 2020 was cancelled due to covid restrictions we had to reschedule our flight to the 8th of august 2021 unfortunately at the last minute malta changed its covid regulations not recognising a covid recovery certificate as viable due to this we had to request a refund which i completed at the start of august 2020 on the 31st of january 2022 my refund was processed the company requested i provide them with my banking information so that they could transfer the funds i already provided them with my banking information the moment i bought a ticket through the airline since the 31 st of january i have contacted air malta call centre more than 15 times every employee i have on the telephone seems to have a different excuse for why it had not been transferred to my account yet in addition the employees always promise me they will call me back or send me an email however they never do they also claim that they cannot contact any other department within their company via telephone due to company policy which makes its easy for them to delay the truth of my refund status every time i call them i am getting sick and tired of the constant lies and demand one straight answer
20401,thomas cook airlines,5,please try to up your game,thomas cook are offering more and more long haul flights but in comparison to scheduled flights they are terrible if you dont pay the 80 round trip extra to sit together as a couple you end up being split up the headphones you pay for are extra and the films are old ones usual on netflix the meals james martin should be ashamed to put his name too are dried up slop the sandwiches are dried bread with very little filling the price of drinks and snacks are outrageous pleasse if you are trying to go into long haul in a big way they need to include better meals entertainment and perhaps a couple of free drinks they are not really cheaper than most of the schedules and only choose them because they offer more direct flights from manchester please try to up your game and stop charging for so many extras the difference in price between thomas cook and british airways to barbados is negligible but the service is enormous the only reason for choosing tc is that they fly from manchester
15425,olympic air,7,olympic air customer review,lhrath new a320 aircraft was clean but grey and gloomy food surprisingly good good coffee by airline standards service excellent the return flight was another new a320 whose blue seats gave economy class a feeling of being a cut above budgetairline equivalents food and service of a high standard although trays could have been cleared away sooner and the aircraft was rather warm checkin for both flights was a breeze olympic air has made a promising start with a new impression of efficiency that will be a revelation to anyone familiar with its predecessor but london to athens is a most competitive routes and at the moment aegean still edges it offering inflight entertainment where oa had none a surprising omission and its own magazine aside from a oneoff souvenir magazine commemorating oas heritage oas magazine is in fact that of the parent company mig beefed up with oaspecific content and is in greek only furthermore the frequent plugging of migs other brands was seriously offputting even it did mean free biscuits promoting its food arm hearing thank you flying olympic air part of marfin investment group at the end of the flight is a surefire way to drain the glamour out of the olympic brand name and any remaining romance out of flying altogether nobody loves a conglomerate so a bit more subtlety would go a long way ill keep my eye on oa in the future but for the time being will probably continue to choose aegean for this route
9328,fiji airways,2,our flight got cancelled,labasa to nadi our flight got cancelled on the 5th of jan from labasa to nadi due to bad weather we made about 30 phone calls to fiji link both in suva and nadi each time a different story was told absolutely no help has been provided we were meant to be back at work today its 3 days now we asked fiji link to give us a date when we could travel back to brisbane so that we can inform work fiji link failed to do that as well no supplimentary flights have been arrangedwe have not received a single phone calltext or email to say they are making arrangements to fly us out asap we even went down to the local airport only to find locals travelling out of the island how about those who are visitors here and have to return to work and attend to medical appointmentsthey fail to answer questions and are not supportive at all
604,aeromexico,1,just ignoring my refund messages,i bought a ticket for a flight from ecuador to russia with aeromexico and air france the day after the purchase i received a letter that one of the flights was changed the new route was not suitable for me because i do not have a visa to europe and i was not able to fly on the new changed route in this connection an involuntary refund was issued the money for which the airline does not want to return today is march 7th 2022 and support is just ignoring my refund messages
13082,kulula,5,low cost that gives a fair service,durban to johannesburg with kulula nice to be honest simple planes old but crew were nice and not aggressive flight on time a low cost airline that gives a fair service fast check in 45 minute normal flight plenty of space for the bags
5750,blue islands,5,blue islands customer review,jergcijer what a great service a user friendly website which is not full of tricks and gimmicks to cost you money and all fares fully flexible change as often as you like without any fee online check in up to 48 hours in advance a little cumbersome but it works and a small lounge at the airport for all passengers with drinks and biscuits i dont really think one can expect more on a 10 minute flight friendly and relaxed staff but obviously professional and rather like flying in the old days in light aircraft a lot of fun
3434,airasia x,8,professional and pleasant,red eye flight from kuala lumpur to perth on 17 april the flight leaves at 0005 and arrives into perth at 0530 boarding was shambolic as there was one lady in charge up front and she spoke fast and her speech was so unclear that nobody understood her and everyone just got up and boarded anyway it was storming before takeoff so we waited on the tarmac after boarding in the middle of a thunderstorm the flat seat was comfortable and they provide a duvet and a large pillow for sleep you are given a small complimentary bottle of water and a tablet with noise cancelling headphones the tablet is loaded with a limited number of movies and tv shows and lasts about 4 hours i dont understand why they serve you food at 0030 i was not given a choice just handed a tray of food after takeoff instead of serving it before landing the cabin crew were very professional and pleasant but boarding announcements were appalling as the purser was a japanese man and although no fault of his his accent could not be understood by virtually anyone on the aircraft quizzical looks all around all in all they were punctual efficient and pleasant one drawback they turn on the lights about an hour before landing when we easily could have had an extra 30 minutes of sleep points to improve your staff need elocution lessons on clear speech
12320,jetstar airways,4,we lost a day of our easter break,after we had checked in given up our bag and gone through security we received a text from jetstar flight cancelled due to engineering reasons better safe than sorry i get it but it was the easter long weekend there were no other flights available until the next day it took us an hour to get our bag back and we lost a day of our easter break on the following day the automatic checkin was quick and easy service from the ground and cabin staff was good the plane operated 40 mins late it would have been sensible to leave passengers in the public area of the main terminal for that time so they could get food and go to the toilet but jetstar called us all down to the already crowded departure area to spend the time milling about and trying to work out if there was a queue seats were comfortable if basic the airlines takeon bag policy was not enforced the cabin crew were imploring passengers who had done the right thing to put their bags under the seat in front of them in order to make room in the overhead racks for the suitcasesize bags that the airline had allowed on board
1435,air china,3,not be flying air china again,los angeles to singapore with a layover in beijing quick dirty difficult to book flight online booking only no mobile app aircraft dirty cloth seats dirty monitor stolen luggage lock lost luggage bad communication this was by far the most nerve wrecking booking experience ive ever had i travel frequently and decided to fly air china despite the bad reviews and of course because of the lower price wont do that again i literally had to book the flight 3 times online because for some reason my transaction didnt go through i know this because i called customer service after being on hold for at least 20 minutes and was informed youd think that would be enough to make me do an aboutface the aircraft had cloth seats with touch monitors that did not respond to touch it wouldnt be so bad if i werent on a 12 hour flight the monitors and tray tables were visibly dirty but im not trippin because most aircraft are whether visible or invisible so i brought my handydandy antibacterial wipes we were a lost luggage victim as well luggage didnt even leave lax thank god the luggage arrived in singapore 24 hours later our luggage lock wasnt on our luggage we sat on the tarmac for 15 hours before takeoff in beijing no explanation given until about an hour of sitting and waiting needless to say we will not be flying air china again
14144,lufthansa,3,definitely not worth it,upgraded to business class through last minute bid paid amount was acceptable but definitely not worth it except for the priority boarding and free middle seat next to you very tasteful but extremely tiny portion food offered on this 15 hr flight during dinner time the portion wasnt even enough as an appetiser drink selection was perfectly adequate though wonder who pays full fare for such product
1915,air india express,7,staff service was good,delhi to dubai seats were comfortable and had good leg space the air conditioning and cabin lights were good the staff service was good the food provided was a snacks box but for the price we booked its justified flight took off late by 50 minutes that was a disappointment
8994,etihad airways,6,affordable but not glamourous,we flew etihad to rome fiumicino and back via abu dhabi it was good but not great when we got the airport check in was smooth however we had booked a bulkhead seats for all flights for my dads 50th but since they changed the plane from a 7879 to a 777300 meaning that we couldnt access the bulkheads seats and the etihad staff were rude and refused to give a refund and we had to pay more for fees the plane was older than expected inflight entertainment screens were tricky and average quality and it was showing its age food on both flights were bland and repetitive meat rice and veggies but they offered drinks consistently the layover in abu dhabi was terrible and lines were long the second leg from abu dhabi to rome the 787 was better and easier to sleep in overall etihad is affordable but not glamourous
3535,airbaltic,8,would recommend and book again,not bad if you can find a flight at the right price point return flight arndxb via riga okay lets get the worse thing out of the way one toilet for a 720 hour flight does not make the grade on the positive side all flights were on time equipment is new both check in and cabin staff were better than average and price was exceptional compared with the premium carriers no luggage police were on duty unlike ryanair seats a tad uncomfortable for the duration but reasonable legroom would recommend and book again
1055,air berlin,3,wouldnt recommend it,hurghada to munich as somebody who flies various times per year i can say that this was the worst flight ive ever been on first of all the positive the service was unexpectedly well on a four hour flight they served alcoholic beverages and some snacks for free what is not usual these days on low cost airlines the worst part of the whole flight were the cramped seats im 198 m tall 66ft tall so i couldnt find any comfortable position my knees hurt and i didnt have any space to rest my legs asked at the check in for a emergency exit rowseat they wanted to charge me 39eur what is unjustifiable towards clients of my height so i spent three hours standing in front of the toilets to avoid pain this was the first and last time ive booked air berlin if they arent able to provide decent space or service for tall costumers i see no reason to pay for a flight with them wouldnt recommend it
23028,xl airways france,6,pilot did an excellent job,after reading all the reviews about xl airways and learning that they have 34 planes in their entire fleet i was extremely anxious we arrived at jfk 3 hours early and were among the first in line to check in after waiting in line for an hour we made it to the counter where our back bags and checked bags were carefully weighed thank goodness we were all underneath the required mass the plane was boarded and we we got on the electricity went completely out but in a few minutes we were on our way the pilot did an excellent job piloting the plane and even though we took off late we made it close to our normal time after spending a few days in paris we went back to check in to our return flight but they had already boarded and we missed our flight we tried calling customer service but only got a recording and wasnt until the next day that we found out we would have to purchase a one way ticket home on the way back after checking in for our one way flight back to the us the woman at the counter was not sympathetic just said so sorry we did make it home safely and once again the pilot did an excellent job bottom line i would take this airline again but make sure that i made the flight next time because you will not be compensated or offered a discount by the way i thought the food served on board was really good we were served breakfast about an hour before our flight landed in paris and dinner an hour or so into our flight on the way back
13307,lan airlines,6,aircraft was clean,flew from juliaca peru to lima with lan airlines the plane was ok the flight was 1 hour and 10 minutes late due to delay of lim airport departure they offered us a complimentary hamburger while we were waiting the aircraft was clean and the service was standard food was only crackers and nuts plus drinks staff were standard and tired apart from offering the burger the airline was not as expected the 3 stars does not reflect the service that we had on arrival to lim we waited 15 minutes to disembark through the bridge
5105,azerbaijan airlines,8,very comfortable seats,tel aviv to new york jfk via baku return with azerbaijan airlines excellent service and also the plane kosher food is not special very comfortable seats on the boeing 787 aircraft flight entertainment quite okay flight attendants with excellent service and wait in baku pretty good
19923,thai airasia,8,pleasant flight,pleasant airasia flight from don mueang to udon thani left on time pleasant flight i had a recent operation and needed some assistance the staff went out of their way to help me so grateful
7609,corsair,7,good service in business class,paris orly to pointepitre good service in business class 222 layout 12 business class seats in total the outbound flight was quiet so each business class passenger had two seats on hisher own food was good though i thought they served the 2nd meal a bit too late as i was getting a bit too hungry inbound flight business class cabin was full service was a bit more hurried but was still good and acceptable there was only one toilet in business class and at times there was a wait as several passengers from premium economy were coming forward to use the business class toilet i have no problem with this but corsair should probably have 2 toilets in the business class cabin if it is too be shared with premium economy the music albums in their entertainment system were surprisingly shocking i did know any of the artists and i happen to follow french songsmusic for a french airline not to have any mainstream artists like matt pokora shym amel bent or more seasoned stars like julien clerc who happens to have connections with guadeloupe as well is quite surprising
19814,tap portugal,2,baggage never made it,i flew on tap portugal our flight was delayed due to air conditioning problems which made us miss our connecting flight in order to make wedding i had to take 2 additional flights to barcelona plus aircraft was extremely hot baggage never made it to barcelona and was returned to my home address a week after i returned from spain tap said they would reimburse us for our trip and still have not and they keep closing our complaint
22982,xiamen airlines,5,meals were exactly the same,flew from amsterdam to tokyo via xiamen on xiamen airlines no seat reservation or online checkin is possible with this airline the klm ground staff were unaware of the transit procedure in xmn they told us to tag our bags to nrt but apparently it had to be picked up in xmn to be checkedin again the flight on the dreamliner to xmn was good loadfactor about 40 so a whole row of seats for myself food was served 1 hour after takeoff and 5 hours after takeoff on both services meals were exactly the same didnt see the crew for the last 5 hours of the flight entertainment system had hiccups all the time and wifi was not available on frame b2769 flight was on time transfer procedure at xmn is troublesome crew on the plane told us not to fill out the immigration form since we were only transiting at the immigration we were send back to the end of the queue to fill out the immigration form we also had to deliver a paper version of the ticket with our names to the immigration which we did not have they didnt thrust the itinerary in the checkmytrip app after a lot of discussion they provided us the 24hours visa for china dont follow the signs to the departure hall immediately if you have a long layover the checkin desks are located in a secure area without any restaurants or shops checkin was opened 2 hours before departure and we couldnt get back to other parts of the airport from security so waiting on some steel couches for a few hours without anything to do the flight to nrt on an old and worn b738 was delayed for 90 minutes sitting on the tarmac without airconditioning for 60 minutes no reason for the delay was given food was good on this flight however i had a bad experience on the flight from nrt to xmn it was said to be a non smoking flight but not for the crew all of a sudden the seatbelt signs went on without any obvious reason and the smell of cigarette smoke appeared from the airconditioning system after 5 minutes the smell of smoke disappeared and the fast seatbelt sign was switched off again this happened 3 times on the 4 hour flight having learned from my previous transfer at xmn it went smoother this time altough not possible to buy food at xmn since creditcards were not accepted and the atms were out of order the flight to ams on the 787 was packed this time chinese people carry lots of hand luggage so overhead bins filled up quickly i skipped the first meal because i wanted to sleep the flight did arrive on time in amsterdam
14471,malaysia airlines,2,far away from what you have hoped,changes not allowed flight delay redeemed my flight ticket using enrich points for return trip from kuala lumpur to kota kinabalu using malaysia airlines i am a platinumemerald on one world but my experience with malaysia airline is is bad mh has gone to a low class airline my flight at 2040 and checked in at 1700 i asked if i can board the 1820 flight or 1930 flight but was not allowed as the redemption ticket is not changeable i am not able to pay to change and was offered to buy another ticket if i want to see this is the kind of airline that is cheap there were seats and plenty but no flexibility and consideration so i question why should i ever accumulate enrich or fly on mh then come to boarding time at 1940 plane arrived at 2010 and two announcements made i 2020h that flight is delayed due to operational reason and passengers will be updated in 20 mins time ii 2043h that flight is delayed and passengers be updated in 20 mins time malaysian hospitality is a far away from what you have hoped there are much to be learnt and catch up
7240,cityjet,1,cityjet customer review,with the intention of saving a little money i was again brought back to reality and had to realize that it is probably better to pay a little more for an airline where the costs are not hidden in the dirty details travelling with a child under two years i was glad to see that cityjet charges only 3 eur for the child travelling on your lap concerning the fact that we had to check in one bag which costs an extra 15 eur when doing it during online checkin completely ok i tried to checkin online as offered by the airline stupid enough that during this process i get the information that online checkin is not possible when travelling with a child under the age of two this bumped the costs of our checkedin bag up to 30 eur because we had to do it at the airport with two flights this makes 30 extra euro just because we were travelling with a child on our lap not occupying a seat so in fact the child was travelling for 33 eur cityjet states in its policies that every child under the age of two may carry one piece of baggage up to 10 kg a stroller and a car seat when we arrived at the airport we were told that only the stroller was allowed neither the car seat nor the 10 kg bag could be taken on the airplane unless we paid for it i will never travel with cityjet again
3569,airbaltic,3,indifferent and unsmiling,athens to hamburg via riga red eye flight on a220300 plane looks nice but noisy for such a modern plane you could have slept from 46 in the morning but the noise was bothering you flight attendants were indifferent and unsmiling they do not offer even a glass of water or coffee you have to buy everything
12007,jet airways,5,a very bad experience,flew delhi to lucknow with jet airways a very bad experience to interact with their customer support experience will try to never go with this airline again although they provide low fares dealing with them is too costly try to avoid booking if you value your time
18081,silkair,3,very disappointing,singapore to kunming very disappointing for a full service airline and not worth being called the regional wing of singapore airlines seats were very similar in space and comfort to budget carriers such as jetstar i am 190cm tall and my knees were really digging into the seat in front of me not what you would expect of a full service airline although the boeing 737800 was less than a year old the seats were already showing signs of wear greying and tattered for a 4hr flight to kunming this was almost unbearable food was also not up to standard i would expect a full meal service from silkair on such a long flight however the meal was very small and barely enough for this sector there are only 2 toilets available for the 150odd passengers in economy together with the slow meal service this caused the rear of the aircraft to be constantly congested i feel sorry for those seated in the vicinity of the toilet as they had to deal with people squeezing in the narrow aisle and eating into their already limited personal space inflight entertainment is also poor not only is there no in seat ife the wifi ife system is also very limited in content the content that it did have was not recent nor popular worst of all the prices paid for the flight are full singapore airlines fares and that sours the whole experience silkair is far from the standard of singapore airlines and that should not be the case
20859,transavia,8,overall cant really complain,booked klm cork to seville via amsterdam with amsterdam seville legs flown with transavia overall cant really complain they are effectively the charter leg of klm and as such pretty much like most charters unlike klm legs any food drink was purchase only didnt buy anything but prices were reasonable seats were pretty standard legroom not great not poor i kinda liked the green leather though some may find it a bit garish most reviews not great but i found them fine on time crews were again really friendly and polite worked hard to help passengers find luggage space also special mention to the transavia guy in seville who noticed my lad had a football he had purchased he told us it needed to be deflated a little to compensate for aircraft pressure we had nothing to deflate it with but he asked a lady in the check in queue for her hair clip and then spent 10 minutes using this to get it deflated much to the amusement of the waiting passengers all done with a smile so while others may have issues we had a positive experience so feel that deserves to be said i travel a lot and often think we are very quick to criticise myself included but when things go well then maybe not so quick to acknowledge
16588,qatar airways,2,changed me to aisle seat 8g,i got my tkt 11 months ago biz class from doha to so paulo selected window seat 8k a month ago i checked my reservation and all correct today checking in they had changed me to aisle seat 8g without any communication with me only window seat left is 11l
22401,volaris,1,never again will i fly with volaris,never again will i fly with volaris trust me spend the extra cash to get a genuine on time flight not only do you have to pay for extra which includes bags seats and much more but the hassle of flying with them is not worth it the crew is ok a mediocre job for a mediocre airline my flight was just under two hours late of the boarding time but that was enough to make me write a review i have never felt more disappointed in an airline than volaris the plane arrive late but within 15 minutes we were already boarding which is good only if you like sitting in nasty chip crumbs filled seats that arent even properly sanitized i guess thats why covid was such a problem in mexico
1070,air berlin,8,onboard service was very good,first time in business class on air berlin from chicago to berlin seats are lie flat but quite narrow and also short on length in the flat position i had to bend my legs or have feet jammed against the end of the seat the crew food and drinks and onboard service was very good would definitely fly them again
19943,thai airasia,6,eliminate the recline button,chiang mai to hanoi over 6 foot tall book an exit seat although cramped the interior was fresh and bright the cabin crew professional and polite and even the lavatories were clean if only they would eliminate the recline button on the seats unfortunately there are still travelers that just dont consider fellow passengers when it comes to leg room
19679,tam airlines,1,the most dysfunctional airline,tam airlines is the most dysfunctional airline i have ever encountered anywhere in the world on many trips through brazil i have flown tam with relatively few headaches however in september 2015 my opinion has changed drastically in short their website is dysfunctional and buggy they dont have english speaking phone support and even worse their website lists ticket offices in rio de janeiro that dont exist anymore its impossible to change or rebook a ticket without horrendous timewasting hassles and expensive overseas phone calls to brazilian numbers tam has no telephone support in english to assist with basic needs like reticketing you must call a lan phone number to request an english speaker and then wait for someone to call you back in my case i waited more than three days for someone to call me emails to customer service went unanswered and a phone rep later told me that their customer service department responds to emails within thirty days im not kidding and although they replied via twitter they would only direct me to the same phone service that could provide what i needed a changed ticket in the midst of this frustration i decided to visit a ticket office in person i spent an hour to travel to an address thats currently listed on the tam website for a ticket office in ipanema after arriving i found a sign on the door saying that they had moved and the new office location was closed that day a saturday infuriating if youre an overseas traveler who is traveling in brazil and you dont speak portuguese i strongly suggest that you fly another airline tams horror stories are plentiful and until they make major systemic changes i wont be flying them again
2088,air macau,3,so hot it was unbearable,we were on air macau flight from osaka to macau in the winter the weather in both osaka and macau were very cold at the time yet the cabin temperature was almost 30 degree celsius it was so hot that it was unbearable several passengers reflect the issue to the flight attendants yet nothing was done it was like sitting in the baking oven it was the worst 4 hour flight i have experienced there were apparent difference in temperature between front section and rear section of the cabin much hotter in the front and mid section maybe thats why the flight attendant who were staying in the back did not take passengers request seriously cabin temperature is so important for passenger comfort and so simple to correct it should also match the weather condition of the departure location
17446,sa express,8,sa express customer review,flew sa express jnbwdh check in was fairly quick there is no separate line for alliance silvergold boarding was via bus they boarded the bus and then made us wait 30 mins as the plane was not ready even though it was cold outside the bus did get stuffy we then had to wait another 15 mins by the plane before we could board the crj200 has 22 seating which was comfortable for the 2 hr flight a cold breakfast box was offered which was excellent it had cereal fruit yoghurt cold cuts cheese etc very substantial also teacoffee and soft drinks were served there is no ife service was good and efficient overall very pleasant flight experience
20505,thomson airways,5,crew were fairly efficient,the product is pretty good quality of food excellent drinks were good the crew were fairly efficient but lacked any warmth overall it was ok but most of the crew were unapproachable and gave the impression that you were inconveniencing them when visiting the galley to ask for anything not what you expect in a premium cabin the inflight entertainment was ok but the movie selection was quite limited and the only music was a couple of preset playlists that you couldnt skip through there are no control handsets so everything is controlled from the touch screen which even when the seat is in the upright position means you have to stretch your arm to reach you have to lean forward when reclined introduction of the 787 was supposed to eradicate things like the rude awakening for breakfast before landing that previous aircraft did where the cabin lights are either on or off we still got that awakening when the crew just switched the lights straight onto full brightness rather than gradual brightening that on most new aircraft i think that thomsons premium product has a way to go to match up the mainline operators they compete with it doesnt just end at operating shiny new aircraft
8859,ethiopian airlines,6,staff at chennai must be polite with customers,as per new rules they follow passengers who traveling on ethiopian airlines must hold return ticket only with ethiopian airlines to get boarding pass actually my return ticket was with qatar airways if they follow the rules should inform very earlier to passengers those who travel in ethiopian airlines ground staff at chennai who are responsible to explain the reason why they denied to issue boarding pass must be polite with customers
20766,titan airways,9,no hesitation flying with them again,returning to gatwick from genoa after a cruise and didnt realise that titan airways were operating for british airways until we boarded the flight felt a bit nervous having not heard of this operator before however after a brief introduction of who titan airways were and details of the flight route and weather conditions the crew and cabin staff were excellent this flight on an a320 was one of the best i have been on no hesitation flying with them again
20169,thai lion air,1,ended up cancelling the flight,bangkok to taipei first it is very hard to get the customer service to reply by email or phone once you are luck to reach them by phone you will find out the process reschedule or cancellation is horrible i ended up cancelling the flight as i am tired of listening to all those unprofessional customer representative that probably trained to put the best interest of the company instead of being realistic and fair to the customers the cancellation process is horrible that you have to send the passport and flight details again which they should have those info already i will never book the flight from thai lion air as this is my first time to book and the experience of booking reschedule cancellation and customer service are all really bad that i can not imagine the experience of getting on the flight
10309,georgian airways,7,very impressed,gatwick to tbilisi return first flights on georgian airways very impressed check in at gatwick and tbilisi was polite and efficient take off from gatwick on time staff efficient but a little austere probably language barrier food was good seat was generous with good legroom especially on way back return flight delayed 1 hour but we were informed of this immediately on check in staff on the flight back were very good good food and drink it is true there is no inflight entertainment but who really misses this on a 5 hour flight read a book on the return i spent most of the time looking out of the window or dozing at the height we were at you could see the cities of romania bulgaria germany and so on lit up very entertaining plus clouds illuminated by lightning i have not seen this from above before
930,air austral,4,my flight was very unpleasant,i have flown with the airline at least six flights in the last three years so far i am pleased with the airlines punctuality and the services of flight attendants on board unfortunately my 2019 flight in 23 june was very unpleasant started from at least the 15hour delay of the flight and there was not at all any special offer on board the delay caused me to pay more at the hotel the latest flight in july was terrible boeing 7878 was booked but a330 i was in headache during the flight and asked for pills from the attendant but it was ignored terrible
7505,copa airlines,3,six people to figure out how to charge my bag,it took copa almost an hour for no less than six people to figure out how to charge my bag and issue the receipt for it when i mentioned that an apology would have made the situation easier they said i would probably be angry even if they had apologized i guess you cant expect much from an airline that only serves a tiny bag of pltain chips as a meal in an international flight
20073,thai airways,2,this is no customer service and low quality of cabin crew,thai airways did better than this last time i have asked cabin crew for window seat because the check in staff did mentioned to check with the crew after i have spoken to one of the lady crew she promised that she will get back to me but nothing was said another male cabin crew was supposed to pass my bf the chicken rice after the food was served my bf waited for a long time until another side of the crew was asking and passed to my bf instead he did not apologise and ignored at least for any follow up and empathy for passengers this is no customer service and low quality of cabin crew
9522,firefly,8,firefly customer review,this is the second time ive flown firefly great little airline with friendly flight attendants the cabin was very clean and the flight deck crew kept us well informed the ticket prices are cheaper if you book on their website
27,adria airways,3,underwhelming and unimpressive,ljubljana to amsterdam first experience with adria airways was underwhelming and unimpressive flight sat on tarmac fully boarded for 20 minutes without explanation causing 20 minute delay on arrival without comment from crew and despite many passengers with tight connections in ams crew was the least personal ive experienced in my 30 flights in 2016 the crew quickly passed through the cabin holding a large bottle of water but without offering it everything else is buyonboard at unappealing prices aging crj900 showed its wear limited onair entertainment but able to select bulkhead seat at checkin so legroom was good compared to inbound flight on air france adria lacked any sort of the polished personal touch that its inflight magazine claims it wants to project to lju however the options are few and the schedules erratic so adria will often be the only rational choice for many sectors
15658,openskies,8,openskies customer review,excellent value for money even though the plane was quite old the flight was very smooth the old seats were very comfortable i slept all flight long from ny to paris the food is good enough and the service on board from paris to ny was great at this price range its a very good solution for a comfortable flight to ny or paris i will definitely use openskies again
10375,germanwings,3,i was refused some water,i am less than impressed with germanwings service to say the least on my first connection to hamburg the stewardess has told us that we could have some water for free while everything has to be charged during my second connection from hamburg to london i was refused some water despite being pregnant and not feeling well i find this disgusting the fact that a passenger will not be offered water if theyre unwell and will not be looked after in any way needless to say the stewards would only be nice to the passengers who have also booked their on board meals or bought on board drinks
15630,onur air,9,onur air customer review,liverpool to dalaman cabin crew were pleasant and enough seat room plane was cleaner than previous flights with other budget airlines no entertainment but going out was a night flight so just slept coming back piped music played throughout the flight i would have no hesitation in recommending onur air
16684,regional express,1,value for money this airline is terrific,my return trip from melbourne to sydney was outstanding rex ground and flight crew were efficient helpful and friendly value for money this airline is terrific there are no hidden extras when you book and you actually pay the price that was advertised rex have a full covid 19 refund policy which is easy to access within days of requesting a refund after melbournes last lockdown the money was back in my account i cant rate rex highly enough this airline is the real deal
19727,tam airlines,8,tam airlines customer review,flight jj8064 sao paolo to madrid march 30th 2014 having read some very poor reviews we were a little nervous when our agent recommended this flight however we were pleasantly surprised staff were friendly and helpful the food was not quite up to lan standards but more than acceptable and served with some very nice wines the seats were not quite lieflat but comfortable enough and we were given nice duvets and pillows the little flight pack was well put together and useful especially the warm socks business class lounge in sao paolo was ok not great and we gave up trying to connect to the wifi it was nice and quiet though the flight arrived 30mins early in madrid and the bags arrived quickly they have a bit of a way to go to catch up with lan but would say that they are getting there
1250,air canada rouge,8,the service was excellent,the flight was affordable and a good value for money the service was excellent the seats were spacious and comfortable for economy compared to other airlines there were no screens in the seats and charging ports were tough to find as they were at the bottom of the seats however in flight movies through our phones was good along with the wifi and texting in flight for free for aeroplan members was a nice luxury for economy our pilot heather was awesome very comfortable take off and landing
16325,privilege style,5,the flight was okay,munich to kabul privilege style is flying this 25 year old boeing 767 on behalf of other customers as a charter airline the flight was okay seats are comfortable enough and i felt safe throughout the journey
17919,shanghai airlines,4,shanghai airlines customer review,shanghai pudong guilin shanghai hongqiao beijing generally not really satisfied with the service i wonder how come they can be admitted into the star alliance food poor fas service poor as well neither asian hospitality or smiles shown by fa when distributing the food fa even show a gesture of throwing the box of the food instead of serving it nicely shanghai beijing flight was delayed quite badly seat pitch and comfort just reasonable not really satisfying along with china eastern is not a really good choice to fly
6593,cathay pacific airways,9,made my trip one of my best,i was already seated inside the aircraft and noticed i left my jacket with my wallet inside it at the boarding gate i explained the situation to one of the flight crew and she accompanied me to the waiting lounge she made my trip one of my best trips
1985,air italy,7,clean and tidy aircraft,new york to milan good flight clean and tidy aircraft poor ife and bad headphones good meals but with a poor presentation friendly staff with some ups and downs they have to improve in some places in order to balance the best competition
1494,air dolomiti,3,lost baggage reports is disgraceful,air dolomitis customer service and handling lost baggage reports is disgraceful and is a display of the ultimate incompetence of one airline to its customers belongings on a long business trip after a flight from frankfurt to verona the bag is missing for almost two weeks air dolomiti is putting not even a minor effort to find it or at least reply all the emails all you can get from air dolomiti after following their lost and found procedures from their website and submitting all their claim forms baggage content forms and costs reimbursement forms is a generic email reply which gives you no updates no reimbursement confirmation no deadlines no phone number to call they just dont want to bother very frustrating for any traveller as their customers
1721,air france,1,never fly air france again,customer service on the phone were both incompetent and rude took 4 days of being told to call back in 24h and receiving no help every person we spoke to at the check in desk and ticketing sales was nasty air france customer service at lax is awful one older french woman at ticketing sales was aggressive in her rudeness my partner and i will never fly air france again it was such an upsetting experience considering how much we paid
3923,alitalia,6,sky priority boarding not respected,rome to brindisi in brindisi and in rome sky priority boarding is not respected when passenger have to be transported by bus from the airport to the aircraft on contrary in the airport of verona once sky priority passengers are in the bus they are in a segregated area from the rest of the passengers and once the bus reach the aircraft first the bus doors of the area where sky priority passengers are segregated and so they can board first it is advised that similar practice is implemented in other airports where alitalia operates
1924,air india express,4,flights are delayed,chennai to trivandrum many air india express flights are delayed by more than 1 hour and today the same happened this is frustrating 2hr delay in boarding flight and again 30 minutes delay in getting check in baggage please improve your service and value customers time
7797,csa czech airlines,3,my seat was dirty,madrid to odessa via prague disappointed on the first flight we waited 45 minutes in the jet bridge due to the plane being cleaned well when we got in my seat was dirty and there were crumbs all over the place however we did order the inflgiht meal and it was amazing if you do fly with this airline i recommend buying an onboard meal our second flight was delayed by four hours departing at 2 am once we got to our destination we waited another hour for our luggage by the time we left the airport the sun was already up
23087,yangon airways,8,all in all a good flight,bagan to heho very short flight again another atr aircraft as a nervous passenger i was not looking forward to the flight but it was great seating was 22 no seat numbers given as only a few passengers on this flight no inflight snack but coffee or cold drinks were supplied all in all a good flight and would travel again
19703,tam airlines,5,tam airlines customer review,eze to gru in business class on 330 airbus seat recline worked intermittently and ife had to be constantly rebooted so it was impossible to watch anything no apologies from staff no announcement made on arrival of the local time and we had a connecting flight and i hadnt noted that brazil was an hour ahead of argentina business lounges are not of the same standard as other oneworld carriers at gru we changed planes 777300 to lhr staff on this flight were more attentive and courteous ife worked but volume level at max was still too quiet breakfast order is taken in advance and nicely presented business seat was long enough for me but not for husband whose feet were trapped under the seat in front i found the seat to be hard not bad quality for price paid
3761,akasa air,3,seats have been changed,we have booked total 3 tickets windows my only concern is our seats have been changed without informing or asking us later when we asked for the reason they made us to wait for few minutes and a senior guy came with new boarding pass and started yelling that he never seen passengers like us his point was i gave you a business class 3 seats in a row and why dont you want it my point is we dont care about class why we want windows seat of our actually paid seats the conversation ended with his words telling i never seen passenger like you me telling well you have seen now even at last moment i got a window in economy class which is two rows behind my actual seats very lame of the kind of response which he have bottom line everyone dont ask for business class its their responsibility to make sure passengers get the seats which they have booked and if there is some conflict they should let the passengers know before changing it
17059,royal jordanian airlines,4,food itself was incredibly disappointing,i recently had the unfortunate experience of flying on royal jordanian airlines and i must say it was a major 12hr flight letdown not only were the ticket prices high but the food itself was incredibly disappointing i expected much more from an airline that claims to offer a premium experience the overall taste and quality were also highly disappointing as someone who enjoys flavorful cuisine this was a major letdown i anticipated a delightful culinary journey but unfortunately it was far from it to make matters worse the portion sizes were incredibly small i understand the constraints of serving food on an airplane but the amount provided was hardly enough to satisfy even a moderately hungry passenger it felt like an afterthought rather than a carefully planned meal furthermore the lack of creativity in the breakfast offerings was disappointing the meals lacked innovation and seemed to be basic standard choices that did not leave a lasting impression as a passenger i believe it is important to have a breakfast experience that is not only nourishing but also enjoyable and memorable considering the ticket prices associated with royal jordanian airlines i expected a more diverse and enticing meals other airlines manage to provide a wider range of choices unfortunately royal jordanian airlines fell short in this aspect finally the combination of high ticket prices and subpar food left me feeling dissatisfied and regretful of my choice if youre someone who values quality dining during your travels i would strongly advise exploring alternative airlines that prioritize culinary excellence
6561,cathay dragon,9,inflight experience was pleasant,hong kong to kota kinabalu i had a superb and memorable flight with cathay dragon from hong kong to kota kinabalu there was a long queue as when i arrived at the cathay dragon check in counter in hong kong but i had a swift check in process priority boarding was given to passenger who requires special attention and business class passengers followed by economy class this flight was operated by a320200 registration bhsu i was greeted by as i boarded the aircraft and guided to the assigned seat inflight meal served approximately half an hour after take off breakfast with a choice of sausages with omelette and chicken with noodles the omelette is delicious in flight meal serving process was efficient cabin crew was available to serve hot beverages based on my observation and flying experience with cathay dragon the meal portion has been resized to smaller portion since last year i would suggest cathay dragon reconsider re introduce cakes into meal tray again overall inflight experience was pleasant i look forward for more flight with cathay dragon in the near future
15650,openskies,5,declining quality of service,openskies used to be a great option from new york jfk to paris orly but aging planes crummy and continuously declining quality of service and food doesnt make it a worthwhile option anymore you used to be treated like a human but now its just a bigger seat there are better options out there i guess this was an expected outcome once the big british airways took over
12572,jetstar pacific,8,surprisingly well organised,jetstar pacific from ho chi minh city to da nang and return was surprisingly well organised as usual boarding is disrupted by passengers taking what seat they like instead of the seat allocated maybe a predeparture announcement would overcome this problem as it delays the boarding procedure in several areas before passengers are reseated it is annoying for the other passengers and stressful for the cabin crew to sort out the confusion departure was 15 minutes late for the short flight no tissues or towels in the front toilet was quickly remedied the a320 aircraft seemed new and the cabin attendants young friendly and efficient i understand its a budget airline but charging outlets for phones and ipads would be a real passenger bonus the return trip was also uneventful except for passengers again opting to sit where they want instead of following their boarding pass it was an older aircraft that the outbound trip but still quite clean no trolley service on this night flight but it wasnt missed
11377,icelandair,4,flight was unsatisfactory in several ways,flight 664 from portland oregon was unsatisfactory in several ways my seat could not recline the attendant tried it and said it was broken same with the foot rest the food was unpalatable a few hard overcooked shrimps and an entree of a few strips of dry turkey breast on a mountain of greens just awful i asked for the turkey wrap served in coach flight 671 from reykjavik was an improvement seat reclined food was very good entertainment on both flights was unsatisfactory very limited selection i tried to contact icelandair via email sent to a name on their website but it came back as undeliverable i wont choose icelandair again
17777,scoot,2,was fined a lot at the airport,guangzhou to singapore worst flying experience ever they charged usd 725 during the covid19 time to profit from those who have to fly and even at this price still without regular luggage allowance i have to call them multiple times to buy additional allowance for my second piece of luggage and it turned out to be a nightmare rep is very hard to communicate slow and poor in english it ended up with i failed to buy proper allowance without knowing it and i was fined a lot at the airport
20060,thai airways,8,very pleasant experience,thai airways was an overall very pleasant experience boarding security took half an hour but after it boarding seemed organised and it was smooth seat was very comfortable and a large amount of legroom add this with a 333 config and an adjustable headrest and recline it was very good for economy class staff were very friendly and were greeting people nicely food was tender and delicious probably one of the best economy meals i had ever had in a flight ife fair enough the system was smooth and straightforward but it had less shows and music on average compared with other airlines thai offered charged wifi at reasonable prices was fast enough for browsing or streaming definitely recommend
2669,air nostrum,7,air nostrum customer review,madrid to san sebastian on canadair rj 200 just four business class seats on this 35 minute shorthaul regional flight very friendly and attentive service with free drinks and filled rolls for business oversize hand luggage was put in the hold and could be collected on the tarmac at the destination you wouldnt really pay for business on this regional airline as its not really value for money for such short hops but if you happen to travel in this class then its very pleasant
6853,china airlines,6,crew need to lift their game,my wife and i flew to brisbane from auckland and return a350 was roomy and comfortable in economy class crew were friendly ife with a good selection of movies tv and music crew on return flight indifferent and sour meals were awful spiced chicken and rice worse than a microwavable meal from the supermarket in summary crew need to lift their game english is often poor and engagement nowhere near singapore airlines
8797,estonian air,6,estonian air customer review,athtllath nothing exciting about them but nothing to complain the flight with an old b737300 a nice complimentary sandwich with beverage or water we had ordered and prepaid warm meal we had to prove that we had paid to give us the meal even though the trays had our names printed on them the younger stewardshostesses were nice and pleasant the older ones were living in the communist era of transportation excellent airport of tallin new clean friendly convenient but underused too bad only few airlines are using it
1794,air india,6,i would still recommend,as i had booked this flight at a discount rate i was a bit anxious about whether i would get a seat on this flight considering it was the weekend and planes have been flying full literally to my surprise i didnt have to wait for long in order to check in and get my boarding pass the flight boarding and departure were on time and there were a few vacant seats for breakfast i opted for the veg option which was consisting of an uttapam sev upma a croissant with mango yogurt which was pretty good however during the beverage service i noticed that the staff were initially serving the front couple of rows but then due to turbulence they had to stop it midway but didnt bother to proactively ask the passengers for beverages when they were taking away the eating trays which was a surprise perhaps they might have just forgotten or due to the turbulence they had to stop it midway without asking passengers but either way that wasnt good arrival to mumbai was on time however i had noticed that upon retrieval of my luggage my baggage name tag that i had put had got torn out which was not good as previously back in january too they had misplaced my luggage and again they had not handled the baggage properly so this is something that they need to look into i would still recommend as i got huge value for the fare that i paid
20029,thai airways,6,no one will reply to emails,from great to not so good the main issues have to do with communication ive sent several emails and not one has been followed up this is especially bad because there is no one to phone in the uk i tried calling thailand and waited 20 minutes on international hold when i tried to talk about the issue at the airport they referred me to email phone pretty bad and beware when changing your flight you will need to pay the cost to change your flight of course plus if you paid for a seat upgrade you will not get the original upgrade cost back when you change flights so you will have to pay twice it doesnt say that anywhere i could find and no one will reply to emails or answer the phone
21837,virgin america,4,virgin america customer review,no frills airline everything costs extra no free checked luggage all food and snacks cost money nickle and dime you to death little seats with little leg room they or the connecting airline lost our luggage
20365,thomas cook airlines,7,journey was a little uncomfortable,tenerife to manchester due to a medical circumstance missed my original flight home and could only secure premium economy with thomas cook the following day expensive for 2 one way tickets but no choice really you get a generous baggage allowance 25kg selected seating free drinks on board and a meal the flight boarded on time i was a little taken aback how minimal the legroom was there was no additional space for premium economy whilst i wasnt expecting a suite or a flat bed i was expecting at least an inch extra but no the 4 hour journey was a little uncomfortable thankfully the lady in front didnt recline her seat i would have been in big trouble if she had i dont understand why airlines on short haul europe still have reclining seats with such small leg room provided meal was very tasty and the cabin crew were excellent very friendly and provided a real service not a scratch card sale insight
17291,ryanair,5,flight on time clean cabin,there is a usual ryanair bashing because of their usual tendency to charge everything once you accept it and follow their rules there is no point to complain however in fao we have to wait by 30 degrees celsius standing no seats on the tarmac in a cattle corral style in front of the aircraft during long lasting 20 mn we did not like it on the contrary of many pax we had no kids fortunately flight on time clean cabin
21253,turkish airlines,1,nice food in economy,had and amazing flight with turkish airlines on a one way ticket from antalya via istanbul to london flight was late leaving antalya to istanbul but made up time to get my connection to london full flight from istanbul to london where the crew perform well and was calm and professional nice food in economy which i ask for seconds enjoyable smooth flight and landed in london heathrow bang on time wish i had more time to explore istanbul new airport will definitely fly turkish airlines again
17823,shaheen air,7,shaheen air customer review,although a low cost airline shaheen air was quite nice although the airport checkin was pretty bad with only one line and the agents taking forever the flight had a gate change 4 times and we had a one hour delay announced at the last minute before boarding was to finish the flight attendents were very friendly during the flight and the aircraft was decent also the meal some chicken mayo bun with a chicken leg along with marble cake was pretty delicious and filling the plane was leased and originally from spanair so the cabin had grey leather seats but it was comfortable though also a nice touch from shaheen air was the pretakeoff water which was provided and newspapers in english and urdu
9057,eurowings,1,rudeness in communication,this is most probably the worst airline i have ever traveled with unbelievable i would not even fly with them again if they gave me 1000 euro with it the only reason for me to leave a review is that i hope that i can at least convince one other traveler never to book with eurowings a summary of what happened we travel with our 2 kids 11 and 12 and our seats are completely spread across the plane when checking in via the app you can change your seat to sit next to each other they make you pay for this so no seat upgrade just to sit next to your eleven year old son so we paid no choice but when entering the plane they changed the seat of me and my wife so they made us pay for something that should have just been a standard and then they take it away without apologizing and of course no refund and of course our kids had to travel alone the seats itself are way too small i dont mind seats with ryanair or transavia but this is a completely different league i am 189 meters and it was impossible to get my knees in between my seat and the seat in front of me for the return trip which leaves in 2 days i just found out that we are again seated far away from each other this time it is even impossible to pay for seats next to each other so i called the service line after waiting for over 15 minutes i was helped by lady who told me that see could not seat us together because other passengers already paid extra to sit together and she cannot change seats of passengers who have paid extra when i told her that this is exactly what happens to us on the departing flight she just hang up not only for an airline but just in general i think that the lack of service and the rudeness in communication makes this the worst company i ever came across
19183,sriwijaya air,5,sriwijaya air customer review,i often fly dilidenpasar in comparison to merpati the big thing is that they have newer more comfortable aircrafts otherwise they seem the same as merpati frequent delays allow a lot of time if youre connecting through bali poor ground staff and coordination ok inflight service and meals
16563,qatar airways,5,rather underwhelming experience,both flights were uneventful with the usual good service but declining catering quality there is no butter with the bread for breakfast despite most of the gates at hamad vacant another remote parking position of arriving aircraft with wait for the buses at scorching 38 degrees because of this i had to run for my connecting flight the old 788 on the 2nd leg of the journey was in a rather poor sate and not clean it seems someone has poured red wine over the table and it was still sticky overall a rather underwhelming experience for a carrier charging more than before the pandemic
16841,rossiya airlines,7,rossiya airlines customer review,flew gatwickledovb have used this company a few times and have never had any serious problems flights have always arrived on time food and inflight service very decent however flight was as usual on an old a319 airbus that had seen better days and the legroom was a little tight i am 510 rossiya do not offer echeckin for international flights and you still have to collect and recheck baggage at each transfer which is annoying also still no inflight entertainment they do the important things well but need to modernise their fleet and operations overall very good value for money
13222,kuwait airways,9,the food was delicious,kuwait to dubai i traveled in first class with the new boeing 777300 that was really amazing check in smoothly without trouble stewards are nice entertainment system had a lot of channels the food was delicious the wifi was expensive

18072,silkair,5,seats were very worn,chiang mai to singapore departure and arrival was ontime with no incidents to report staff was friendly and attentive the cabin interior however had seen better days and the seats were very worn also leg space was on the tight side with seating size and comfort similar to a budget airline
3462,airasia x,9,service on board was pleasant,on the 15th december 2017 i travelled from pattaya thailand to jakarta indonesia on air asia i had to change in kuala lumpur for my second and connecting flight the connection was bearable the service on board was pleasant we arrived very early in the morning in jakarta so i had to sleep for a few hours before catching a local bus to jakarta city i always try and fly air asia
10454,germanwings,5,germanwings customer review,lhrcgn cgnlhr flight booked and paid for through lufthansa however if you are a lh senator none of your privileges are available at london airport if flying to kln so was refused admittance to the star alliance gold lounge in t1 flight itself was chaos due to ground handling errors and late final figures but the inflight service was ok if basic return leg from kln was much better able to use the senator lounge and flight punctual i loathe having to use heathrow but there are few options if flying to kln these days
12297,jetsmart,9,value for money was great,puerto montt to santiago the value for money was great we got cheap tickets but the processes were all very efficient no long queues fast checkin and very friendly staff
21786,virgin america,5,the crew looks tired,los angeles to san francisco was due to depart at 1945 from lax the incoming flight from dallas was delayed arriving at 1910 however we could not board until 2010 as the crew from another flight has yet to arrive they only arrive at 2010 and we finally boarded between from 2015 with a final departure time of 2045 luckily my connecting flight was at 0100 the crew was obviously very exhausted this combination with frustrated passengers who had to wait is not ideal i have flown virgin australia and virgin atlantic and have to say that virgin america lacked the level of customer service i am used to again it was nothing major but the crew looks tired and wanted to get the job done quickly
13823,libyan airlines,4,libyan airlines customer review,manchester tripoli late leaving manchester due out at 1245 and eventually left at around 2pm smallish plane two seats either side of the aisle but hardly anyone on board so plenty of room plane was new and the experience was fine cabin crew were helpful and friendly and food was good no video screens or music so take your own or a book will be using this route again
6798,cemair,7,a very decent experience,a tuesday evening flight it was the cheapest compared to their competitors at such short notice booked the ticket the thursday before if one can get past the aging interior and the 25 year old aircraft an average age for commercial aircraft in sa it was a very decent experience the ground staff was polite and helpful the cabin crew was firm but polite and the onboard service included a complementary packet of crisps a small chocolate and some sweets the complementary beverage service was lovely as the drinks were poured in glass i was entertained by a wine topup upon request im not sure if this is offered on all flights or whether i got lucky because it was the last flight of the day amazing leg room for tall passengers one benefit of flying on a small airplane is the short wait for checkedin baggage on arrival expect a connecting bus to the terminal at larger airports i would probably fly them again in the future should their tickets stay competitive
11020,hong kong airlines,8,a very impressive experience,hong kong airlines seems to be going strong despite of the recent rumours about their financial hardship for this route hx deployed an ex sia a330 plane with old style angle lie flat seat at 222 configuration its from the 90s but still at acceptable condition leg room and seat pitch are acceptable only its a bit cramped when in fully flat position this is ok for short haul flights like this one so no complaints catering and wine selection is average beef is a typically difficult type of meat to serve and get right on board my beef dish was tough so i ate only half despite these short comings what makes hx shine are their well trained cabin crew who are courteous and hard working they are also very proactive and see to my every need throughout the flight reminds me of how things used to be in the long gone past they have a very good on board duty free catalog that offers some unique items fast track was given to help speed through immigration process priority bags are amongst the first to be delivered overall a very impressive experience

20465,thomson airways,6,choose thomson over ryanair and easyjet,corfu to birmingham with thomson airways booked the extra space seats in row 32 which is an exit row giving us plenty of leg room when the flight attendant isnt using the jump seat opposite seat width was a bit narrow but okay for a short haul flight the only issue i had was a strong draft blowing round me which could be felt by the passenger sitting in the aisle seat but not my husband in the window seat no ife provided and drinks were a little on the steep side crew were very chatty and friendly and there were plenty of updates on arrival times and route information from the flight deck during the flight seats were on the thin side and could do with some extra padding but were bearable for a short haul flight toilets were clean and well maintained would choose thomson over airlines such as ryanair and easyjet anytime
13939,loganair,4,never look forward to using this service,over an hour delayed this is consistent with every time i have used this airline very frustrating considering their cost staff at airport didnt seem to care one tried to prevent a customer from using the toilet which was located out with the gate we were sat waiting no facilities provided yes this is bristol airports problem yet she should have been more considerate when i went to advance check in online i was told it would be a 6 charge to select a seat otherwise i would be randomly allocated one even though i was travelling with my partner who was scared of flying overall never look forward to using this service
20877,transavia,2,did nothing to enforce covid regulations,dirty old aircraft extremely uncomfortable despite having an entire row to myself due to the seat design cabin crew friendly enough but did nothing to enforce covid regulations i was seated opposite a customer with her unmasked nose on display and it remained like that for the rest of the flight she wasnt the only one and cabin crew said nothing to anyone they spent most of the flight hiding behind a curtain the aircraft was also disgustingly dirty and had obviously been in this state for some time transavia also refuse to take cash which means you need to have a card they accept to buy any of their low quality overpriced refreshments they also made some weird announcement about people not being able to take pictures or video onboard obviously an attempt to cover up their lack of cleanliness and safety
3053,air transat,1,luggage is sitting in montreal,writing this on sunday night we flew wednesday luggage is sitting in montreal transat knows where it is and still wont send it its starting to feel personal at this point i would try air canada west jet or a euro company before transat as they really dont seem too concerned about our familys trip at all
5656,blue air,3,one of the worst airlines,i think this may be one of the worst airlines i have flown with for some time i initially booked my flight on the basis of the basic fare without luggage and thought that it was fairly reasonable for a no frills flight however i needed to add luggage later on and saw that it was over 65 each way this did not include seat selection or any other benefit so i saw online that you could upgrade your ticket to include luggage seat selection and meals i decided to do this as it seemed that it would offer more comfort and if i was going to pay so much extra for luggage i may as well include the others the meals had to be preordered but i did not get what i ordered you had to pay separately for drinks other than water the waiting time for check in was a disgrace and i was in a queue for approx 90 minutes on my return journey and only passed through security whilst the plane was boarding which meant a rush through the airport to catch my plane this was very stressful and then the premium upgrade i had paid for did not include any priority boarding or any such benefit the flight left on time and landed in good time however it took over 45 minutes until i could pick up my luggage despite a very short queue in passport control the staff were polite but all in all i thought it was a horrible experience which worked out very expensive my flight to cyprus in the end cost more than i have paid for some long haul flights to the usa and se asia at almost 400 with luggage and meals included i would recommend that you check the luggage prices and to steer clear of the food i will not be using this airline again
6668,cathay pacific airways,4,unprofessional and rude service,hong kong to cape town never experienced such unprofessional and rude service about 3 hours before arrival in cape town breakfast was served hostess asked my husband if he wants conpoy congee with beef stroganoff or omelette he replied omelet please she gave him the congee when opened he saw its not the omelet she was then just serving the row behind us he informed her he got the wrong one and asked to switch for the omelette she grabbed the container out of his hand literally threw the omelette infront of him my husband and i were both shocked i wanted to do something about it but my husband asked me to leave it for now we were both very tired after almost 15 hour flight they do not have name tags so i did not get her name
5305,bamboo airways,8,would fly this airline again,ho chi minh city to hanoi the checkin gates are sgn were very crowded but moved efficiently and i was helped in about ten minutes no problem with delayscancellation and the boarding process went smoothly as well we were shuttled from the gate to the tarmac as the airport didnt have enough space for all the planes the flight experience was a bit bumpier than i wouldve liked but we were all given a bottle of water and a small egg salad sandwich which was not bad at all a huge plus for me was that the economy ticket includes a checked baggage if youre traveling across asia its not easy to pack super light i booked my flight three months before the travel date and the price was comparable to vietjet would fly this airline again
22933,xiamen airlines,2,they are a 3rd rate airline,seattle to manila via xiamen my wife and i planned a trip to the philippines from seattle and decided upon xiamen airlines business class the routing was seattle shenzen xiamen and manila we traveled late october 2018 the seating configuration in the boeing 787 business class was 222 the seats were lay flat for sleeping but unfortunately were leatherette covered which meant one would slide forward when seated upright due to the slippery covering lunch was served and i chose duck this was the consistency of rubber and virtually inedible the 125 hour flight was uneventful however during this time the cabin staff barely checked on us when they did there was a distinct language problem we couldnt understand them and they couldnt understand us one would think when one is on a international flight a common understandable language should be used when we arrived at shenzen we had a layover of 2 hours during which time we had to clear chinese customs and immigration after this we had to wait in a departure lounge without being told anything about our next flight leg there were about 12 onward passengers waiting for the next leg eventually we were told our boarding gate and etd the flight to xiamen was around 1 hour after arrival we had to pick up our luggage and we went to the xiamen airlines counter to get a hotel voucher as we had 20 hour layover xiamen airlines to not have a hotel bus or any means to transport us to the hotel we had to change money to get a taxi this was an effort in its own right we did leave some of our baggage at the left luggage office at the airport which helped the next day we caught a taxi back to the airport we go through security on entry to the airport before checking in for our flight to manila i should mention that boarding to manila like the short leg for shenzen was chaos no boarding by class or seating just go for it service on board was almost like a domestic flight again a language problem we arrive in manila after almost 36 hours after leaving seattle it was nice to experience the friendliness of philippine customs and immigration the return from manila to seattle every bit as bad as when we arrived late 1130pm in xiamen we had to clear customs and immigration and by the time that happened it was around 2am banks were closed and we had now money for a taxi to the hotel we finally change 20 with a xiamen airline staff member and got to the hotel around 230 am we were again routed via shenzen and had to go through immigration and carry all bags through security the flight back was slightly better but there was still the language barrier all in all the xiamen airlines experience was poor the airline should make sure the cabin staff have sufficient english to carry out a basic conversation the airline should upgrade all staff to a level of what is expected from a good international airline at the moment they are a 3rd rate airline

17386,s7 siberia airlines,5,leg room and recline was adequate,check in was efficient and fast the business cabin was full there were drinks at the pre takeoff stage flight was a little late boarding and taking off the flight was comfortable and the food service adequate there was no ife on a six hour flight leg room and recline was adequate and given the length of the flight could have been better level of service was only adequate and airline on this experience barely justifies its three star rating s7 siberia airlines recommended only for the value for a direct flight from bangkok to irkutsk
18175,silver airways,1,been a horrible experience,i booked a round trip flight for a friend from san juan to santiago and back for her to attend an event the flight has been cancelled twice the first time they gave me a new date but never sent me the notice i only learned of this because i tried to change the date myself and thank god the event was changed to september so i changed the flight now this second time its been four days since i got notice that the flight has been cancelled again and i still havent got an answer from them regarding a new flight day and also the fact that i am hard of hearing they have never answered my emails except with an automated message and when i tried to reach them through instagram they answered me that i needed to make a phone call i had to ask another friend to make the phone call for me it has been a horrible experience im never using this airline again

22469,volotea,8,very little legroom,good flight no problem luckily the flight was 45 minutes late as our boat between cyclades and athens had delayed its schedule and was 30 minutes late without this delay you would have missed the flight however very little legroom as priority passengers we would have liked to be treated differently from other passengers a seat close to the exits to leave quickly on arrival or a seat at the level of the emergency exits to have more legroom we are very large or the luggage that comes out first please think about it to better consider those who travel frequently with volotea bon vol aucun problme heureusement le vol avait 45 minutes de retard car notre bateau entre les cyclades et athenes avait retard son horaire et avait 30 minutes de retard sans ce retard vous aurions rat le vol par contre trs peu de place pour les jambes en tant que priority nous aurions aim tre trait diffremment des autres passagers un sige proche des sorties pour partir vite larrive ou un sige au niveau des sorties de secours pour avoir plus despace aux jambes nous sommes trs grands ou les bagages qui sortent en premiers merci dy penser pour mieux considrer ceux qui voyagent frquemment avec volotea

123,aegean airlines,1,fee to cancel was 45ticket,we had made a flex p reservation that we had to cancel due to pregnancy the extra fee to cancel was 45ticket this is something we already knew what we didnt know is that the only way to cancel is through their call center but in that case which is actually the only possible case there is an extra call center fee of 20ticket at the same time all the extra services you have purchased even if there is no such clause in the terms conditions we agreed on meaning extra baggage purchased selected seats etc are turned into some kind of owed service valid for a year not a voucher valid for a year the service must have been used not purchased in a year finally for some undetectable reason the refund had to take place not automatically to the card we used to make the reservation but we had to fill out another form one for each ticketpassenger with our bank account details for the reimbursements to take place separately and via bank accounts
14223,luxair,5,luxair customer review,bcnlux with connection luxfra in business class was somewhat concerned that the first leg was with a dash8q400 however the aircraft was clean and well kept meal service consisted of assorted canapes and fresh rolls drinks ranged from wonderful champagne to wines beers and non alcoholic beverages the connection to fra was just as pleasant albeit for a flight of appx 40 minutes on a b737 once again canapes bread and a full beverage service offered this airline is small but amazing

15703,pacific airlines,3,very bad experience,we bought two tickets from hanoi to hoi an with vietnam airlines but it was operated by pacific airlines once on board they had us on the plane for 118 minutes that is about 2 hours very little information about the reason initially they talked about rain although not a single drop fell after 45 minutes without more information we had to talk to them so that they could update our status in all this time not a single drink despite the fact that they are obliged if 2 hours pass we have claimed but they wash their hands they argue that the waiting time was due to technical reasons very different from what we had been told about meteorological reasons they also argue that although time delay was close to 2h for 2 minutes these were not fulfilled and that is why they are not obliged to serve a drink very bad experience not advisable at all

5894,boutique air,2,this airline failed me,i had a departing flight for on 1123 scheduled for 6pm to see my family for thanksgiving just for context this airline has two flights departing from my local airport each day 12pm and 6pm on 1123 my 6pm was cancelled i was assured that the nextdays flight would be highly unlikely to be cancelled so i was rescheduled for the it 1124s 6pm the next day rolls around and i get a text at noon that this flight was also to be cancelled great now i cant see my family for thanksgiving what baffles me is that on each of these days both 12pm flights were not cancelled the airline definitely knew in advanced that my 6pm would fallthrough therefore why was i not offered a seat on a 12pm especially on that second day they had a customer who obviously would have faced a second cancellation in a row yet it didnt cross anyones mind to offer me a seat on the samedays 12pm that was on time they were professional about it but customer service is their only saving grace considering they arent competent enough to work out the logistics of how to reliably route flights i know this because the reason i was told both of my flights were cancelled was because the plane got held up at another airport yeah thats rightnot a serious maintenance weather or issue with the pilot it was because a plane got held up and the pilot didnt have time to fly as if they had another leg after that last 6pm flight for the day this company needs to realize that people are depending on them for their travel plans especially near the holidays in the real world airlines will depart at whatever time necessary to successfully get their passengers from a to b these guys however dont take their companys mission seriously enough to follow through on that task a little hiccup here and there flight cancelled a parent of mine died it was very important that i could be home with my family to spend our first thanksgiving together in memory of her this airline failed me thats no longer going to happen but at least i got a phone call from a customer service rep apologizing and offering a refund this company is simply going to fail because they focus less on how to coordinate flights professionally and instead spend that effort on how to apologize to customers professionally

14893,myanmar airways,7,cabin was nicely decorated,bangkok to yangon with myanmar airways the ticket was quite expensive compared to other airlines on this leg but paid the amount as i wanted to try them out arrived at the airport with literally no line with ground staff asking for details regarding my visa and return flight as i would leave the country via another airline flight was delayed by about 40 minutes upon departure the cabin crew were very friendly and the cabin itself was nicely decorated with some xmas decorations the legroom however was very very poor and definitely less than most lcc carriers on board wifi available to use their app and some content on their app but very limited complimentary drink and snack which was passable for a short flight luggage took a while to be on belt
14628,martinair,4,martinair customer review,the meals were very good and the portions generous the crew were efficient and were on time both ways seating assignments seemed ambiguous but my family of four ended up with one window seat on return to vancouver from amsterdam which was a nice surprise none of my children had any complaint throughout the two long journeys and that would be the measure of a pleasant flight experience by my standards i would fly with martinair again in future
13011,korean air,9,next trip with korean air,seoul to brisbane i would like to comment on the high quality of service during the flight and especially mention one of the cabin crew who was most helpful born professional thank you next trip with korean air
17027,royal brunei airlines,5,didnt handle this well at all,bangkok to melbourne via bandar seri begawan but we never actually flew with royal brunei so i cannot comment on their inflight product i can however review their handling of cancellations delays etc we arrived at bkk airport at 11am for our 130pm flight only to be told that the brunei to melbourne sector was not operating today or the next day for that matter although royal brunei knew this the previous day no email or sms was sent to advise passengers of this we could have stayed at our bangkok hotel and opted for a late checkout if we had known the royal brunei representative told us to take a seat as they were organising an alternative routing for us this dragged on for well over an hour and still they were organising and waiting for confirmations i approached the counter and asked if we could avoid a late night departure if at all possible given the fact that midnight departures and our 7 yearold daughter do not go well together they replied ok we will see just take a seat eventually we were told that we had all been booked on the direct thai airways flight to melbourne departing after midnight there were no other options according to royal brunei thai doesnt operate a morning flight from bkk to mel but if there was a morning flight you could certainly have taken it well of course there is a morning flight with thai tg 461 which operates daily at that stage we had all been booked on tg 465 so we had to go with it we transferred to an airport hotel around 2pm for 7 hours and then back to the airport it is how certain airlines handle unexpected issues such as cancellations delays etc that set them apart from the truly good carriers sadly royal brunei didnt handle this particularly well at all
17074,royal jordanian airlines,1,worst service in our lives,wife and i flew here back in may and just the other day lost luggage 2 pieces x5 days thus time 2x pieces luggage now counting 3rd day cannot say the customer service is awful because when you are rarely able to reach anyone you get the run around no responsibility no professionalism no accountability i could go on about the flights themselves yet would take far too long here been traveling globally for 40 years and we have never seen and had to experience worst service in our lives yet they have the audacity to charge outrageous prices and their idea of excellence is simply getting you there in one piece alive pitiful pathetic incredulous to describe briefly stay away you will be denied access to water on the plane and the food is inedible to say the least didnt even have a boarding pass for our connection out of paris
22766,wizz air,5,plane was very dirty,plane arrived on time and quick debarkation and boarding that had a disadvantage plane was very dirty from the previous flight departed on time and crew was helpful to load luggage to the bins legroom was limited and seat was bearable no recline food you have to buy from a menu
19845,tap portugal,2,not even a glass of water was served,our flight was officially 2 hours and 55 minutes late indeed after 3 hours delay eu regulations would have compelled tp to pay a 200 euros fine to each pax however it was a bit fake as of course boarding was closed at 1455 for a flight supposed to leave at 1200 but the flight itself took off much later by train or bus we would have arrived home before even so not even a glass of water was served fortunately our mileage program status allowed us to wait three hours in tap lounge which is as already mentioned in a previous review overpacked and serving unhealthy food
9194,eva air,9,an excellent experience,amsterdam to bangkok in premium economy an excellent flight the crew were wonderfully friendly the food was plentiful and really fresh and tasty i found the seat to be very comfortable with plenty of leg room if i had any negative comments they would be that announcements need to be clearer and i also thought the meal service was a little rushed overall an excellent experience
18028,silkair,3,silkair is shockingly bad,kuala lumpur to singapore silkair flight departed late due to late arrival of incoming flight when it was time to board a hoard of people rushed to the gate the announcement said business class and gold members first but the hoard was clearly neither staff did not bother to enforce the boarding process and didnt even check the boarding passes of most passengers boarding of silkair is like a bogan fest of people without manners on board the seats are old my seat has basically outworn its upholstery the toilet is tiny and disgusting even upon boarding the toilet smelled like it was full of stale pee in flight the plane was blowing hot air until the plane had enough altitude one drink service of coffee tea or juice overall silkair is shockingly bad i am glad to hear singapore airlines replacing silkair
8011,delta air lines,2,completely off the tracks with its perks,delta has gone completely off the tracks with its perks levels medallions and other bs heres a situation i come in to the sky lounge with a paid 1st class domestic ticket guy scans it several times looks puzzled then asks me whether i have an amex card i give him a platinum delta american express he says oh but this one is only good for when you fly internationally you need to have a different platinum american express or you can pay 50 for a lounge access i ask why i am supposed to present any card at all to access a lounge with a paid first class ticket he comes back with well in order to access a lounge you need a first plus class ticket so this is where i ask delta have you completely lost your mind my response is this would be the last time i paid x4 business fair vs an economy seat for your not so comfortable domestic business class seat how many lounge accesses it takes to cover for one idiot willing to pay for a seat that you are giving away at preboarding do the math
19362,sunwing airlines,2,we were left disappointed,after much contemplation about flying sunwing again because of a less than satisfactory experience last year we decided to give them another chance and booked a trip to panama with them once again we were left disappointed we were enjoying our stay at the resort as such we inquired with sunwing about extending our trip 3 days moving our flight from friday to monday we spoke with the resort and confirmed that we could keep our room and that the cost would be 644 sunwing advised that the total including the room would be 167500 to extend our stay by 3 days our total trip for one week which already included a flight home was 202500 to me this seems as though sunwing was charging for flights all over again even though we were already there and had already paid for a flight back we obviously decided to keep our original departure date and when it was time to chose seats we were unable to upgrade to elite plus as the seats were all blocked out this happened on the way there as well but when we got to the airport there were still elite plus seats available once again we reached out to sunwing and they were unwilling to help and just kept telling us we had to talk to them at the airport and that we needed to book these seats 24 hours in advance but i tried to and was not able to as checkin can only be done 212 hours in advance of the flight by the time we got to the desk at the airport there were no elite plus seats left together only sporadic seats spread throughout the plane since we have arrived home my husband has now noticed that his wallet was stolen from his checked bag and we have contacted sunwing who once again has just said it was not turned in to them and we need to file a report with airport security my advice to you spend the extra couple bucks and fly with another airline
16217,porter airlines,8,one of my best flights,it was my first time flying with porter airline so i was a bit worried especially because the airfare was much less expensive than many other airlines however this was one of my best flights ever and from now on i will use porter airline whenever i can
21509,us airways,1,us airways customer review,returning from cabo san lucas our flight was delayed by almost an hour not usually a problem but we had to catch a connecting flight in phoenix to denver after rushing through the airport we found that we had missed the connecting flight ok no worries we were scheduled on another flight to denver 3 hours later after waiting for almost 3 hours that flight was cancelled no explanations just cancelled the customer disservice person at the us airways counter was rude arrogant and even threatened us with calling the police if we didnt leave the counter we called his bluff and he put down the phone and printed us two boarding passes for yet another flight another 3 hours later this flight was overbooked and we were not even guaranteed a seat by this time i got on my ipad and booked a surprisingly cheap flight on another airline no fuss and we were on our way to denver within the hour it was just a nightmare day from start to finish but by some wild chance of a miracle we did find our luggage when we landed in denver apparently the baggage handlers do know how to do their jobs us airways is unreliable and their people are unprofessional incompetent and downright rude we will never fly this airline again
19672,tam airlines,5,service is more appalling,manaus to recife returning salvador da bahia to manaus it is 2015 and their service is more appalling than ever staff still unable to speak another language than portuguese several foreign travelers seeking information were dismissed by the staff planes are new and cabin recently renovated they no longer serve sandwiches just some toasts with soft drinks sometimes they dont serve anything even on flights longer than 2 hours they are now cheaper than their competitors most of the time i was surprised that all flights left on time thats something rare for tam will fly them again but only if i dont have a choice
11326,icelandair,1,more time in the airports than in new york,our flight got delayed from new york to iceland from 7pm until way later when we arrived at iceland they swapped our flight to hi fly i think and they were so kind but we waited 2 hours until the flight actually departed but thats icelandairs fault we arrived at london heathrow and we waited for our luggage from 830pm to 1000pm and it turns out they left our luggage in iceland thankfully everyone in the other airports were very nice saying theyll reimburse us giving us a free hotel for the night as we have a disabled person with us and also giving us meal vouchers they told us we wont get our luggage until christmas eve meaning we wont get to relax on christmas eve and well be having to unpack another woman on the flight she was only meant to be in iceland for the weekend and there were no flights until today the staff in iceland just left them without any information of any flights they can take and thankfully they got the flight that departed today whatever you do dont fly icelandair some of the staff are rude theyre disorganised and dont care about anyone and are just plainly selfish i wanted to have a nice holiday in new york but when i look back at the holiday which i just had all i see is the stress they put us through and not the memories we had in new york we spent more time in the airports than we did in new york
19896,tap portugal,4,should kick out tap from the alliance,its a 125 h flight and tap only provides two meals there is no snack available even for purchase they provide lunch right after the takeoff around noonish lisbon time after that there is no food for 9 hours the food option is also mostly carb in economy class the real problem was after landing in sfo it took a while to get to the get after landing not taps fault after immigration people gathered around baggage claim after 10 minutes bags started to show up wait only 10 bags came and they all belonged to the crew we waited another 15 minutes no sign of any other bags we asked the tap stewards and stewardess who were also waiting but nothing came out another 20 minutes passed we asked cbp united customer service called tap phone number no solution no one knows the stewards went to their hotels and we were thinking of doing the same but there was no guarantee that tap would deliver them to your home finally the bags came after 1h 15 min no tap reps were visible during this entire time they never picked up their phone united rep announced on pa system several time to tap reps come and talk to the passengers without any result overall a horrible experience star alliance should kick out tap from the alliance

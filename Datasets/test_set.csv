13365,lan airlines,7,lan airlines customer review,sydneysantiago and back from buenos aires via santiago overall very pleasant flights particularly due to the friendly efficiency of the crews good food and drink and efficient service on the transpacific routes the a340 has two business class cabins the rear one rows 6 and 7 is very cold and apparently the temperature cannot be adjusted so avoid these rows if you can they are obviously aware of this problem because on both journeys the crew moved all passengers including us out of rows 6 and 7 into the forward cabin rows 1 to 5 where we were much more comfortable however we were in rows 6 and 7 for the short legs from sydney to auckland and vice versa where we had to use blankets over our shoulders to keep warm we greatly enjoyed our flight in the lan dreamliner from buenos aires to santiago its a much more comfortable plane than the a340 the lounge in santiago is quite basic its narrow and in a basement but offers some chance to relax the lounges in buenos aires and auckland qantas lounge are far superior,9.0,8,8,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

16593,qatar airways,7,left me in a less than good mood,i love qrs q suites this was the second sector of a flight from the uk as usual service and in flight offerings were excellent apart from one thing generally i have never worked out why qr pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand in this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours that cuts sleep time specifically this is the second time i have had qr flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time and then get it hopelessly wrong this time i wished merely coffee juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible i was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing i stated one hour when i was wakened i discovered it was two hours prior to landing i then waited about 20 minutes before another fa tried to set up my table for a full breakfast asking her to look at the request sheet there was no apology eventually i got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant asking for a second croissant yet another full bread basket arrived only later when i had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear when so much else is so good this is surely a major error on an overnight flight it certainly left me in a less than good mood,5.0,7,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

6081,british airways,4,do not think the fare was worth the money,paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over 300 for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal 5 which was very crowded being 630 in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b36 and waited there for 40 mins boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2a and 2c seat 2b was blocked out which acted as an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi was flaky at best and nonexistent at other times i was glad it was only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money,4.0,5,4,5.0,6.0,8.0,6.0

4458,anadolujet,1,this was my worst flight ever,my departure time was on 2315 from saw airport i went to the checkin counter at around 2030 as the counter was assigned to literally all of the anadolujet flights i had to wait in the line for more than an hour and a half when i finally reached the counter i noticed that the staff cannot speak english effectively in fact they pronounced kg as kee zhee on top of that great experience so far there still was a surprise awaiting me right at the counter i realized that the baggage allowance for this flight is 20 kg not 25 kg and not 30 kg that of course was my own fault my baggage was 7 kg overweight and i was willing to pay for that extra weight you may not believe it but that simple process took almost an hour because it was so hard for them to accept usd instead of ytl or euros finally after a long wait in the final passport control gate i ran from there to the flight gate and reached there at around 2305 but it was not the end of that terrible experience when i got onboard i realized that the passengers are arranged as if there has never been a covid 19 pandemic everyone was sitting in the closest possible distance from the next person and meanwhile there was no passenger in almost 15 of the plane in addition to that when i found my seat i noticed that there is no room for my hand bag in the compartment above my head when i asked the flight attendant for help he again with the most possibly basic english responded that he cannot do anything because he does not know whose belongings are occupying the compartment finally i should add that i am from iran and my country is not known for its high quality airlines but even so this was my worst flight ever,1.0,1,1,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0
3756,akasa air,3,expensive seat cost,when the crew assistance button is pushed the crew came to my seat almost 34 minutes later there were children sitting in emergency exit bays both in row 15 and in 16 though they were made to sit in some other seat while take off and landing the crew seems to be more interested in making money than to assist unreasonably expensive seat cost i had to pay 20000 inr as it was urgent while doing web check in there was no option to auto seat select and was forced to book exit bay seats with paying additional 1400 inr and this felt like a scam why because there were passengers at last moment that were sitting in some other seats and were allowed to sit in the seats for which i paid extra also at last moment some passengers were asked to sit in the seats that i paid extra for and it doesnt seems like thats their seat as no seat number verification was done,2.0,6,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

16279,porter airlines,1,will never use this airline again,since i never received a boarding pass due to no one being at the counter to fly back to montreal it can not be a verified review unless i use the one on 8 november 2019 which had the same issues except i didnt miss my flight you see porter airlines on has someone at the counter for 1 hr prior to the flight and that is the only way you can receive your boarding pass which is a ridiculous practice and i can not imagine that this policy serves them well on november 10 2019 i arrived at dulles airport 55 minutes prior to my departure time due to a traffic incident i go to the counter to find it empty and no one to give me a boarding pass i called their customer service no to be received by a very rude person stating that i should have been there one hour ahead of my flight which i would have if not stuck on the 95 in washington dc i was 5 minutes short you can not use a kiosk to get your boarding pass and you can not get a mobile boarding pass i had to buy another flight on another airline in a different airport to get back home in montreal i was 2 hrs early for my flight and again no one was at the counter and even though i was early i had to stand there waiting for someone to come to work at porter to get a boarding pass so instead of getting through security and customs a bit early i was rushed and running to my gate i will never use this airline again,2.0,2,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

21566,uzbekistan airways,8,recommend uzbekistan airways,moscow to tashkent fast and efficient check in at the domodedovo airport with a ample lounge to relax before boarding with great drinks and food choices boarding process was a bit chaotic the plane was full and there was no separate line for business class so it took a while for agents to check documents and boarding passes of everyone in the long queues until i was allowed to board 3 friendly flight attendants greeted me aboard the beautiful cabin of their new boeing 787 took me to my assigned seat hung my jacket and offered me some champagne with a refill shortly after they spoke very good english and were genuine friendly and courteous they distributed noisecanceling headphones newspapers and magazines a cool amenities kit a nice touch since this was a 5hours flight and the landing forms plus informed lunch would be served shortly after takeoff cabin was very nice with ambient lighting and logos and touches of uzbekistan airways seat was very comfortable but not as private as if it was on a 222 configuration since i had an empty seat next to me i had all the privacy plus lots of additional space right after takeoff a flight attendant came to offer hot towels additional drinks with a few small plates and a food feast began several courses were served and i was very impressed by the quantity and quality of the food presented even though they did not offer a printed menu stewardess brought several choices of appetizers salads soups main courses and encouraged me to try different combinations also the desserts i agreed with two choices but they brought more and everything was high quality and well prepared and presented in porcelain with uzbekistan colors and logos very classy shortly after lunch they offered a tablet with several movies and music programs to choose from flight attendants keept checking passengers by offering more drinks blankets etc until captain has announced the approach to tashkent after landing they went to every passenger to thank them for flying with uzbekistan and to welcome to their country as the airplane parked at a remote stand a bus assigned to business class passengers took us to a private arrival lounge where private immigration and customs facilities were offered and the whole process went quite fast i was very impressed with the warm and professional service provided along with excellence and attention to details only aspect to be improved would be the boarding process for premium classes i recommend uzbekistan airways and i am willing to fly with them again,9.0,9,9,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0

16205,pobeda airlines,9,exceeded expectations,stansted to st petersburg overall very fluid experience definitely exceeded expectations being someone who lives in the uk who flies regularly to europe for weekend breaks im no stranger to low cost carriers by the likes of ryanair and easyjet this week i decided to try out pobedas new route from london to st petersburg and i was genuinely surprised by its efficiency and overall value flying direct to russia in the past usually meant going on aeroflot or british airways both which offer pretty average service and almost always cost upwards of 150 return for 50 return on most days pobeda makes flying on this route much more attractive for tourists like me a bit of a hack but if youre booking directly from their website always search in rubles instead of poundseurosdollar as not sure why but the difference in price is quite significant even including all the exchange fees your bank might charge anyways since i was flying from outside russia much like other low cost carriers online check in was a must if you wanted to avoid paying extra this took less than a few minutes after which i loaded my boarding pass onto my phone at the airport having no checked bags i walked straight to the security checks and 10 minutes later i was at the gate waiting to board while boarding a noticed several passengers repacking their stuff so they are definitely strict with their bag policy in short you are only allowed to bring one handbag or backpack with you on board anything larger than the dimensions described when booking such as suitcases camping bags or duffel bags must be checked in this is a tad less but not too different from other low cost carriers as of november 2018 checked baggage is priced reasonably if prebooked 9 each bag each way for 10kg and 11 for 20kg because of the restrictive bag policy boarding was insanely fast as passengers no longer had to fight for overhead space on board the legroom was decent better than some low cost carriers such as wizz air but for sure no worse than most and much like the rest it did not recline which was fine as i was flying during the day the plane was also brand new and the cabin was very clean food was however unavailable on board which was a little disappointing though you are welcome to bring your own food and water is served for free by the time we landed in st petersburg to my surprise we were half an hour ahead of schedule and it didnt take much longer before we were past immigration and outside the airport one of the best flights ive had with a low cost carrier quick and efficient and didnt encounter any problems at all as with all low cost carriers as long as you pay attention to the bag policy and remember to check in online when flying from outside russia you shouldnt have any issues very good value for the amount you pay,9.0,9,8,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0

12950,korean air,7,crew were efficient and friendly,i was in prestige class on the boeing 777 ke has the latest cabin product the apex suites installed in their b777300er aircraft the cabin configuration is 222 but every seat has aisle access those seated at the window can access the aisle via a narrow passage so that he doesnt need to disturb the aisle seat passenger as it was a red eye flight the meal service was breakfast i choose the korean style breakfast of congee with condiments the seat was wide and comfortable and fully reclining there was a privacy divider between seats which you can use if your neighbour is a stranger the cabin crew were efficient and friendly at the end of the flight the cabin manager came around to ask each prestige class passenger whether he enjoyed the flight i have to point out some lapses in service which i hope that ke can address before landing cabin crew did not go around to ensure that passengers lifted up the window shades there was no way for nonkorean citizens to preorder and pay for dutyfree items for collection on board i had to contact sky shop via kakao messenger to place the order and make payment on board i believe that this is something that ke should seriously look into as ke is an international company there was no welcome pa from the flight deck and no announcement on the flight plan and route unlike other airlines it was only after landing at icn that a cabin crew made an announcement i believe that passengers want to hear from the flight deck,9.0,8,8,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0
20873,transavia,3,this shows their lack of professionalism,on the day 12th of january 2022 we had a flight from amsterdam to reykjavik at 1645 flight hv 6887 this flight was canceled due the weather conditions in iceland in order to enter iceland we had to do an antigen test prior 72h the entry to the country our country of origin was spain where we paid 40 for two antigen tests then we spent two days in amsterdam and everything was planned in order to have the test still valid to travel to iceland obviously we never took into consideration that our flight was going to be canceled and since that happened we asked to a lady at transavias counter if we had to repeat the test and her answer was no your test will still be valid the next day when we managed to get to schiphol airport we went again to ask at the transavias counter to make sure if we had to do the test and this time the answer was yes otherwise you might not be able to enter in iceland so we repeated the test which cost us 116 i emailed them that the fact that we had to repeat the test wasnt our fault and if there was any chance to get a refund and i didnt get an answer in more than two months the first email i sent was on the 13th of january then again on the 21st of january no answer from them and again out the 15th of march when ive been told that they couldnt do anything because the flight was canceled due the weather conditions what upsets me the most is the fact that two of their operators gave me two different answers ive never got any apologies from them about this whole situation and they took more than two months to give me an answer the final answer ive got was after five days that ive sent them the second reminder they dont seem to care much about their customers and it seems that theyre not really trained to deal with a situation like the one i had this shows their lack of professionalism and its the reason why i will never travel with them again,2.0,4,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

5093,azerbaijan airlines,6,a little lacklustre,i had high expectations of azerbaijan airlines after reading reviews on the internet unfortunately the overall experience was a little lackluster the ife did not work and the crew seemed to be moody and unwilling to do anything when it came to food although hot it did not taste very nice at all i also put a wake me up sticker on my seat which involved a member of the crew shoving my bag a few times in order to wake me up then quite literally be rude and ask chicken or beef limited food choice towards the rear of the aircraft all the arm rest seats were broken this was annoying as the flight was not full and being a solo passenger i had a row to myself which i could not use the return leg was marginally better a full flight due to a cancellation the previous delay the ife was awfully outdated and very slow to load i did manage to watch something which was good the crew here were more attentive and actually seemed to enjoy bring on the flight i would only recommend this airline if you prefer to flight direct to azerbaijan,4.0,6,6,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

20941,tui airways,2,worst check in experience ever,one of the worst check in experience ever in theory you can get the boarding pass online but i tried on this flight and in a couple of other flights to get it with the app and from the website always failed call the number and the operator is very nice and tries hard to appease you telling you they will look into it and try later but it simply does not work so to get the boarding pass you need to go to the airport checkin where inevitably you find a single very long line rolling out to the outside of the airport entrance of the departure hall the line is not even sorted by destinations or by departure times many tui staff in uniform hanging around to assist you but no real help is provided despite operating in an italian airport the staff does not speak italian but only english appalling service i will certainly try to avoid this company in the future,1.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

16638,qazaq air,9,excellent and amazing value,qazaq air from almaty to shymkent returning a few days later very good value considering tickets were booked less than 48 hours before departure nice new aircraft and smartly attired crew who were all trilingual baggage is included in the ticket price and hand luggage was not strictly monitored but since both flights were not full there was plenty of space in the overhead lockers check in at both ends was perfunctory and more or less wordless but the flights were punctual the return flight leaving 25 minutes before the scheduled time of 0110 which was greatly appreciated by all on board there was even a snack service with a good choice of drinks all included in the ticket price another retro touch was the basket of sweets offered round before take off i would definitely fly this airline again and hope they expand their destinations the only thing i would say against them is that at present their small fleet seems to mean that certain routes are served with en route stops that added to the slower speed of the q400 aircraft could make some trips around kazakhstan quite arduous overall though excellent and amazing value,9.0,9,9,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0
20564,tigerair,9,flight itself was good,singapore to kuala lumpur the cabin crew lacked service skills onboard and not understandable english announcement pronunciation but otherwise the flight itself was good barely a short 34 mins flight time was able to enjoy the comfortable journey when the back row of the seat pitch is more generous then the front one however the schedule is not so convenient and the payment service charge is slightly higher omong others there are a western and female cockpit crew together with cabin crew greeted us with feeling when we all disembarked nice touch,8.0,8,8,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0

10126,frontier airlines,1,simply cannot be trusted,i recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with frontier airlines and let me tell you it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish the pinnacle of their incompetence came in the form of a tardy email attempting to apologize for their abysmal service frontier airlines late apology email is merely a feeble attempt to pacify disgruntled customers who have suffered through their abysmal service their claim to strive for the best travel experience possible is nothing short of a hollow marketing slogan if you value your time money and sanity i strongly recommend avoiding frontier airlines at all costs and strongly advise against choosing frontier airlines their empty promises lengthy refund timelines and overall incompetence make them an airline that simply cannot be trusted,1.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

20104,thai airways,7,i did expect better,this was my first time flying since covid and i was a little disappointed the aircraft was only just over 6 years old and wasnt in the best kept condition economy was quite empty on this flight you could see that the airline had spread passengers about which was great as you have to do a pcr test upon arrival food was lovely i must admit if you wanted anything outside of service it was a long wait although staff were pleasant no wifi which i was surprised at dont get me wrong its not the bee all and end all the convenience on a direct flight is always a key factor when flying but i did expect better it wasnt horrific but just wasnt what ive come to expect from thai airways,7.0,6,7,6.0,6.0,8.0,7.0

3776,akasa air,1,i loved their services,akasa is fairly new to the indian aviation however i loved their services from ground staff to the onboard cabin crew akasa being an lcc has the best fares including their flexi fares which i found the best thing about flying with them comparison to other low cost airlines i had pre booked a meal which was a special holi festive meal it tasted good and was fresh a choice of complimentary beverage was also included in the fare which was nice also another great thing was the free water bottle which is nothing but a dream onboard many other lccs like air asia where they charge even for a bottle of water so i do appreciate akasa air for this also the boeing 737 max 8 aircraft was very comfortable with wider windows and great interior mood lighting overall a great flight which despite taking off late arrived before time and i would love to fly akasa again,9.0,9,9,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0

18633,south african airways,4,south africans take the cake,i expected the egyptian check in people to be difficult but boy was i wrong the south africans take the cake i flew from cairo with a transit in jhb before arriving in cpt my bags were easily admitted in cairo as they were 26kg and 12kg respectively the sum of both was 8 kilos less than the permitted 46 kilos of weight that saa allows yet in jhb the checkin enforcer insisted that i must transfer 3 kilos from the heavier bag to the lighter one even with a 32kg max allowance sign hanging right behind him i tried to persuade him to let this one go he was immovable this repacking i had to do with a long queue behind me in full view of everyone in sight going through my underwear and carefully wrappedpacked items that were now dishevelled in order to placate the gods of south african airways and their arbitrary baggage rules on weight distribution both bags end up on the same plane this kind of unyielding strictness is incredibly unreasonable and poor for maintaining any loyalty you might want to foster in your customers i know business class gets 32kg x2 for every customer so please dont tell me this was to save the employees backs from needing a chiropractor by the time i was finally checked in i was hot sweaty and very angry with saa the noose gets tighter every year with your restrictions saying yes to me would pose no threat to the airplane or to your profits please consider reasonable allowances for your customers,8.0,6,5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
6846,china airlines,6,no announcement on the aircraft,bangkok to taipei i fail to understand why this flight and the return leg arrived at and departed from terminal 2 the ticket specifies terminal 1 immigration and baggage delivery are at terminal 1 and the return checkin is at terminal 1 this is not the first time this has happened on a ci flight so why does ci not have proper facilities in terminal 2 or mark the ticket information as terminal 2 as far as i am aware on arrival at tpe there was no announcement on the aircraft and no printed announcement on the video monitors passengers were therefore left with a weakly written and seemingly unimportant sign on exiting the gate ramp but a china airlines attendant stood right in front and in the middle of that sign rendering it impossible to read and her main job seemed to be to direct passengers en route to a soon departing fukuoka flight since the bangkok flight had arrived late the only sign exiting passengers can easily see is the bright illuminated sign above stating that for immigration passengers should turn right that though is for terminal 2 immigration and baggage claim the handwritten sign that should be in very large thick clear lettering easily visible to all disembarking passengers pointed out that those going to terminal 1 should actually turn left and then walk a very long way a staff member giving instructions in chinese is of little use to those not conversant in the language having been caught out by this once before and wasted almost an hour after this flight i stopped and took time to check the sign carefully this unthoughtthrough action apart the flight was smooth and the meal very tasty my only other gripe about china airlines is the headphones for the ife it makes available the ancient circular ones i accept these fit nicely into the ears of a majority of passengers but not all ears are the same and they just dont fit mine at all so even though this with a weather delay was only a 4hour flight watching anything on the ife was out of the question,3.0,7,7,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0

3065,air transat,3,plane left over 50 minutes late,very unhappy with air transat and their lack of professionalism plane left over 50 minutes late due to waiting on one of the pilots arrival we boarded 40 minutes late than sat on the tarmac waiting for another 45 minutes asked one of the cabin attendants why the delay and he just shrugged his shoulders and brushed me off no apology or reason i understand that there are delays and issues from time to time but this is not acceptable,2.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

7001,china eastern airlines,8,at the price really is a steal,los angeles to hong kong via shanghai for the price this cant be beaten i paid lass than 1900 for round trip business class seat thought the experience was great for the price im sure some would find the food a little underwhelming word of advicego for the asian meal there could have been more entertainment not sure how many movies they had but it wasnt extensive by any means the seats werent the most comfortable but they werent the worst either my main goal was to sleep most of the way and that was achieved easily im sure some folks would think this is poor for business class but look at the price that really is a steal so my expectations werent too high and they overdelivered cabin crew were reasonably friendly and although english is a 2nd language on board again it wasnt a huge problem if i can get seats at that price again id certainly do it,9.0,9,8,6.0,6.0,8.0,6.0
3440,airasia x,6,not comfortable to say the least,tokyo haneda to kuala lumpur with airasia x flight departed and landed on time did not prebook a seat and was allocated a middle seat which was not comfortable to say the least cabin crew were a little slow in starting meal service and hence i had to wait some time before i could purchase a drink was an overnight flight so largely napped for most of the time,4.0,5,7,5.0,6.0,4.0,4.0

23149,zipair,2,airline is a total ripoff for the extras,this airline is a total ripoff for the extras first airline that i have ever travelled with a restriction on the number of bags that can be attributed to a passenger for checkin so that meant that even if i didnt hit the limit of 32kg extra baggage that i purchased out of my own pocket using 1 bag the other bags cannot be checked in judging from the number of people who were also stuck at the checkin line i know that this requirement is not clearly made known to passengers had to purchase for seat assignments that itself was understandable since this is a budget airline but the seat was not clearly indicated to be non reclining imagine 6hrs of sitting upright someone ought to be compassionate enough to indicate this to passengers just like what other airlines does,4.0,2,5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
20007,thai airways,1,boarding staff were very rude,i do believe that thai airways is known to provide smooth journey experience but to my surprise during my recent travel with your airlines i found that there was no priority boarding services offered and it was really difficult to stand in the long queue with my 5 months old infant who was crying inconsolably above all the boarding staff were very rude when asked for the guidance i wonder the way the staff yelled to go and stand in the line as if they are offering any free services i really felt humiliated by the way i got treated i wish the airlines will teach your staff to treat the passengers politely and with the deserved respect in addition that how can the cabin crew forgot to provide life jacket for the infant in case of any emergency landing thankfully nothing kind of that happened hope your airlines provide smooth journey experience next time looking forward for positive changes,2.0,5,6,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

15354,olympic air,5,flight itself was fine,rhodes to athens with olympic air the flight itself was fine the a320 was clean with those typical hardcushioned thinner type seats albeit with good legroom you also get a free sugar kick via a paper cup of coke a cookie and a candy in a swift nondentistfriendly service which is not much yet already 3x more than what you get on an lcc engaged fas with a certain flair also add to the appeal the problem was that the flight was delayed for over an hour yet no one considered it a good idea to inform people already queing up at the gate it was only 5 mins after the original departure time still on the gate screen that a ground handling lady showed up to inform passengers that the plane hadnt taken off yet from athens so she couldnt really say when we would fly why on earth would a3 just let people go airside at what is easily one of the busiest airports per square ft just to try to find a spot to seat for hours with no info and even if the airport staff at rhodes is overwhelmed why dont you use the app to inform passengers as i type this i see that the sunday flight was also an hour and 15 mins late is that a pattern bottom line if you are booking your flights independently allow plenty of slack for your connecting flights as high season ramps up,8.0,7,6,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0
11350,icelandair,5,the aircraft is pretty nice,as someone who has never flown transatlantic with icelandair before it would be pretty interesting i would say the aircraft is pretty nice i would say charging 4 for headphones as well as having credit card computers not working was very disappointing it was delayed at keflavik because you were likely to come up at a remote stand and the bus would have to wait for the last passengers to come,4.0,6,6,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0
18730,south african airways,8,revive belief in the joy of flying,durban to johannesburg south african airways aircraft might be a bit older but they are clean and comfortable ground staff seem knowledgeable and friendly while flight crew are courteous and quite personable food is a bit amateurish but what do you expect from short domestic flights for someone like me who correlates domestic flying to a form of torture due to years of flying with airlines in the us saa will revive your belief in the joy of flying regardless if they are domestic or international flights,9.0,8,8,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

21342,united airlines,3,customer experience is not important,i think it would be a very beneficial eye opening experience for scott kirby to fly as a regular customer during bad weather conditions spend time in a long line for the travel assistance for rebooking the flight and then trying to figure out where to spend a night or few nights before the next flight i was coming from a wonderful european vacation on july 9th as soon as i arrived to the newark airport i received a very unwelcome message that my connecting flight was canceled the next 4 hours were extremely frustrating the united app was not working long line to the travel assistance full of frustrated customers elderly people and parents with young crying children kept growing a travel agent informed me that a seat for me is available no earlier than july 12th i registered for the standby for the earliest flight the next day as well i as every other person in that line needed to find a place to spend a night possibly 3 nights the agent was kind enough to give me 3 vouchers 15 each i am a full time employee and have responsibilities so i had to inform my manager about my encounter the next day i spent camping out at the newark airport on a standby list the overbooking practices help maximize the profits and brings hefty bonuses to the top management of the airline at the expense of their customers in europe airlines are penalized with high fines for overbooking the airline should be able to develop a backup plans for bad weather and not use it bad weather as an excuse for inconvenience keeping travelers stranded for days passing down the operating cost to customers seems like customer experience is not important for united airlines,2.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

13649,level,3,its still as expensive as any other airline,its supposed to be a low cost company so thats why they dont offer food on long flights 12h but its still as expensive as any other airline also probably its a company policy but at some point the cabin crew shuts the windows even if theres light outside and its daytime in the destination of origin where everyone is used to the time already so they basically decide when you should sleep or not 30 minutes before landing they offer a drink or a breakfast so you dont even have the time to eat properly basically it has the worst from a low cost company but the price of a regular airline,3.0,4,4,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0

6666,cathay pacific airways,5,fas never welcomed us properly,my family has been flying cathay for a long time on trans continental and other long haul flights having flown ana jal and other asian airlines we decided to give cathays business class product a try as we had heard good things about them our first impression from the onset was lack of hospitality from the check in counters which gradually got worse as we boarded the onboard fas never welcomed us properly didnt ask for our coats to be hung the flight manager came once introducing herself and we never saw her again the crew were just pacing up and down the aisle and never once smiled they continued with one of the worst meal offerings the meals on a set menu werent dine anytime options they were pre packaged and felt the same offerings were being presented to economy class passengers the bread tasted like it was transported from 4 flights before it wasnt surprising to see how much cathay had declined in the reviews currently they sit at the bottom among 10 best airlines in some websites and much lower in others its sad to see that a premier airlines cant get the basics right perhaps the can take a leaf from ana and singapore airlines hospitality we flew singapore economy on short haul flights and their service was next to superb with so much attention to details in economy the positives at cathay were their beds and on board ife the beds were very comfy with the duvets and offered good privacy however the cabin cleanliness wasnt great the 777 aircraft was tired looking the pier lounge at hkg was great at first impression especially their tea and bar offerings however the lounge fell completely flat in food options ana and jal lounges in japan are absolutely amazing compared to cathays i still believe in the airlines but i wont be flying unless i have experienced from other travellers that they have indeed improved their lacklustre service and food offerings,4.0,5,3,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0
4712,aurigny air,3,continue to gouge the customer,gatwick to guernsey on an atr 72 this is a small plane very small so small in fact i banged my head upon entering the cabin im 6ft tall and couldnt stand upright seating was okish the seat was comfortable enough but legroom was very restricted cabin crew were friendly enough and the flight was fairly short around 45 minutes guernsey to gatwick on an embraer 195 this is a bigger aircraft legroom was a little better but the seat was considerably more uncomfortable cabin crew were a little surly and again the flight was short 30 mins and uneventful aurigny i believe are the only airline that flies to guernsey from the uk so having a monopoly they arent too concerned with customer service ba to my surprise gave complimentary hot drinks and a breakfast bar on their belfast city heathrow route aurigny charge 250 for a small cup of basic teacoffee and if you want a breakfast bar or muffin with that the price rises to 350 now consider that my ba ticket cost less than aurigny if another airline starts flying to guernsey then they might start giving out complimentary hot drinks until then they will continue to gouge the customer,3.0,6,5,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0

2931,air tahiti nui,5,air tahiti nui customer review,we flew on april 7 and 14 back and forth to papeete while the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights a standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways they dont really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous they didnt weigh or even notice our backpacks the tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seatsfloor were stained throughout the cabin i brought clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so the amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature the food was not very good at all cold and soggy the best bet is to bring something such as a powerbar if you are a picky eater the movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you dont have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest the flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an overextended period of time my suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable row 43 a row of 4 in the back has in seat tray tables so you cant lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on seat guru the airport in papeete is under construction and it took over 25 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to moorea in conclusion if flying to tahiti again i would try to find a different airline when booking but would likely fly this one again if i had too as the destination is paradise,6.0,7,6,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0

13500,latam airlines,2,my worst airline experience,we flew latam but on delta so the trip itself was not a problem the real problem is if you need to make any changes to your ticket you are really doomed let me explain why i had to change the tickets dates for me my kids and my mother in march 2023 every time i called it was a different problem every single time they encountered a problem in the system every time i called same day the fare would have a different price it would vary from 2k to 3k and then 700 on the same day this is only the fare difference on the ticket i have already purchased i know the fare changes constantly but it didnt make sense every representative would give me a insane price every time i called the changing fee would be different on every call on one call he said there would be no fee another one told me it would be 150 and then 300 and 450 no consistency even when i agreed to pay a lot more for the fare difference the system would not process the payment and i would have to call back later and go through the same process over and over again also my mother was on a different reservation so i had to double the calls because they could not resolve everything in a single call always saying the system was down or payment could not be processed at that time after several calls the problem was resolved at 2am dont get me wrong the customer service representatives are polite and friendly but they cannot help fast forward to june i had to change my mothers reservation again when i booked her ticket several months ago i bought a more expensive ticket so we could have flexibility on changes and it was the same nonsense several calls crazy fare changes and to put the ticket on hold they wanted to charge me 450 changing fees the fare difference whenever i book in the future so it was better just not show up for this flight and buy a new ticket with another airline company i dont usually write reviews but i wasted so much time and money that latam was my worst airline experience,2.0,2,2,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

1782,air india,3,disappointed to the core,had one of the worst experiences being a frequent flyer our flight from bangkok arrived 20 minutes prior to the expected time collected our baggage went through customs and other formalities just to reach the domestic air india counter to find out that our flight was delayed departure by 2 hours and the airport staff went let us go to the departure gates area as our boarding procedure was pushed coz of the delay too me along with my wife and 2 kids had to unwillingly wait at the international exit where none of the few charging sockets were working and the sitting are was so crowded that restless passengers had to sleep on the floors im sure many others would agree to seeing this happen spent 3 hours sitting on the seats with eyes full of sleep and tiredness i assume that airlines are treating passengers according to their places of arrival and dominate passengers coz of the routes being less favorite by delaying flights unnecessary etc im shocked how a key player like air india act so unprofessionally after being in business for a very long time disappointed to the core,3.0,2,3,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
12438,jetstar asia,6,acceptable and reasonably priced,bangkok to singapore with jetstar asia from past experience i find budget carriers in asia to be aerial buses you get what you pay for and not much else the flight was just that it left on time and we arrived the plane was an old airbus that had seen better days and was in a fairly run down condition the back of seats were showing all the signs of a well used plane and the one in front of me would not return to the correct upright position meaning my already tight seating position was made worse these airlines planes are configured to fit the maximum number of asian travellers and as such make them tight for bigger aussies generally the staff were concerned with getting everyone on and off as quickly as possible however the flight was not bad just tight and endurable for its 2 hour length that however would be the limit i dont believe i would want to be in those seats for longer for a shortish hop around asia it was acceptable and reasonably priced i would use them again but not for longer than two hours,7.0,7,6,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

21419,ural airlines,6,average level of service,sochi to moscowdomodedovo to be honest was a bit worried about flying ural airlines when i looked at the flight statistics for the past 30 days they had more than 1000 flight cancellations far above any other airline in europe and over 2000 delays as expected the flight boarded late and we departed 20 minutes behind schedule the plane was full unlike other airlines they limit carryon baggage to 5 kg instead of 10 kg but i dont know if this is strictly enforced my bag was just over 10 kg so i checked it that said it seemed that the incabin overhead storage was less full then typical so maybe this restriction has a positive effect by reducing incabin baggage and by doing so it quickens boarding time the plane was a not new but did not have signs of excessive wear the seat was cramped and my knees we pushing into the back of the passenger in front of me especially when he decided to recline not very pleasant the meal served was a bland chicken sandwich with mayonnaise cheese lettuce and the standard slices of cucumber that one typically gets on all russian airlines the flight attendants were polite and businesslike after arriving at moscowdomodedovo the wait at baggage claim seemed long with a big time gap between the first wave of bags and the second of course i had to wait for the second in summary it was an uneventful flight with the average level of service that one would expect for a midsize air carrier,7.0,7,6,6.0,6.0,6.0,5.0

10406,germanwings,5,germanwings customer review,hamburg to prague late monday morning this segment was part of a larger lufthansa itinerary though clearly advertised as a 4u flight the catch here is that germanwings out of hamburg is actually operated by eurowings crj900s which is an absolute letdown compared to the usual a320s the staff are enthusiastic about offering refreshments though unlike lufthansa proper these are strictly for sale and are perhaps pushed too hard there was nothing intrinsically wrong with the flight expect for the tight and cramped airplane these flights just dont measure up to the level of service across the lh network,7.0,6,7,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0

5710,blue islands,3,had to drop to flybe standards,southampton to guernsey really disappointing now that they are incorporated to flybe previously flew this route often with blue islands always good service and on time now impossible to book with free baggage prices increased less staff at southampton and bundled in with other rest of flybe flights so long check in queues i understand that airlines need to adapt and move with the times but why blue islands have had to drop to flybe standards i dont know onboard service ok but expensive poor selection food and drink would rather have the old lounges and tiny planes back would recommend flying aurigny from london or bristol instead,5.0,5,6,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0

4538,arkefly,8,arkefly customer review,flew amsterdam aruba amsterdam or363 and or 364 in july 2014 the outbound flight was on one of the old 767300s a noticeably old and used aircraft approx 25 yo the seats in economy provide just enough legroom and you indeed have to pay for everything since the flight was only around 50 cheaper than the klm alternative i would not recommend this one especially due to the old and noisy aircraft the charter flight customers many crying children and relatively inattentive crew however the return flight was a brand new 787 dreamliner aircraft in which i chose to fly star class the difference is huge the aircraft is quiet spacious and the seats and service in star class are much like business class with other premium airlines you pay 270 for an upgrade which is decent value for money all in all i would only fly arkefly long distance again if it would be in the 787,8.0,8,8,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0
17628,saudi arabian airlines,1,it couldnt care less,do not fly with this airline my experience with saudia was not only the worst that ive had with any airline but also the worst ive had with any company the customer support is virtually nonexistent and when you need any form of help this company proves that it couldnt care less i flew with my girlfriend from frankfurt to bangkok with a layover in riyadh the tvs in our row didnt work on both flights but otherwise the flights went okay and the food was pretty good once we landed in bangkok we realised my girlfriends bag had failed to arrive we had noticed in frankfurt that the saudia representative at baggage drop hadnt actually put the bag on the baggage carousel but at the time we didnt think much of it luckily we had an apple airtag inside the luggage so we could see it was still at frankfurt airport and had never left we reported it to the baggage department at bangkok airport although there were no saudia representatives in bangkok specifically we filed a baggage irregularity report and were told that saudia should send the bag within the next few days saudia never sent the bag to us we tried contacting them so many times over the following days and weeks we emailed so many email addresses that we found online but the majority of them were not even real accounts and so our emails failed to deliver we tried calling customer service representatives for saudia in thailand germany and the uk but either the phone numbers didnt work they just didnt pick up or they said they couldnt help at all and we just had to fill out the form online we filled out the online compensation form in august 2022 but to this day have received no response we spent nearly 100 on calls from thailand to saudias helplines but nothing worked we tweeted them many times and while they did message us back saying they would help we never heard anything further this was especially frustrating as the whole time we could see with our airtag that the bag was just sitting in frankfurt airport it was clear to us that saudia were making no attempt to find the bag eventually my girlfriends parents had to travel to frankfurt airport to find the bag they asked around and showed that they could find it with the airtag luckily with baggage staff at the airport they found the bag frankfurt airport then flew it over to us with thai airways and then we picked it up from phnom penh airport in cambodia more than two weeks after the bag had gone missing the worst part was that saudia never listened to us they have no customer service and did not offer any help we contacted saudia again and again to tell them we knew where it was but nothing we even went back to bangkok airport to talk to saudia representatives in person who are only in the airport at specific times when flights are happening they were friendly but offered no help blaming frankfurt airport for the issue when we contacted frankfurt airport they blamed saudia for not looking for the bag it was clear to us that if my girlfriends parents hadnt gone to the airport to find the bag it wouldve just been left there and eventually auctioned off we have still received zero compensation,3.0,1,1,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

8059,dragonair,3,value for money is horrible,flight itself was very smooth and take off and landing were good air hostesses were horrible very rude inconsiderate unprofessional and incomprehensible value for money is horrible because the inflight meal seems like theyve slapped some leftovers together a passenger next to me who had ordered the vegetarian meal was given a single puri indian bread without any condiments or vegetable side a pathetic excuse for a meal the non veg meal was hardly tolerable as well on a flight with mostly elderly citizens the hospitality was certainly not good,2.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
18702,south african airways,7,they went out of their way to help,flew johannesburg to london heathrow i have read many bad reviews of south african airways so i was pleasantly surprised with our experience on board economy seats were comfortable with sufficient legroom and recline the only issue being the excessively stiff seat pocket anything thicker than a magazine is difficult to stow on the flight to london we were given dinner and breakfast plus a good selection of drinks food choices were ok and if your choice was not in their cart the fas were happy to find the meal in another cart if they could they went out of their way to help service was generally very friendly polite and efficient cabin crew seemed to be enjoying their job too which makes a change from the sullen service on some european carriers inflight entertainment selections were a bit dated but ok the major problem was sound quality on this flight the movie voice soundtrack at my seat was completely garbled though the music track was fine perhaps the different language tracks were interfering as i mainly wanted to sleep on this overnight flight this was not a big loss overall i was satisfied by saas inflight service it was way above expectation ground service at or tambo airport is shockingly bad but thats another story,8.0,8,8,6.0,6.0,8.0,6.0
20081,thai airways,7,a fair way below pre pandemic times,on flight to and from perth to thailand on both flights the seats would not lock in position i think these sort of things need to be sorted out i realise thai airways are struggling at the moment but basic easy to fix issues like this should not happen entertainment system onboard has very limited selection but after all said and done you are there for travel not going to cinema hopefully this will improve the aircraft are looking very tired and could do with a good spit and polish inside basically the standard is a fair way below pre pandemic times needs investment so it can fairly represent beautiful thailand,4.0,6,6,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0
7549,copa airlines,1,i would 100 use them again,wanted to start off this review by saying remember most people only leave reviews when they have a bad experience so having said that our experience was great with copa airlines we booked in august 500 to costa rica and back which was a great deal and when i later checked the prices in october it was up to 1500 obviously reading the reviews i got so scared our tickets would be cancelled or something so i legit didnt start booking things for our trip until a week or two before the day of our flight came and everything checked out we checked in online easily i love that we got to pick our seats without paying not many airlines do that nowadays and when we got to the airport because we only had carryons and already checked in we were able to go right through security the two flights we took there left on time we were served a sandwich on the 5 hour one and were perfectly good flights crew was nice covid protocols were followed and we got to our destination on time i was also shocked we got our own entertainment service in economy class private tv with movies and games and a usb charger they also handed out headphones for free even thou i had some they are the iphone ones and dont fit for the tv so they gave me a pair ive been on other airlines where they wanted to charge me 16 we fly back in a few days and i have no worries at all i would 100 use them again and probably will if i can get good priced flights,10.0,9,9,5.0,9.0,9.0,9.0

14790,monarch airlines,8,smoothly and without incident,luton to romefiumicino this is my first experience of flying so prepare for potential ignorance we arrived extremely early to london luton to ensure no delays in our flight to rome a departure gate was given about an hour before the flight was due to depart which was when we first encountered the staff for monarch we had chosen to travel carry on only and had checked in digitally at present monarch does not provide the function to use an electronic boarding pass on your phone so we had to use printed boarding passes the staff at the gate were pleasant enough if a little distant it was apparent they had strict time deadlines and so politeness was kept to a minimum we spent about 20 minutes waiting in a stairwell for us to be able to board the aircraft luton doesnt have the facilities of the larger airports and so boarding was done via stairs fore and aft the plane in question is an a321100 which was fully booked though clean and tidy it had the appearance inside of being a little bit old but then i have no real experience elsewhere i am fully appreciative its a budget airline as well boarding took an age as the flight was jampacked but we still managed to leave roughly on time the cabin staff were all friendly enough the captain gave us a thorough commentary of the flight which is a nice touch after take off the refreshments run was made prices are steep but i expect nothing less on an airline sadly no refreshment provided with booking due to the short flight still food was presentable and reasonably tasty with both warm and cold options monarch did have a shopping round with some duty free goods available on the plane but unsurprisingly no one partook we arrived in rome very slightly ahead of schedule and disembarked quickly in all the staff remained courteous and professional throughout no one took issue with my hold luggage which i was expecting and the flight was conducted smoothly and without incident,8.0,8,8,7.0,8.0,7.0,7.0
8961,etihad airways,8,cabin was neat and clean the seats comfortable,as an airline enthusiast i chose etihad in order to experience a new gulf state carrier i had high expectations having immensely enjoyed earlier flights with emirates and qatar while not a flawless experience my flights with etihad confirmed their reputation the checkin experience in bangkok was a little contentious as the agent insisted that my tennis racket needed to travel as checked luggage this was a new experience after fifty years of air travel the miracle lounges that etihad uses at bkk are satisfactory but unexceptional i would say the same for the etihad lounge in abu dhabi the cabin was neat and clean the seats comfortable and the amenity kit full of useful and aromatic products predeparture champagne or a bellini was served in a flute and the cabin crew out of bangkok were warm and welcoming the crew from abu dhabi to milan were somewhat more subdued but given the 0245 departure time so was i i want to particularly commend the purser on my flight ey 407 from bkk she was helpful kind and engaging and her efforts moved this experience into one of my most positively memorable flights the mechanics of the flights departure arrival luggage delivery etc were all on punctual,8.0,8,8,8.0,9.0,9.0,9.0

8408,edelweiss air,5,most uncomfortable flights,most uncomfortable flights with edelweiss air between tampa and zurich in economy class the distance between seats the pitch appears to have been reduced a bit what makes it worse however is that the seat back recline is disproportionately huge when the passenger seating in front of you fully reclines his seat that seat back comes to about three inches from your nose and you are supposed to enjoy in this position the otherwise very good choice of movies and other entertainment available on your individual screen if you have any food or drink on your tablet when that passenger decides to slam his seat back to full recline it will be squished possibly spilling wine etc on your lap your only recourse is to hold that drink in your hand and in turn recline your own seat back encroaching on the passenger behind you and if you cant eat in that reclined position too bad the crew dont make the usual announcement that all the other airlines make when they serve food asking people to kindly bring their seat back in the upright position to accommodate their fellow travellersmost important thing for me is seat comfort particularly leg room would not use them again when traveling to zurich or beyond,3.0,5,2,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

5367,bangkok airways,8,okay on medium haul,bangkok to male in august 2018 as a regular user and premier member for bangkok air i was curious to see try their business class i had accumulated an excessive amount of miles which i used for this flight they charged about 200 in tax which is reasonable some airlines charge more or less tax for award tickets like these the flight was 34 full on the way to the maldives and completely empty on the way back at check in it was a strange feeling when i walked up to the usual business class counter to check in for my first international flight with them the premier lounge was quite empty when we were there first and then gradually filled up to capacity there is hot food table service but recently this has been discontinued there is only self serve but there are still madetoorder items available instead of doing a boarding announcement a gate agent walked around the boarding area with a sign up saying business classpremier members which is actually a much better idea than making an announcement i was first onboard and was asked what i would like to drink i settled with orange juice for a half past nine departure lunch was served and the quality and quantity was more than adequate they understand that you will definitely eat in the lounge and not feel that hungry once on board i felt that the clear plastic bowl of salad with royal project branding theyre a subsidised group of highquality farmers was a bit odd but then the salad definitely felt fresh the hot meal was also good and there were 3 choices we were also served macadamia nuts in a bowl before meal service i asked if there was any snack before landing and they only had more nuts drinks were plenty and me and my dad didnt realise we finished an entire bottle of champagne as they just kept refilling the seat is more than comfortable like a big lazyboy the crew seemed odd the usual interactive ness and downtoearth feeling wasnt there it felt as if asking for something in the galley something id always do was met with a weird look the flight attendant asked me to press the call button but i personally like going to the galley and asking for something as its better for both entertainment is provided in the form of an ipad and is adequate for the flight duration arrival in maldives i wish i could say that our bags were first off the belt but no it was quick though the return journey felt literally like a private jet we walked straight up to the counter and we were given fast track immigration turns out the regular line had no queue at all so we just went to the regular line boarding was called for 40 minutes before departure and we were still in the lounge when not 5 minutes later final call for flight pg712 to bangkok so we ran down to the gate there was no line turns out the load factor on this flight was 21 in total including economy passengers thats a 41 ratio of passengers to cabin crew leaving 30 minutes early then arriving 45 minutes early when we got to the gate which was a domestic gate the flight continues on to samui the crew shut the curtain between economy and made sure it stayed shut and we were whisked off to a private minivan the minivan took a shortcut to international arrivals and we were literally out without any other passengers in sight with our baggage in tow that is the best bangkok to male in august 2018arrival experience ever overall i am used to flying bangkok air on short routes and they perform okay on medium haul,9.0,8,8,5.0,7.0,8.0,7.0
13683,level,1,they lost my baggage,copenhagen to vienna i would encourage you to try to avoid this airline as much as possible because i traveled from copenhagen to vienna vk1021 2nd june 2019 and they lost my baggage i tried to call them several times a day for 13 days and they had no information whatsoever so i believed them and didnt try to do anything else on 14th day by complete coincidence i called baggage lost counter at vienna airport to ask them about my luggage they gave the location of my baggage and tried to solve the problem in any case i called level again just to confirm and they said sorry we forgot to tell you your baggage was found in prague they didnt reply nor had any more information so i hung up the phone i knew it was a waste of time i am still trying to locate my baggage i have lost a baggage before and received it with respect and compensation i am not against airline losing stuff but in this case i want to emphasize how terrible the services are if the customer knows more about his lost baggage than the customer care then company is already going downhill,2.0,3,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
14785,monarch airlines,5,flight was actually very pleasant,i havent flown with monarch for a number of years as i dont tend to travel on package holidays however on a recent trip to rome the airline offered a return ticket price which was substantially cheaper than any competetors which scheduled flight times which were perfect for a short city break early morning outbound late evening inbound the booking process was painless their website is easy to navigate and displays fully what you are getting for your fare at every opportunity after initial booking i opted to download the monarch app to try and stick to my mantra of being a 21st century traveller etix mobile boarding pass etc i was slightly disappointed that the app encouraged you to check in early and then made it appear that you could not proceed with booking until you had purchased a seat as i feel that this could mislead many families particularly those that arent very tech savvy however i understand that this is how low cost airlines operate and therefore ill put that issue to bed on arrival at bhx i was disappointed at how the check in desks were organised and operated my wife had 1x item of hold luggage that she had declared at online check in however we still had to wait in the mammoth 6am queue with those that had not yet checked in something that i feel could easily be rectified with a bag drop only desk or 2 following check in we proceeded through security to airside departures one thing i was quite surprised by was how early the airline called last call we were directed to the boarding area some 50 minutes before departure and then had to wait in said area or in our allocated seat what added further insult was the delay we then experienced with no direction from the cabin crew or flight deck we experienced a 20 minute doors closed delay alas we eventually got on our way and despite everything else i have said in this review so far the flight was actually very pleasant leg room is at a premium something i am not particularly bothered by as this is what you expect with low cost short haul the seats were comfortable with sufficient recline the pitch of the recline was such that it didnt chop the knees of the passenger behind which is commendable following departure the flight deck crew were informative and managed to recoup some of the time we lost on departure the cabin crew were pleasant and friendly they did 1x drinksfood service and 1x duty free service which is more than sufficient for 2 hours the inflight menu was quite pricey i only had a non premium gin and tonic however this still came to 8 expensive compared to land prices the meal deal however offers good value for money and shouldnt be frowned at overall the journey was smooth with a perfectly executed landing although the a321 we flew on was ageing c2007 you still had more comfort and opportunity for a nap than most other low cost airlines i have travelled with without the ground issues this would have been a good journey overall,8.0,8,7,6.0,7.0,8.0,6.0

12848,klm royal dutch airlines,4,airline jargon which isnt helpful,my concern isnt so much about the flights on the roundtrip i did but about the transparency and handling of complaints by the klm staff i booked a lightfare and one of the hidden features with that is no mobile boarding pass is available if you travel with handluggage only you get a checkin confirmation if youre lucky in case of my outbound flight i got the error sorry we cant check you in because a high priority comment sounds much like airline jargon which isnt helpful for the average traveler the night before the flight i went to the klm desk at amsterdam airport and they happily checked me in and explained the issue i called the call center twice before and their staff had no clue about the issue and couldnt give any explanation on the way back i had the same issue turns out on full flights they physically want to see your handluggage to see if it fits thats the apparent drawback if you book a discount class at klm,6.0,6,4,5.0,4.0,6.0,4.0

20820,transaero airlines,7,transaero airlines customer review,almaty to vienna via moscow domodedovo and return i was looking for a cheap ticket and they offered the cheapest i wasnt expecting much maybe thats the reason why i had a very good impression later for a 2star airline i think they are really fair we are both quite tall with my wife so we asked for seats next to the emergency exit where you have big legroom we got it for every flight food was enough and good staff were friendly easy transfer in moscow airport was very expensive though aircraft a bit old,8.0,8,8,7.0,9.0,8.0,8.0
5011,avianca,2,80 additional for a carryon bag,they charge 80 additional for a carryon bag there is language in the email communication i received and on the website stating that if your carryon is in compliance with the size restrictions you can have it sent to the hold at no additional charge i deliberately downsized and traveled with just the carryon and had it sent to the hold but they insisted on charging me 8000 each way despite my protestations when searching for flights by price this charge is not reflected in the quote so add another 16000 to get your actual price how is this not a scam also they charge extra for everything,3.0,6,2,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0

12014,jet airways,2,service is substandard,london to mumbai it was my first time experiencing jet airways and i think it is appropriate to say i wont be using them going forward the quality of service is substandard when comparing to other flight providers the price was the same as other airlines but i chose to use this airline for the hours they were flying i should have heeded the warning from relatives but knowing that i am not the first to recognise an issue in the services shows that the issue lies within jet airways their online check in system was ridiculous to say the very least youre allowed to check in upto 48 hours before your flight but have to pay for your seat if you want to check in 1248 hours before your flight ive never heard of such a far fetched scheme of course by the time you wait for free checkin twelve hours before your flight you can only have free seats in the most unorthodox seats so wave farewell to anyone you decided to travel with not to mention that you can only pick your meal and provide your emergency contact information if you check in online so checking in at the airport means you are given what ever they have left in the back and only told this when youre up in the air and if the situation where an emergency may rise you are screwed the staff at the check in counters looked like this was the last place they wanted to be and they appear to have an allergy to smiling i had to take 2 planes 95 hours from london to mumbai and then transfer to a 25 flight to amritsar thats 12 hours in total in this time they only gave one meal one poor excuse of a meal where i couldnt have more than 3 bites and i usually enjoy flight meals the second flight i had to pay for a coffee pressing the button to request services from the flight attendant worked in either two ways waiting 15 minutes until they come or the flight attendant arriving and pressing the button to cancel the call saying that they will assist you in a moment but surprise surprise they keep away from until you have to get their attention again on the first flight where i had to sit nearly 10 hours i thought to ask for some alcohol to at least relax and make the most of the trip only to be told that they dont have anymore this was 3 hours into the flight i dont even know what i paid for no food no booze and no sense of the word service the second flight also gave me the chance of witnessing others lack of being attended to this poor couple had to ask 3 times for a pillow for their baby they asked twice for some water but repeatedly being forgotten about meant the only thing they could do to get through their flight was go to sleep hopefully waking up to realise this flight journey was just a dream now i have been told that my return journey has been pushed up 3 hours with no choice for an alternative flight not looking forward to it since i have to wake up 3 hours earlier than initially planned so ill have to skip my hotel breakfast only to wait for another 10 hour flight that serves one portion of gruel,2.0,2,2,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

18281,singapore airlines,9,cabin crew were amazingly good,we flew lhr sin and sin lhr in december both flights were the morning a380 flights in premium economy so weve had best part of 27 hours experiencing the premium economy product boarding for both flights was painless both flights left on time and arrived slightly early the premium economy cabin on the a380 is right at the front and as such feels quite exclusive indeed there are only about 40 seats in the cabin in a 242 configuration to keep this review brief the seats were a major upgrade on the usual economy seats both in comfort and space the food was lovely we used book the cook for all our meals plenty of drinks brought around and if you needed a top up or a snack this was provided promptly again on both flights the cabin crew were amazingly good we paid about 600 each extra over and above the economy fare which at the time of booking meant our premium economy fare was double the economy fare so an extra 300 each way to be in premium economy is it worth it well yes it is but i add a proviso its worth paying extra as long as the extra you pay is no more than around 600700 for long haul return 600 economy vs 1200 premium that a no brainer if you have the cash then do it but 600 economy and 1600 premium then id personally say thats too much for what you get,9.0,8,8,7.0,9.0,8.0,9.0
19595,taag angola airlines,6,chose taag for its really low price,rio de janeiro to johannesburg via luanda we chose taag for its really low price the flight itself didnt have problems but cabin staff was arrogant the seats were the most comfortable economy seats ive ever seen lots of room for your legs and they reclined more than other airlines the food was okay we were served 3 times from gig to jnb the inflight entertainment was okay but in many seats the system or the screen was broken the biggest issue onboard was the air conditioner there is no individual air vent so in the beginning of the flights it was really hot and then it got progressively colder until you could barely stand it the blanket was enough for me but you should have a coat handy the ground service was mostly okay except during our layover in luanda we boarded and they took us on a bus to the plane there we waited for 15 minutes with the doors of the bus closed then they took us back to the boarding gate in the airport nobody ever told us what was happening or what went wrong the flight got delayed 20 minutes not a big problem but they should tell you what is happening,7.0,6,6,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0

12683,kam air,1,kam air customer review,have flown kam air and ariana airlines for years and notice very little difference between the two in regard to their poor customer service tendency to cancel or delay flights without notifying customers leaving hours earlier than scheduled or making unexpected stops in random destinations like tehran on a flight from kabul to istanbul recently most recently was kept waiting in terminal at kabul for 95 hours to finally leave for istanbul only to then make a stop in tehran that was unexpected even for the iranian officials that boarded the plane on the tarmac asking the flight crew why they had stopped there the flight attendants give very little customer service particularly to those in business class unless you are paying for just the extra space dont bother wasting the money and usually spend most of their time applying makeup or talking to one another while they make each other drinks but neglect their customers who are watching have had office staff give incorrect flight schedules to me resulting in extra days of layovers in various locations and when i complained about this to management we were openly laughed at by counter representative it is this type of poor customer service that i had grown accustomed to from ariana and never cared for but had hoped for much more from a nongovernment owned airline but i have been disappointed time and time again with kam airs lack of regard for its customers,3.0,3,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

1507,air dolomiti,4,situation we found ourselves in was a scary one,lufthansa flight from ewr to munich was 10 minutes late we were a group of 22 and we all raced panic stricken through the unfamiliar airport and customs to make this connecting flight leaving at 1115 only to be told at the gate 1111 that the flight had already left the air dolomiti employee began issuing new boarding passes for a 225 flight but seemed overwhelmed when the rest of our group caught up and sent them all to customer service which is a long way back where they had just come from a few people got lunch vouchers most did not why at least we all were able to get tickets for next flight which was delayed twice why couldnt they have delayed our original flight we were only minutes late we finally took off at 400 the situation we found ourselves in was a scary one anyone who has had a connecting flight knows how stressful it is when one flight lands later than anticipated it would have saved a dangerous run through the airport if a representative had met us or a message relayed over the loud speaker for all of us to go directly to customer service to be issued new boarding passes for a later flight not all of us are olympic track stars,5.0,5,6,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
19008,spirit airlines,2,i wish i had read reviews,i wish i had read reviews before purchasing a flight from spirit airlines i thought i was getting a bargain on bringing my bike for 75 round trip turns out that was only one way so it was actually 150 round trip but that was just the beginning after multiple gate and time changes my return flight was cancelled at 2a i stood in line for 2 plus hours with other people from a total of four cancelled flights by 430a i was rebooked on the earliest flight available the red eye that night i spent money on a lyft back to the area of the city that i was familiar with and was lucky enough by 8a to connect with a friend who let me charge my phone and laptop at their office so i could book a place to shower and nap if my time itself is not included i lost 350 on an airbnb lyft rides and meals if you value my time spent on this endeavor and i do add on another 240 altogether taking a chance on spirit airlines cost me an extra 437 paid for nonexistent wifi access on return flight bike return extra meals place to stay and cablyft rides out of pocket and another minimum 240 in opportunity costs so not only did i not save money i spent way more on this spirit airlines trip than booking my trip on american airlines would have cost me on a positive note i interacted with over a dozen polite cheerful and helpful employees of the airline two were obnoxiously rude and antagonistic one so much so that because of her alone i would hesitate to fly with spirit airlines again however they were so many other friendly and helpful employees that deserve a positive review i hope good things come their way,7.0,5,3,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

456,aerolineas argentinas,4,stay away from long haul,what started as a very pleasant trip with aerolineas argentinas ended up becoming one of the most bothersome long haul flights i have ever experienced i flew from rio de janeiro to new york with a long stopover in buenos aires and a switch of airports in that city rio de janeiro to buenos aires aeroparque aircraft used was a fairly new boeing 737800 flight was on time crew was friendly decent leg room and the food provided to us was very good nice sandwich with a traditional argentine alfajor cake and a good choice of beverages nothing really to complain about this flight buenos aires ezeiza to new york jfk aircraft used was a brand new airbus 330200 very modern plane with led ambience lighting good entertainment screens with a good selection of movies and music sounds great so far right well the downfall begins with the amount of leg room aerolineas argentinas have on this plane i take long haul flights at least 3 times a year and have had experiences with various airlines but i have never seen a plane with such little space as this one it was really uncomfortable the whole time because of the limited leg room i am 179 cm unlike my other flight on this trip with aerolineas the food served for dinner was horrible i didnt eat it at all worst food i have ever seen on a long haul flight and i heard other passengers complaining about it as well breakfast was decent but still overall very disappointed crew was uncaring and only offered water during the meal service not a single time did they pass around the cabin offering water to passengers my final thoughts regional and medium distance flights aerolineas does a pretty good job stay away from their long haul flights though,4.0,4,3,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0
17840,shandong airlines,6,crew was very attentive,surprisingly nice flight for a chinese airline the business class named first class is of the usual type in china ie 2 rows of 4 seats with old seats and small reclining angle the crew was very attentive wine chinese was decent and so was the food nothing special but ok reading material is of course restricted to the china daily and there is no individual entertainment but on a 4 hours flight especially on a night flight this is not essential flights both ways were on time i would recommend this flight as it is the only airline to fly directly between bangkok and several places in the shandong province schedule is terrible but it is still better than transferring,8.0,8,8,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0

20969,tui airways,7,economy seat with limited legroom,we flew out to the west indies two weeks earlier and had an excellent flight we were pleasantly surprised and before disembarking i told the cabin crew how much we had enjoyed the flight the aircraft was clean and tidy and the crew were very friendly and efficient with the inflight catering was more than acceptable what helped perhaps was that we left at 1000 and had a daytime flight heading west we also found subsequently that we were in extra legroom seats and this made a huge difference the homeward flight left barbados at 1700 and effectively became a night flight heading east with breakfast served at 0330uk time or 2330 barbados time we were also in a standard economy seat with limited legroom i am 1m82 and found it difficult to get comfortable when i reclined my seat after dinner the passenger behind took offence if one pays economy prices one does not expect frills but it might be worth obtaining one of the extra legroom seats on any longer flight,8.0,8,8,7.0,8.0,8.0,9.0

17388,s7 siberia airlines,5,a320 legroom was more,the hkgovb globus s7 flight was one of the worst flights ive been on the boeing 737800 looked really old and run down and was hot and stuffy for the 7 hour 30 minute flight hardly any legroom and very narrow seats my dads seat on 5c could not recline at all all the cabin crew on the flight seemed to have a bad temper which may be due to the fact that they only arrived 1 hour ago in hkg from a 7 hour flight from novosibirsk the seat was pretty uncomfortable and hardly reclines no entertainment food was fine and tasted good however the flight to moscow with s7 was better on the a320 where the legroom was more than adequate and the seats were designed better giving a more comfortable flight according to s7 airlines it states that one could bring as many carry on baggages but need to be under 10kg however in novosibirsk the ground service staff said only one and made us pay 2000rub to ship it to moscow i would fly s7 siberia airlines again in the future but i would avoid s7 globus boeing 737800 flights at all costs,6.0,3,6,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

13306,lan airlines,4,we wanted to buy better seats,we tried to select our seats many days in advance in all three lan airlines planes we had to take it was impossible to select or buy our seats in flight 600 to lax because the website wasnt working to select seats for this flight we called lan and they said they said that the website was working we also tried to buy better seats on the phone but they also said that we had to buy them only which it was impossible after many communications with them they checked in for us without asking for that with different seats 35b35c in the flight la600 that were different from the ones they informed us on the phone 30b20c finally we could get better seats at the counter in cordoba but their customer service is completely evasive and sometimes rude also we made our reservation some months ago with flight la952 at 500 pm from cordoba to santiago and then the company changed this flight leaving at 1200pm which caused that we had to stayed in a hotel in cordoba and spend 8 hours in santiago we bought la 952 at 500 pm because it was convenient for us otherwise we would not buy that combination of flights also the seats in boeing 787 are very narrow and short that is why we wanted to buy better seats,8.0,6,7,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
20101,thai airways,6,an obvious downgrade in service level,the boeing 787 looked shabby externally when it landed from bangkok with a very faded livery internally it was much the same and everything looked rather worn and unkempt including some sticking tape holding part of the seat edge together on row 41 washrooms were not what i would call clean food was soso two meals at start and approx 3 hours out from london plus a very odd tasting egg sandwich at about 6 hours in crew were friendly but not attentive crew call button was never responded to on the three attempts i tried at various points throughout the flight mask wearing was not enforced despite several pa announcements garbage wasnt collected nor were items such as blankets in general i dislike the dreamliner and try and avoid flying it which is getting harder to do 9 seats abreast feels a real squeeze in economy and the toilets are tiny and too few the difference between the thai 787 and the emirates a380 and 777 on the outward journey was stark both in terms of cabin comfort and service levels thai used to be great but an obvious downgrade in service level combined with operation of the 787 means a poorer travel experience im wondering what their a380 offering is like,2.0,5,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

449,aerolineas argentinas,6,average with room for improvement,buenos aires to london via rome i have flown business class in many airlines and this was my first time with aerolineas argentinas the aircraft was modern and business class was average with room for improvement main issue was that the seats are not fully flat food was as expected and the crew were friendly and helpful business lounge in buenos aires was below average the one supplied in rome by alitalia was superior outbound they left one of my bags in rome but arrived the following day and a zip was damaged which was very promptly and efficiently repaired at no cost on the way back it felt like a child care facility with four seemingly unaccompanied children two of whom were visited by a member of the cabin this type of freebie does not go down well when we have paid a full fee on the whole underwhelming but with a bit of more professionalism it could be up there with the best,7.0,6,7,6.0,6.0,6.0,7.0

21231,turkish airlines,5,old outdated equipment,tk is fabulous on the ground outstanding inflight with professional cabin service and best food in the airline industry and 1gb free wifi is amazing unfortunately all of that is wasted by the fact that they fly old outdated equipment with old outdated 222 configuration with zero privacy from your seatmate and people crawling over you or you crawling over them to get to aisle unless you are on the center section its a shocker that tk hasnt remotely kept up with their competition in this regard its like flying business class in the 1990s power ports in inaccessible locations rarely work seat controls inadequate so instead of a review of 1010 id love to give it gets knocked down to 510 as a result of all of this i would not use tk in this configuration unless there was no other choice or the price was very cheap they desperately need a refresh of this old livery or just new planes all four of my flights were old a330s that didnt even have privacy screens between seats what are they thinking,5.0,5,5,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0
13497,latam airlines,2,worst airline i ever flown with,by far latam is the worst airline i ever flown with not only the flight departed over 130 hour late but they charged a ridiculous amount of money per luggage for a family of 3 i paid 120 per check in bag each weighted 20 kilos one way and 80 per bag for the return flight i go to bolivia every year and whenever i purchase international tickets bags are included i will never flight or recommend latam to anyone,1.0,2,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

11316,icelandair,7,decently pleasant experience,i would have to say that i was quite thourghly suprised with my experience on icelandair i was at first a bit scared to fly with them after reading some of their reviews on here but i took my courage into my own hands and booked a ticket with them for my upcoming endeavour in iceland the ground crew at pearson wasnt the greatest as usual and were a bit cold and unfriendly but were serviceable boarding thankfully started on time and without much off a hassle but unfortunately our departure time was delayed by more then an hour thanks to some late connecting passengers and the rush to find and successfully load their baggage i have to give a special shoutout to our crew on this particular flight as they were absolutely lovely and were almost constantly present in the aisle checking on passengers the flight itself was perfectly fine the seat was comfortable enough with a fair amount of legroom and the ife screen was modern and responsive with a good selection of both local and foreign features the only drawbacks i would say for this flight would be the lack of a complimentary meal although the food options were all reasonably priced and looked decent and the fact that the inflight wifi didnt work at all during the entirety on both flights that i flew with them overall it was a decently pleasant experience and i would certainly recommend and fly with them again,8.0,8,8,7.0,9.0,8.0,9.0
8702,emirates,9,service could experience delays,checkin was easy at icn but with a disappointing lounge situation emirates does not own a lounge at icn inflight service was generally great although business class was quite full connection in dubai was also not problematic security for connecting passengers was fastflowing and shopping and restaurants were open second flight was on a b777300 but similar levels of comfort and service was for business class the business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people including myself the inflight service could experience delays as too many business class passengers are waiting to be served the transit lounge at dubai tend to be overcrowded and the inflight internet offering is far from satisfactory in my case the inflight internet could be purchased at 1999 for a 10hour flight excluding takeoff and landing the internet would only be provided for 8 hours at most and streaming would still be blocked,8.0,8,7,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

17656,saudi arabian airlines,4,service quality has decreased significantly,i am not completely satisfied with my recent experience with saudi airlines even though i hold alfursan silver elite skyteam membership unfortunately the service quality has decreased significantly in the recent period through several trips i noticed a big difference in terms of guest care when calling the customer service centre you will wait for no less than 30 minutes even when you were holding the premium membership and most of the employees if you reach them will not solve your request or make it complicated and not initiating the service the quality of food on board has deteriorated even to the business class and not only to the economy class and also the fulfilment of requests by ground staff or flight attendant mostly average to bad and i noticed a lack of flight performance to leave or arrive on time in several flights and also even a large increase in prices and in return without good service i used to choose saudi airlines previously for several reasons including the special membership that i carry which gives me many wonderful services beside the average to good service and reasonable prices but now i will make this company my third or maybe fourth choice even if my membership is reduced it does not matter much,4.0,5,5,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0

22170,vivaaerobs,8,had no issues and i would fly it again,we usually fly southwest when flying within the us but when flying from cancun to puerto vallarta we had to take this local low cost airline honestly we had no issues and i would fly it again the line was very long to check our bags but we knew it probably would be and arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes before our departure it took almost an hour to get through the line to check our bags but we saw that they would announce flights leaving soon and pull passengers out of line to check their bags so they could make their flights which was a nice touch because i feel like a lot of airlines in the us wouldnt do that and if you miss your flight tough luck you shouldve arrived sooner the plane was nicer than a lot of southwest airplanes with plenty of leg room in our row which was 29 one issue though i paid for seat assignments when i booked the flight and for some reason it reassigned our seats prior to check in and split our party of 3 up wasnt a huge deal bc i realized it when i went to check us in and was able to pick new seats for us 3 to be together however we had seats in the 8th row originally then it had to be the 29th row being a person who doesnt speak a ton of spanish which would be necessary to speak to an agent about it i can see that this may have been an issue if i werent able to change our seats online to be together,8.0,9,8,5.0,6.0,8.0,6.0

18031,silkair,4,the worst business class seat,chengdu to singapore absolutely the worst business class seat i have experienced the width of the 2x2 first 3 rows is acceptable but the legroom is absolutely appalling less even than i would expect in a normal premium economy seat plus limited recline circa 30 degrees from vertical upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing added to which the seat controls for recline footrest lumber massage are really stiff mechanical levers for a brand new plane absolutely abysmal there is no in flight entertainment in the seat backs in business one is issued with an ipad which can stream movies etc through the silk air wifi this does not support internet connectivity only the ife if you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the silk air app from the app store something nobody tells you before you board in the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the ipad even on the little plastic prop available on request so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever no noise cancelling headphones just cheap inear buds so i plugged my own noise cancellers in to the ipad no capability to connect via bluetooth of course i found it impossible to doze on the 45 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of english language films on the ipad literally the only redeeming feature of the whole miserable experience was the cabin crew who try their best to give high quality and attentive service i feel sorry for them having to pretend that they represent a proper business class operation which this manifestly is not,2.0,3,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

1989,air italy,6,service and food were fine,accra to milan the flight was fine the accra flight comes via lagos and it must be one of the cheapest ways to fly from west africa to europe 250 euro one way no bag the flight was only 50 full at most at check in i asked for and was given an exit seat which you would normally have to pay 70 euro for and as there was a clear row of four seats near the back so i moved after takeoff and slept for most of the flight the service and food were fine no in flight entertainment cabin staff were pleasant mostly italian and were happy to bring extra water when asked the boeing 767 was 20 years old and showed its age but it flew on time i wrote this review to counter all the 1 star horror stories now that qatar have invested in the airline hopefully some newer planes will start running the africa routes,8.0,8,8,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0

17568,sata air azores,5,web system could not handle request,toronto to gran canaria via ponta delgada administration and ticket sales were a huge disappointment i wanted to fly in business class but since we had legs of our trip with no business class availability their web system could not handle the request there were only 4 seats left for our international legs on the day we were ready to buy several months in advance of the trip so i booked through a reseller satas toronto office hours are not great on weekends however i first checked via email with the portuguese office to ensure that i would be able to upgrade after purchase bought the economy seats for all flights toronto to ponta delgada to gran canaria via madeira return with a short stop in pd when i attempted to upgrade our international legs toronto to ponta delgada return i was given a price about 50 higher than the business class premium should have been eventually one staff member told me that the upgrade now included a fee for changes the only remedy they offered was for me to check on flight days to see if there were any upgrades available of course there were not in fact the only response i got in toronto was a condescending smirk i tried contacting customer service and appealing to the logic of other representatives with no good result i understand penalties for changing dates or downgrading seats but they should really rethink policies that prevent a passenger from upgrading reasonably i am unlikely to use the airline again because of this policy as for the flights they were on time or within reason with no threat of missing connections flight attendants were pleasant the food and drinks were not great but always provided no hot drinks on short flights complimentary wine with meals only there is no onboard entertainment or usb plug ins there were monitors on the toronto to ponta delgada return flights but did not work there was a credit card slot so perhaps you could pay for service but i did not see anyone attempt it economy seats were not bad for size and comfort our toronto to ponta delgada flights were in row 22 just in front of the washroom this was great for the night flight but not great when passengers are awake lots of crying children i have no idea how they have the energy to cry so much and so loudly and how their parents can stand listening to it without remedy washrooms were abominable and smelled strongly of urine after about 3 hours into the flight they did replenish toilet paper and hand towels immediately when made aware of the need,6.0,5,6,5.0,6.0,5.0,4.0

14666,meridiana,3,flight was uneventful,we flew from london gatwick to olbia sardinia with meridiana the booking was a nightmare the online computer kept crashing and requesting me to try again after numerous failed attempts i rang the call centre for help all they could do was to instruct me to try booking two single tickets surprise surprise this too failed a whole day wasted and nothing to show for it the following day an instinct made me ring my credit card and was horrified to find that two payments had been taken from my account by meridiana yet no tickets provided to cut a long story short a total of 7 emails largely unanswered and 4 phone calls totaling 67 minutes at a cost of 37 i eventually got my tickets but no refund fortunately the credit card company were on the ball and credited the money owing this call centre is beyond useless i am dreaming that they may actually refund my phone bill having received my eticket the online check in was okay albeit in italian but there was no indication that the operation was sucessful boarding passes arrived the next day by email but were torn up on arrival at gatwick how odd standard tickets issued the check in was amazing for gatwick so quiet no queues and unhurried we seemed almost to be the only passengers the staff were friendly and we had plenty of time to stroll to the gate once announced boarding was delayed resulting in a 30 minute late take off the aircraft a boeing 737300 was around 20 years old but it was fine a capacity of around 120 is much lower than the regular 737s with less than 100 passengers the whole process through the airport was unhurried the flight was uneventful but we were given a roll and drink most unexpected these days my seat itself was comfortable but at 6 3 i did find my knees digging into the seat in front not so good there were two empty rows of emergency seats behind me but perversly was not allowed to sit there without paying extra a thought crossed my mind i have flown in these seats many times with other airlines and i have always been instructed to familiarise myself with the proceedure of opening the emergency exit in case of an emergency maybe meridiana are operating within airline regulations but with no one sitting next to the exit with knowledge how long would it take for somebody to reach the exit read and understand the instructions then execute during panic and possible darkness a disaster waiting to happen the departure from olbia was equally quiet and laid back and the flight to gatwick uneventful,7.0,7,8,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
16711,regional express,5,relaxed approach to service and punctuality,perth to albany rex has a relaxed approach to service and information and punctuality on board is very convivial nice genuine service for the short flight and with the pilots saying hello before you step up on board but everything else can be weirdly substandard for 2018 out of the last 8 flights on this sector half have been delayed or cancelled the fun starts with the latter little information or support is provided when things go wrong you will receive no direction in writing what to do so listen carefully to the gate announcement if the plane is cancelled recovery flight at 7am be at gate around six thats it if you gave a hearing or sensory impairment you are a bit doomed there is an option to purchase a 5 insurance for delays at every ticket purchase probably a good deal given the frequency of delays but little information on website what to do if a delay also if the west coast the call centre closed so good luck in summary drive albany to perth if you can if you cant always purchase the insurance and make contingencies on travelling for business as it is not reliable but if you get onboard and away on time it is not an unpleasant experience,7.0,7,6,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

12085,jet2com,5,overall must do better,they are lowcost no ife take a good book to readno free food but reliable and honest with transparent pricing and their inclusion of 22kg luggage in the ticket price makes them a deal cheaper than lots of other lowcost carriers until my last trip the worst i could say was that the music they play over the pa during boarding was loud and irritating especially as they seem to be only prepared to pay royalties for one song played ad nauseam however on my last trip the mighty have fallen departure of the flight was delayed by a whole hour not much of which was made up during the flight the only explanation was operational reasons which could mean anything from an unfavourable conjunction of the planets upwards on the return again delayed albeit by only 40 minutes which was never even mentioned at the airport or on the aircraft i was disappointed and hope in future they will buck their ideas up and i was just unfortunate with this trip but overall must do better,6.0,4,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
20093,thai airways,6,there is no consistency with their product,this was the fourth long haul flight i have taken with thai airways in the last three months i can say there is no consistency with their product every flight has been completely different for example all the other flights you had wine with your meal then a drink afterwards although they had wine on the trolley they wouldnt let you have a glass this time you was allowed a maximum of 2 beers which for a 12 hour its rather stringent i found the flight attendants to be unfriendly and not willing to help food quality was ok movie choice not great still the direct route is convenient,5.0,6,6,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

20501,thomson airways,5,787 details are mostly gimmicks,gatwick to barbados with thomson airways we travelled out in premium economy on the boeing 787 where service was good and food surprisingly good and plenty of drinks seats quite comfortable but in recline with no seat tilt means you tend to slide a lot on return in economy and what a difference leg room good but seat narrow and not comfortable fortunately person next to me was quite small hate to think what it would be like with some one large why do airlines persist with the 333 configuration i know they want to cram as many as they can in but surely with a bit of thought they could be really inovative and try 243 same number but would satisfy more grouping of passengers food ok but pay for drinks even water the supposed revolutionary details of this plane are mostly gimmicks the dimming windows overruled by crew are nothing more the overhead luggage is unusually low so watch your head the larger windows are hardly noticeable and unless someone told you they were larger i am sure you would not know the air may be cleaner but i was not particularly aware certainly still get jet lag so all things considered its just another plane at leasts its new so not in too bad condition one final point not enough toilets in economy never seen such a long queue,7.0,7,7,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0

6197,brussels airlines,2,extremely poor service,copenhagen to brussels this is more of a goodbye review than a review of one specific flight having lived abroad different places over the last fifteen years i have always stayed loyal to the local airlines to benefit from their loyalty programs and hopefully also get something back from the airline as a thank you for always choosing them i do not have a specifically high income but i do have to travel a decent amount of time that means i always travel economy except from when i upgrade with miles i have earned i was a member of sas for many years followed by a four year spell in london where i only flew british airways during those years experiences nice surprises like a little upgrade every once in a while i would say at least twice a year based on 3040 flights on brussels airlines i have experienced 0 upgrades in five years i have qualified as frequent flyer every year i have lived in brussels which means ive always had 30 flights i am grateful for the lounge access i have been given in brussels but apart from that all the time i have been living in brussels i have not felt like i have been given the personal experiences or dealt as appreciated as i felt when being a member of sas and ba i am still living in brussels but decided a while ago to change all my coming flights back to sas as ive had it with extremely poor service from brussels airlines on a general basis rude staff poor service nothing back to loyal customers i have it a patient try but im looking forward to sas which provides their plus program extremely cheap compared to brussels business service more miles frequent free upgrades and better service in general this last flight was the perfect reminder of the choice i have already done both legs to and from copenhagen provided extremely poor service no more food on flex and fast and forced to check in my soft luggage with my laptop due to a full flight the airlines can thank themselves for this policy,2.0,3,2,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0

21175,turkish airlines,1,a horrible start to our summer holiday,my wife and i have the worst experience ever with turkish airlines they delayed our first flight multiple times due to technical issues and finally after an entire night of delays they cancel the flight but they did not release our tickets to allow us to get reschedule our flights so we spent all night on the phone with our booking agency and the airline help center but nobody can help us until turkish airlines start their shift the next day not until 10am when we return to the airport the next day we are told that we have been put on the same flight but when we get to the gate they are already delayed again after about 30 minutes of waiting the staff have no answers and one of the gate employees even tells my wife if you want to make it to your destination on time you should book another flight with a different airline turkish air will reimburse you because of the delays so with that bit of terrible advice we book another flight and try to leave the airport to check in with the new airline but at immigration we are told that we cannot leave as our tickets have not been released again by turkish air and we were supposed to be escorted by an airline employee to immigration to fill out paperwork so we can leave we end up sprinting through the airport as we are told by the information desk that the delayed flight is now boarding so we finally make it to istanbul where a turkish airlines employee stops all passengers with connecting flights and says he will escort us to our gates after leisurely walking us through the airport he points down a long corridor and says our gate is at the very end so we sprint once again to the gate only to find that the gate has already been closed and they would not reopen it for the 1012 passengers who needed the transfer so we watched as the plane pulled off the jet bridge and onto the runway feeling like we had been slighted once again in all we are still trying to get our money back for the extra flight we booked under turkish airlines advice and we had a horrible start to our summer holiday no matter how cheap their flights are we wont be flying turkish air ever again,1.0,1,3,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
15710,pacific airlines,2,there is no inflight entertainment,at first i booked a ticket to a vietnam airlines flight 2 days before but i could not board the flight because i just had a surgery and the minimum time since the surgery was done did not meet the requirement for boarding a flight therefore i changed the ticket to this flight pacific airlines flight pic6230 from ho chi minh city to qui nhon boarded on september 1 2022 delayed for 20 minutes due to late arrival perhaps its common for pacific airlines because another flight on that day was also delayed for the same reason taxi time before takeoff 22 minutes the aircraft still arrived on time even if the delayed time and long taxi time was dismissed inflight entertainment it was a disappointment because there is no inflight entertainment at all no magazine only a menu for food and beverage food and beverage there are still some choices for food and beverage as mentioned in the menu even on a short flight although i have to pay cash to buy it seat comfort decent i can change the angle of the chair so that i can relax and try not to hurt my shoulder because of the surgery the landing at phu cat international airport was hard which was quite unexpectedly shocking overall this was an unexpected flight because i couldnt board the vietnam airlines one 2 days prior so i really cannot say whether i would recommend this airlines or not,7.0,6,5,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

4643,asiana airlines,6,uneventful comfortable flights,seoul tp phuket return i had thoroughly enjoyed my flight on their a350 from london so was looking forward to my flights to phuket on this route it was an a330 2x2x2 layout the cabin was half full the seating was ok but looked more like ugly pods and rather old fashioned the seat controls were confusing but i did manage the sleeping position being 6 hour night flights i was also able to get a couple of hours sleep both ways the flight attendants were courteous but the service was rushed the dining was disappointing dinner on the way out but breakfast on the way back at 11pm at night both were hurried and did not see the crew until landing time when they came around with hot towels on both flights i requested a pre dinner aperitif but it was served with the meal the wine the desert all on one tray except the main course on my return flight i asked again for my pre dinner drink to be served before the meal which was noted with a smile but again came with everything on one tray i dont know whether there was specific reason for this as on the london route food served was a proper dining experience still the food was tasty yet with only one item for desert the ife was useless kept cutting off and manipulating it was frustrating uneventful but comfortable flights nothing to shout about expect to say asiana could update their a330 seating and dining service,7.0,7,7,6.0,7.0,6.0,7.0

16998,royal brunei airlines,6,crew were warm and welcoming,bangkok to melbourne via brunei for this journey royal brunei offered an all inclusive fare seat allocation meals bag at a great price this review relates to the return bangkok melbourne the first leg from bangkok to brunei on an older a320 was ok then three hours in brunei made quite pleasant by the newly renovated airport which feels airy and spacious if a little sombre i find the lack of alcohol on the planes and at the airport in brunei quite refreshing so this wasnt a concern for me seats on the 787 overnight flight to melbourne were comfortable even for a taller person made better by the fact that the plane was only around half full and the fact that the very considerate person in front of me never reclined her seat i have never travelled on a full 787 so cannot comment on how comfortable the 9 across format would be on a full plane my special meal was very nicely prepared and the crew were warm and welcoming doing waterjuice runs as well as a snack run sweet or savoury towards the end of the flight i spent most of the nights watching movies from a reasonable selection of us and foreign language films only major problem at no time did i see any member of crew cleaning the toilets and more than an hour before landing the floor of the nearest toilet was disgusting a deal breaker for me,8.0,8,7,7.0,9.0,8.0,7.0

5413,bangkok airways,7,aircraft interior was starting to show its age,chiang mai to bangkok flight pg228 onboard an older airbus a319 flight was slightly delayed due to the late incoming aircraft the lounge at chiang mai airport was fairly basic sandwiches juices and a popcorn machine but definitely set the airline aside from its competitors the aircraft interior was starting to show its age seats were wide and spacious yet the appearance was subpar even to low cost carriers such as airasia flight was approximately at 90 capacity with some empty middle seats cabin crew were professional and enthusiastic from boarding to disembarking a full meal was distributed yet left a lot to be desired metal cutlery was provided definitely a nice touch as some other full service carriers dont provide them touched down in bangkok 5 minutes later than scheduled and ferried by bus back to the terminal bags were a little slower to arrive due to the far proximity of the area from where the aircraft was parked upon arrival overall for the price i paid for this flight 40usd i had an enjoyable experience and i wouldnt hesitate to use them again,8.0,8,8,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

15665,openskies,6,openskies customer review,we have twice now flown the newark orly route on open skies originally in april 2012 then again in december the first time the flight was described as biz seat and the entire airplane was configured with their biz seats these are good but not great seats adequately sized for the most part but just not quite long enough for a 6 ft individual and 100 manual recline and leg rests the portable av systems were in many ways superior to the typical major carrier central av systems but on both outbound and inbound legs the batteries were not adequately charged and it ran out before arrival no backup so i was out of luck the all biz seat arrangement meant fast loading fast unloading and relatively rapid bag delivery food and wine were not bad but nothing special on time for the most part good enough to do it again in december by december the offering had morphed a bit same seats but now the plane was a 757 and was configured as biz bed business class prem plus premium economy the prior biz seat config and regular 6 across economy the seats were the same the foodwine in prem plus were strictly economy sub mediocre and the baggage delivery horrible at ory the av systems had been upgraded to new ipads which worked well but still needed more management of battery charging the prior rapid boarding was lost with the larger plane and 3 class seating bottom line at 1250 per person rt its a lot more comfortable than economy but you no longer get a biz lounge invitation and the food was really bottom of the barrel id do it again because the itinerary is perfect for my needs but dont do it if youre expecting business class at economy pricing,8.0,8,7,5.0,6.0,6.0,6.0

8517,egyptair,1,the most unpleasant flight,i was on flight ms986 on thursday january 20 2022 from nyc to cairo this was the most unpleasant flight i have ever taken the flight crew was rude and condescending and did not enforce any air travel rules including the wearing of masks by travelers it was quite unbelievable how little regard the crew had for the travelers they were impolite and generally unavailable to helpserve the passengers at one point during the flight i found the crew in the rear cabin of the plane joking around and ignoring requests of the passengers the rest rooms were filthy and about 2 hours into this 10 hour flight there was no toilet paper or hand wash in the restrooms the temperature in our cabin was about 75 degrees and several passengers including myself requested that some cool air be put on in the cabin the first time this was requested the temperature cooled for about 45 minutes after that our requests were ignored and the cabin was at uncomfortably hot temperatures for the remainder of the flight fortunately my flight back to the us on egyptair on february 7th was a pleasant one so i do not completely denounce egyptair but feel the crew on that flight i took be reprimanded for the horrible service provided on that long overnight flight to cairo,2.0,3,3,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

15274,norwegian,7,seat is really up there at the top,gatwick to miami i was unable to check in using the app and was told in the app that airport check in was required at gatwick this was surpringly swift the norwegian desks were straight ahead from emerging from the exit from the railway terminal at the south terminal a quick stop at the kiosk to check in and collect my boarding card the machine without prompting also printed another boarding card that acts as your lounge access pass very efficient there was no queue at the premium bag drop so i was straight to the agent via the security officer asking the usual questions bag drop done in seconds and headed to security screening norwegian does not provide fast track security at gatwick but this wasnt an issue as it was really quick and i was airside in about 3 minutes gatwick process and technology not making us remove laptops and liquids the lounge offering for norwegian premium flex customers at gatwick is the third party mylounge whilst smart and comfortable has a very basic fb offering but it was a relaxing way to start the day i deliberately didnt board until nearer departure so again had no queue at the gate where there is priority boarding for premium customers once on board and after easily finding stowage for my back pack i was offered a glass of water apple juice or orange juice a bit dull a glass of even prosecco would have been well received i had seat 1a by the window this front row seat is by the bulkhead and whilst offers no extra legroom than the other premium seats the front row has a major advantage no passenger in front reclining into your space from my experience flying premium on other carriers this seat is really up there at the top the leather covered armchair is wide with about 46 seat pitch with a lot of recline and an extendable calf supporting foot rest whilst a flat bed it is not it is very comfortable the ife comes out on a stalk from one of the arm rests and was easy to use this even allows you to order drinks or snacks at your seat in between meal services but i was surprised how poor and dated the choice of movies was i really struggled to find something i wanted to watch the inflight service did not start until we had departed about an hour this was a drinks service and in premium beer wine and nonalcoholic beverages are free of charge throughout the flight but if you want a cocktail you have to pay i chose red wine though both wine offerings were low end there are no pretzels nuts or other snacks offered unless youre prepared to pay for them which is a bit poor the main meal was delivered about 30 mins later together with more drinks as i was in the first row there was 3 choices available i would say the food quality and quantity was on par with the likes of a ba premium economy meal but it looked cheap as it is served in this flimsy long cardboard box holder with the entree still in foil and metal and very cheap plastic cutlery the crew were responsive if you requested more beverages throughout the flight but not particularly warm or friendly about 90 minutes out of miami a second meal service was offered this was a salad with meat and bread rolls offered perfectly adequate quality and quantity as not the main meal again a full beverage service was offered identical to with the main meal de planing was delayed by 510 minutes due to issues with the jet bridge bags delivered about 1520 mins after clearing immigration,9.0,9,9,6.0,7.0,8.0,7.0

18232,singapore airlines,6,seats were hard and uncomfortable,we travelled on singapore airlines many years ago in economy class we travelled this time in business class because of the long flight the service provided on the latest trip was very good however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good the biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class the seats were hard and uncomfortable a weird cover was provided to increase comfort the problem was no calf support and any way shape or form this has a big impact on leg comfort there was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless the second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable i do not understand why singapore airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling the outcome is of course we wont be travelling business class with singapore airlines again which is really sad,3.0,3,4,5.0,6.0,4.0,5.0

10666,gulf air,7,this low price comes with drawbacks,gulf air is seen as a costeffective airline option in the middle east but this low price comes with drawbacks one issue is the lack of a separate lane for business class passengers at checkin in paris which can create disorganization and is not appealing for those seeking a seamless experience the ground staff has also been criticized for being unprofessional and confused at times highlighting the need for better training furthermore gulf air does not have its own lounge facilities and instead relies on air frances lounge in paris raising concerns about exclusivity champagne served on board was warm showing a lack of attention to detail gulf airs affordability is a selling point for budgetconscious travelers but there are compromises the lack of a separate business class lane unqualified ground staff reliance on external lounges inattentive service and warm champagne all exemplify the compromises passengers may have to accept for a lower fare those who value a highquality travel experience may be left wanting more,5.0,5,6,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

3002,air transat,4,they have changed our selected seats,we paid for eco plus despite having the basic economy tickets and then booked my elderly grandmother separately on the expensive exit row seats to ensure she had enough room to manoeuvre upon boarding the plane i realise they have changed our selected seats which we paid for without telling me and so then have to speak to the stewardess about asking other people to move they also switched my aisle seat for a middle seat which i find ridiculous on top of that these seats we had paid a lot of extra money for were the most uncomfortable seats i have ever sat in they are designed with a immoveable armrest that is tiny we all came off the plane with bruises on our thighs because of the tightness of the seat the flight was genuinely painful and none of us are extremely big people so i can only imagine someone who is a bit bigger would genuinely be unable to sit in that seat for the flights duration,2.0,2,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0
2083,air macau,5,the poor condition of the plane,i used air macau for a roundtrip from tokyo to narita i was able to get the tickets for a quite low price so i was not expecting much from this airline at the end i was able to get a fair flight from them but there were still some issues that made my journey inconvenient the thing that bugged me was that some items in the cabin seemed to either have issues or was nonfunctional one of them was the tray tables it was mandatory for me to use it as both of my flights included 1 meal but whenever i try to place my food tray on it it keeps sliding towards me it was quite annoying at the time also in one of my flights my seat recliner was broken despite the poor maintenance the cabin staff was very friendly and helpful on both of my flights overall air macau is a minor airline and passengers shouldnt expect much from them if you are a person that doesnt mind the poor condition of the plane and want a straight flight to macau then i would recommend this airline to you if not then i would rather suggest taking other flights heading to hong kong and using the ferry from hong kong to macau,7.0,7,7,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

16789,rex airlines,3,cabin crew were substandard,sydney to gold coast cabin crew were substandard and barely coping the loads were full but sitting in a window seat i was ignored and disregarded for service and had to try and get the attention of the attendant for water because she was so pre occupied with the couple beside me when she reached me she hurriedly threw a glass of water at me without an apology also over a lunch break surely we could have a savoury refreshment instead of a chocolate brownie thrown at you i will probably avoid rex to travel on again,2.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

15638,openskies,3,service seems to be falling apart,openskies service from paris ory to new york jfk seems to be falling apart its run with ancient 757s which at least in the cabin seem well past retirement age the biz seats are tattered incredibly cramped without any storage space so that its essentially impossible to get any work done they are rock hard with strange lumbar support which might work for a night flights sleep but left me with a painfully stiff neck after reading through the day flight ife is on an old ratty ipad which barely functioned both sound and picture faded in and out at times the food and wine were fine and the flight attendants service courteous however after lunch service they disappeared two positive notes the lounge at ory was comfortable and decently catered and the service ran on time i flew on air miles but if i had paid for the flight i would have been very disappointed with myself for not having opted for af ba should either scratch this run or bring it up to basic standards,5.0,5,5,5.0,6.0,6.0,4.0

14391,mahan air,5,mahan air customer review,tehran to kerman iran domestic flight cant say i was looking forward to this flight as iranian airlines have a chequered history the check in was very fast despite the disorganised queuing arrangements one female agent checked in the whole flight herself the aircraft a300 was very old and it showed very shabby inside the 8am flight was full and the air con was not very efficient so everyone was overheating seat pitch standard for short haul economy safety announcements in english and farsi on overhead monitors interestingly just before take off the video showed soothing images accompanied by what i presume was religious texts read by a comforting voice it had a nice calming effect live camera in the nose gave us a captains view of take off and landing breakfast was ok usual pastries juice and jam tea was very nice 90 minute flight touched down on time most of my fellow travellers seemed to be business men but some families also the mostly female cabin crew worked hard and were very pleasant even though their khaki green uniforms were not the most attractive overall i was glad when we landed safe and on time not an airline i would recommend but this was a basic domestic service and its an airline i had to use as its the only one on this route the aircraft on the return journey was in far better condition,7.0,7,8,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0

20307,thomas cook airlines,6,flight was actually ok,zante to glasgow first time in 5 years flying thomas cook so was unsure if it would be as bad as the previous trip we got to glasgow airport two hours and a half before takeoff to be met with a queue of hundreds at the tc desks two checkin desks open utter chaos finally got booked in after an hour and 15 mins they had to ask people on the corfu flight to come forward as they would miss there flight if they had stayed in the queue we got checked in then up and joined the queues at passport control got through eventually and got into the departure lounge in time to grab a cup of takeaway tea as the flight started boarding not a good start but the flight left bang on time 630am we had ordered pre booked meals these were served after a drinks round which left no where to put your meal down utterly bizarre we usually go with jet 2 who serve meals first and you get a choice thomas cook just get a meal placed in front of you no choice at all it was breakfast so was not too bad and the flight was actually ok just need to sort out the boarding check in procedures and maybe give people a choice of meals which you are paying for but as for flights both were ok home leg from zante was 45 mins late but no big deal,8.0,8,8,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0

7200,cityjet,4,seemed to be the cheapest,cork to london city airport i chose cityjet as they seemed to be the cheapest the reviews were mixed and i decided to try it anyway first off i decided to just take hand luggage as it was very expensive to choose extra luggage however after a week or so i found out that there was luggage included up to 23kg nowhere was i informed of this which could have led me to pay extra for it this should be shown when ordering but it was not the airplane from cork to london city was quite small i think it had about 1315 rows and the plane was less than half full on both ways the aircraft was very noisy i had to turn up my headset to full volume to be able to listen to the music the flight attendants were friendly both ways however very slow to serve drinks and food it was already a pretty short flight of 1 hours and 20 minutes there was however drinks included also alcoholic drinks and a snack a pack of biscuits on the way to london on the way back a msli bar i did not expect any food or drinks so that is fine i appreciate the very fast support and response from cityjet on twitter though the seats were fairly small and not comfortable to sit in at all and there was no wifi,7.0,6,6,6.0,7.0,8.0,6.0

1682,air france,2,service and aircraft are not up to the standards,would definitely never fly again with air france or delta 1 i got my ticket from delta and upgraded later to premium economy the email i got from delta says that my second checked luggage is free from jfk to ist see attached photo air france ground crew at jfk said that it is free only for jfk to cdg and that i had to pay for cdg to ist although my bags were going directly to ist after checking in delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading 2 my premium economy seat footrest was broken it was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat infront of me so that was also broken see attached photo for an upgraded seat that i paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it a cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with air france and that is the only thing that they can do 3 on both ways in cdg transfer while going to the us and coming back from the us and flying to ist there is a security control with long lines getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control overall i am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with air france or delta and probably direct flight from turkey to us would be better because the cdg is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminalsgates in terms of services shops food and lounges these tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards and when you upgrade and pay extra hoping that you will get some rest and sleep the seats dont function as per my case,1.0,4,4,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

17209,rwandair,9,airline could be a good option,gatwick to kigali return with a stop in brussels each way during which you stay on the plane i was astonished at how good this airline was given prior experiences of african airlines it is as good as the better european airlines the planes seem to be pretty new ours was a 2 year old airbus a330 the seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room even in economy the food was pleasant which is always a surprise on any airline in economy the cabin crew were very friendly and professional the return flight was on time and whilst there was a short hour delay outbound this was due to the ongoing air traffic control shambles in europe this summer not the airline the only hiccup was a lost bag on the way back but this was resolved efficiently by the airline despite a complex onward itinerary and the gatwick luggage desk said it was extremely rare to have lost bag on this airline suggesting it is not a systemic issue a final point although we were not connecting in kigali many passengers were they appear to hold onward flights in the event of delays so as a connecting option for various african destinations this airline could be a good option,9.0,8,8,7.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

1700,air france,3,my advice is avoid air france,avoid af if at all possible arrogant rude cabin crew and the worst food ive ever received in the class of flight starting point was the cabin wasnt fully ready even when the aircraft doors were closed ready for push back finally offered a welcome drink and i requested a perrier water but it never arrived and was later informed that on the french national carrier there wasnt any dinner arrived and was so poor in terms of quality that i opted for some packet biscuits chocolate wouldnt have said no to some crisps but guess what there were none took for ever to get a cup of mint tea after the dinner service as all bar one of the crew disappeared the best that can be said about the breakfast meal is that at least the fruit was edible just at least the seat became a full flat bed but my advice is avoid air france,2.0,2,1,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

11877,japan airlines,5,a screaming infant,tokyo to taipei first the flight was delayed at the gate after boarding for more than 45 minutes taxi for another 30 minutes so the plane was late leaving and late arriving in taiwan the food was so so for business class really it could have been better gate staff also were not well organized it is surprising for japan the lack of signs at the airport gate area and the size of the gate area were terrible passengers did not know which lines to go to and business and first class passengers also had to fight through the crowd to board the biggest problem with the flight was a screaming infant across the isle flight attendants did nothing the parents and grandparents also did nothing it was horrifying people should not be traveling with infants period for any reason unless they are moving abroad these were typical selfish parents who insist to travel with their family and could careless about other people the flight was full and their kid was crying the whole time which means their kid was not comfortable this selfishness has to stop and airline staff and airlines need to address it instead of ignoring it i paid good money for a business class seat and yet i had to endure this nonsense the entire flight i am sympathetic in most cases where a kid may act out for a short period of time but this was ridiculous,3.0,3,6,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

1760,air france,6,the in flight experience was fine,we were able to fit everything into carry on luggage which was helpful especially outbound on the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control check the bags then get back into the passport line this was frustrating but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didnt actually have a problem in addition the employees marshaling the passport lines were very headsup and were moving people to fill gaps in the line they also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon including those in english we were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to jfk but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged all of this means we were very fortunate since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and we didnt have to deal with af ground service which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than ok either the in flight experience was fine although af is one airline where it pays to fly premium economy we flew regular economy because of the size of our group and the service was less cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service much more attentive the further forward you go which is not a very passengercentric strategy the aircraft wasnt new but had been refreshed ife worked and had lots of options outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time return flight was on time in premium economy or business class air france an excellent airline but in economy its a little disappointing af could learn a lot from delta which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin or even from united which is mediocre front to back most of my international travel is to france and most of that is on air france this is unlikely to change still i live in hope that air france ups its game on the service front,8.0,8,8,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0

8883,ethiopian airlines,4,maintenance and cleanliness is a disgrace,although this is an 787 one of the newer aircrafts of ethiopian airlines the maintenance and the cleanliness is a disgrace service is ok crew werent enthusiastic but at least got the job done seats are ok considered its 3x3x3 many seats have malfunctioned entertainment systems the meals were so so the toilet is not kept clean and in a sorrowful state all the windows on the left side of the plane failed to darken causing passengers on that side suffering from too much glare form the sunlight many had to use their pillow to block the window which was funny to see lucky for me this is only a 2 hour flight the plane touched down in hk airport very roughly with a loud thug and a huge bump which startled and frightened all of us for safety and hygiene reasons i wont fly with them again,3.0,4,4,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
3977,alitalia,8,enjoyed our alitalia flight,we returned from cape town to amsterdam via johannesburg and rome the first sector was on saa johannesburg is a tricky airport to transfer from domestic to international terminals are far apart and it requires recheckin security and passport control then more long distance walking our 1h30 connecting time just got us as last passengers onto azs flight to rome with minutes to spare the club cabin on azs a330 is nice with incredibly comfortable private and spacious seating all window seats are singles slightly staggered so some are closer to the windows then others but all allow for good views from the windows azs amenity kit is gorgeous proper printed menus for food and wine were handed out predeparture bubbles water and juice international papers followed although azs pillow is of disposable quality the pillow case is beautiful and the blanket is fine too az is obviously taking ontime performance seriously all our flights left spot on time or early dinner started quickly after take off alitalia sets individual tables no trays this gives almost a first class feeling beautiful linens glass and silverware dinner is a five course affair of solid quality the pasta dish was gorgeous and a full meal by itself so far azs product is with the absolute top the only aspect that could be better is the staff they are so rough around the edges and most interactions are rusty they are okay but not overly friendly or proactive it seems they avoid interaction what a pity because this created a rather frosty atmosphere in the cabin the purser did not make any effort to interact although she was constantly in the cabin with paperwork dealing with her team as if we were not there no welcome how are you or goodbyes from her sleeping on board is fine although the cabin was too hot luckily window seats have individual vents seats in the middle dont so i would avoid those seats breakfast was rather italian with no options and sweets only also breakfast was served in total darkness which i gather is not a problem for passengers who have individual lights but i guess not ideal for the staff arrival was ontime but rome airport was its usual mess we enjoyed our alitalia flight and recommend it,9.0,9,8,6.0,7.0,8.0,8.0

21788,virgin america,4,my experience wasnt the best,very unhappy about my overall experience i flew to and from seattle to san francisco and back both in first class on virgin america the staff on the way down to san francisco was not very attentive didnt come around much to check for drinks or food then on my way back home my seat was broken the lumbar section kept inflating and deflating the whole flight my headphone port to watch a movie was not working properly it would not get loud enough for me to hear the movie so needless to say my experience wasnt the best,3.0,4,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
7299,comair,4,online check in is archaic,cape town to durban with comair british airways check in process is pathetically slow long queues and no process to call passengers for earlier flights entitled passengers who jump queues because they are more important than you arrived over an hour early and waited over half an hour before being checked in electronic checkin at the airport did not work either online check in is archaic does not even have a link to stocard on iphones being a foreigner its no use sending to my mobile number as im not on roaming past that the security process took another 15 minutes which made us literally run to the gate not a pleasant process learn something from overseas airlines on how to get passengers through an airport its not like the airport is even remotely busy,3.0,5,5,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0
427,aerolineas argentinas,6,provided the mere basics,they were essentially no frills and provided the mere basics on a flight granted on a 1 hour flight air france provides a drink and a croissant or similar pastry whereas only drinks are provided with the same flight time for a three hour flight only a snack mix packet was served check in is very fast boarding passes printed almost immediately but the lines are long and people seem to turn up very late for their flights often which means a lot of queue cutting boarding is mostly a mess but bearable compared to latams lines though aerolneas lines are relatively short the 737max i flew was amazing the engines were extremely quiet and the windows were large and gave a great view the seat is the same as china airlines legroom reasonable for short flights one thing i am critical about is that overhead bin space is very scarce people sometimes have to store stuff 35 rows in front or behind them flight attendants were such a mixed bag some were extremely friendly and open for conversation and some didnt greet you,8.0,7,6,6.0,7.0,7.0,7.0

11886,japan airlines,6,a disappointing experience,melbourne to osaka via tokyo transferring from narita to haneda in tokyo overall this was quite a disappointing experience considering how much more expensive jal is on this route than other carriers with a single stop on all legs the cabin crew were great very welcoming responsive to requests and eager to please all flights operated on time the seating was fine though there is very little storage space in the b787 business class seat in melbourne jal uses the marhaba lounge which is ok but offers no hot vegetarian food options at haneda airport the jal sakura lounge has great views of the runway but food and drink choices were very limited tea coffee soft drinks and rice crackers only no welcome drink prior to takeoff was offered on any sector but after takeoff the cabin crew were very efficient in meeting any requests unfortunately the vegetarian meals were never japanese and ranged from bland to unpleasant im thinking of a certain vegetarian hamburger on board the domestic flight from haneda to osaka kansai the seat was very comfortable and the service was excellent but only tea coffee and soft drinks no snack were served jal does not help business class passengers or provide tickets for the transfer between narita and haneda airports in tokyo you have to make your own way i enquired on checkin in melbourne about that and was just told vaguely that there is a bus it feels like there is a great airline in there struggling to get out but held back by obvious pennypinching,5.0,6,6,6.0,6.0,7.0,6.0
21762,virgin america,3,i dont recommend,los angeles to orlando not really worth the money the first time i flew with them from orlando there was a 25 hour delay without advanced notice they stated the reason that there was a lot traffic in lax i wish they could have let us know earlier not when we were at the gate the second time i flew back from lax my car seat was missing and then they delivered it to my home later in the week however the car seat was broken when we received it i called them to locate the missing part so that we could fix it ourselves people that spoke to were nice but they did not do anything to help me solve the issue but told me to call different departments finally i was told to call central baggage which is voicemail only department called and left voicemail twice but never got a call back our car seat is for our new first baby which is designed for use up to 2 years and we could only use it for 2 months another thing is that i wasnt asking them to pay or compensate i was just asking to help find and deliver the remaining part to us so we could put the car seat together and fix it ourselves but they never contacted us to give us an answer the ticket was 350 round trip but our car seatstrolller system cost about the same its even more costly to fly with virgin america i dont recommend this airline,3.0,3,2,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

21768,virgin america,4,trip was average,los angeles to san francisco this trip was average considering we had booked first class first class did come in useful during checkin security and boarding where we were given priority however on board the service was like economy class other than having a wider seat and more legroom the ife was stowed away in the armrests and took ages for me to pull it out we could not watch anything on it while taxiing taking off climbing or descending the flight attendants were nice when talking to me but did not smile,7.0,6,7,5.0,6.0,5.0,6.0
